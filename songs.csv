Dolly Parton,Jolene,"[Guitar Intro]

[Chorus]
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm beggin' of you, please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can

[Verse 1]
Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your voice is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene

[Verse 2]
He talks about you in his sleep
And there's nothin' I can do to keep
From cryin' when he calls your name, Jolene
And I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene

[Chorus]
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can

[Verse 3]
You could have your choice of men
But I could never love again
He's the only one for me, Jolene
I had to have this talk with you
My happiness depends on you
And whatever you decide to do, Jolene

[Chorus]
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him even though you can
Jolene, Jolene"
Dolly Parton,9 to 5,"[Verse 1]
Tumble out of bed and I stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
And yawn and stretch and try to come to life
Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin'
Out on the street, the traffic starts jumpin'
With folks like me on the job from nine to five

[Chorus]
Workin' nine to five, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
Nine to five, for service and devotion
You would think that I would deserve a fair promotion
Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me
Mmmm

[Verse 2]
They let you dream just to watch 'em shatter
You're just a step on the bossman's ladder
But you've got dreams he'll never take away
In the same boat with a lot of your friends
Waitin' for the day your ship'll come in
And the tide's gonna turn an' it's all gonna roll your way

[Chorus]
Working nine to five, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and you never get the credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
Nine to five, yeah, they got you where they want you
There's a better life and you think about it don't you
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life puttin' money in his wallet
Nine to five, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
Nine to five, yeah, they got you where they want you
There's a better life and you think about it don't you
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life puttin' money in his wallet"
Dolly Parton,Coat of Many Colors,"[Verse 1]
Back through the years I go wandering once again
Back to the seasons of my youth
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us
And how my mama put the rags to use

[Verse 2]
There were rags of many colors, every piece was small
And I didn't have a coat and it was way down in the fall
Mama sewed the rags together sewing every piece with love
She made my coat of many colors that I was so proud of

[Verse 3]
As she sewed, she told a story from the Bible she had read
About a coat of many colors Joseph wore and then she said
Perhaps this coat will bring you good luck and happiness
And I just couldn't wait to wear it and momma blessed it with a kiss

[Bridge 1]
My coat of many colors that my mama made for me
Made only from rags but I wore it so proudly
Although we had no money I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors my mama made for me

[Verse 4]
So with patches on my britches and holes in both my shoes
In my coat of many colors I hurried off to school
Just to find the others laughing and making fun of me
In my coat of many colors my mama made for me

[Verse 5]
But they didn't understand it for I felt I was rich
And I told them of the love my mama sewed in every stitch
And I told them all the story mama told me while she sewed
And how my coat of many colors was worth more than all their clothes

[Bridge 2]
But they didn't understand it and I tried to make them see
That one is only poor only if they choose to be
Now I know we had no money but I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors my mama made for me
Made just for me"
Dolly Parton,I Will Always Love You,"[Verse 1]
If I should stay
I would only be in your way
So I'll go, but I know
I'll think of you each step of the way

[Chorus]
And I will always love you
I will always love you

[Verse 2]
Bittersweet memories
That's all I am taking with me
Goodbye, please don't cry
We both know that I'm not what you need

[Chorus]
But I will always love you
I will always love you

[Bridge]
I hope life treats you kind
And I hope that you have all
That you ever dreamed of
And I wish you joy and happiness
But above all of this, I wish you love

[Chorus]
And I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you"
Dolly Parton,World On Fire,"[Intro]
Oh-oh

[Chorus]
Liar, liar, the world's on fire
What you gonna do when it all burns down?
Fire, fire, burnin' higher
Still got time to turn it all around

[Verse 1]
Now, I ain't one for speakin' out much
But that don't mean I don't stay in touch
Everybody's trippin' over this or that
What we gonna do when we all fall flat?

[Chorus]
Liar, liar, the world's on fire
What we gonna do when it all burns down?

[Verse 2]
I don't know what to think about us
When did we lose ""In God we trust?""
God almighty, what we gonna do?
If God ain't listenin' and we're deaf too

[Chorus]
Liar, liar, the world's on fire
What you gonna do when it all burns down?
Fire, fire, burnin' higher
Still got time to turn it all around

[Verse 3]
Don't get me started on politics
Now how are we to live in a world like this?
Greedy politicians, present and past
They wouldn't know the truth if it bit 'em in the ass

[Interlude]
(What you gonna do?) Now tell me, what is truth?
(What you gonna do?) Have we all lost sight
(What you gonna do?) Of common decency?
(What you gonna do?) Of wrong and right?
How do we heal this great divide?
Do we care enough to try?
But liar, liar, the world's on fire
What we gonna do when it all burns down?

[Verse 4]
Billy got a gun, Joey got a knife
Janie got a sign to carry in the fight
Marchin' in the streets with sticks and stones
Don't you ever believe words don't break bones

[Bridge]
Oh, can't we rise above?
Can't we show some love?
Do we just give up or make a change?
We know all too well
We've all been through hell
Time to break the spell in Heaven's name

[Chorus]
Liar, liar, the world's on fire
What you gonna do when it all burns down?
Fire, fire, burnin' higher (Fire, fire)
Still got time to turn it all around
Liar, liar, the world's on fire
What you gonna do when it all burns down?
Fire, fire, burnin' higher
Still got time to turn it all around

[Outro]
(Liar, liar, the world's on fire)
(What you gonna do when it all burns down?)
(Liar, liar, the world's on fire)
(What you gonna do when it all burns down?)
Show some love (Fire, fire, the world's on fire)
(Still got time to turn it all around)
Let's rise above (Liar, liar, the world's on fire)
(What you gonna do when it all burns down?)
Let's make a stand (Liar, liar, the world's on fire)
(What you gonna do when it all burns down?)
Let's lend a hand (Liar, liar, the world's on fire)
(Still got time to turn it all around)
Let's heal the hurt (Liar, liar, the world's on fire)
(What you gonna do when it all burns down?)
Let kindness work (Liar, liar, the world's on fire)
(What you gonna do when it all burns down?)
Let's be a friend (Liar, liar, the world's on fire)
(What you gonna do when it all burns down?)
Let hatred end (Liar, liar, the world's on fire)
(What you gonna do?)
Liar, liar, the world's on fire
What you gonna do when it all burns down?
Liar, liar, the world's on fire
What you gonna do when it all burns down?"
Dolly Parton,Hard Candy Christmas,"[Verse 1]
Hey, maybe I'll dye my hair
Maybe I'll move somewhere
Maybe I'll get a car
Maybe I'll drive so far
They'll all lose track
Me, I'll bounce right back
Maybe I'll sleep real late
Maybe I'll lose some weight
Maybe I'll clear my junk
Maybe I'll just get drunk on apple wine
Me, I'll be just

[Chorus]
Fine and dandy
Lord it's like a hard candy Christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
But still I won't let
Sorrow bring me way down
I'll be fine and dandy
Lord it's like a hard candy Christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
But still I won't let
Sorrow bring me way down

[Verse 2]
Hey, maybe I'll learn to sew
Maybe I'll just lie low
Maybe I'll hit the bars
Maybe I'll count the stars until dawn
Me, I will go on

Maybe I'll settle down
Maybe I'll just leave town
Maybe I'll have some fun
Maybe I'll meet someone
And make him mine
Me, I'll be just

[Chorus]
Fine and dandy
Lord it's like a hard candy Christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
But still I won't let
Sorrow bring me way down
I'll be fine and dandy
Lord it's like a hard candy Christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
But still I won't let
Sorrow bring me way down
I'll be fine and dandy
Lord it's like a hard candy Christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
But still I won't let
Sorrow bring me way down

[Outro]
Because I'll be fine
(I'll be fine)
Oh, I'll be fine"
Dolly Parton,Just Because I’m a Woman,"[Verse 1]
I can see you're disappointed
By the way you look at me
And I'm sorry that I'm not
The woman you thought I'd be

[Verse 2]
Yes, I've made my mistakes
But listen and understand
My mistakes are no worse than yours
Just because I'm a woman

[Verse 3]
So when you look at me
Don't feel sorry for yourself
Just think of all the shame
You might have brought somebody else
Just let me tell you this
Then we'll both know where we stand

[Bridge]
My mistakes are no worse than yours
Just because I'm a woman

[Verse 4]
Now a man will take a good girl
And he'll ruin her reputation
But when he wants to marry
Well, that's a different situation

[Verse 5]
He'll just walk off and leave her
To do the best she can
While he looks for an angel
To wear his wedding band

[Verse 6]
Now I know that I'm no angel
If that's what you thought you'd found
I was just the victim of
A man that lets me down

[Outro]
No, my mistakes are no worse than yours
Just because I'm a woman"
Dolly Parton,Here You Come Again,"[Verse 1]
Here you come again
Just when I'd begun to get myself together
You waltz right in the door
Just like you've done before
And wrap my heart 'round your little finger

[Verse 2]
Here you come again
Just when I'm about to make it work without you
You look into my eyes
And lie those pretty lies
And pretty soon I'm wondering' how I came to doubt you

[Chorus]
All you got to do is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you and in a little while
You're messing' up my mind and filling' up my senses

[Verse 3]
Here you come again
Looking' better than a body has a right to
And shaking' me up so that all I really know
Is here you come again
And here I go

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus]
All you got to do is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you and in a little while
You're messing' up my mind and filling' up my senses

[Verse 4]
Here you come again
Looking' better than a body has a right to
And shaking' me up so
That all I really know
Is here you come again
And here I go
Here I go
And here I go
And here I go
Here you come again
And here I go
Here I go
And here I go
Here I go"
Dolly Parton,Berry Pie,"Berry pie, a berry pie

Dolly Parton,Two Doors Down,"[Chorus]
Two doors down, they're laughin' and drinkin' and having a party
Two doors down, they're not aware that I'm around
But I here I am crying my heart out, feeling sorry
They're having a party two doors down

[Verse 1]
I think I'll dry these useless tears and get myself together
I think I'll wander down the hall and have a look around
'Cause I can't stay inside this lonely room and cry forever
I think I'd really rather join 'em two door down, yeah

[Chorus]
Two doors down, they're laughin' and drinkin' and having a party
Two doors down, they're not aware that I'm around
Here I am, no longer crying and feeling sorry
They're having a party two doors down

[Verse 2]
I can't believe I'm standing here, dry-eyed, all smiles and talking
Making conversation with the new love I have found
I asked him if he'd like to be alone and we start walkin'
Down the hall to my place waiting two doors down, yeah

[Chorus]
Two doors down, they're laughin' and drinkin' and having a party
Two doors town, we're not aware that they're around
But I here I am feeling everything but sorry
We're having our own party two doors down

[Breakdown]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, two doors down
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, two doors down
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, two doors down
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, two doors down, oh

We're having our own party two doors down, yeah
Two doors down, they're laughin' and drinkin' and having a party
Two doors down, we're not aware that they're around
Here we are feelin' everything but sorry
We're having our own party two doors down"
Dolly Parton,Cracker Jack,"[Verse 1]
Once I had a little dog, I called him Cracker Jack
He had a spot around one eye that looked just like a patch
His legs were way too long and he was awkward as could be
He wasn't much to look at but he looked alright to me
I found him by the river bank just wandering about
He was cold and hungry and his ribs were sticking out
I snapped my fingers, whistled, when he came, I picked him up
I was just a kid and Cracker Jack was just a pup
I took him home and fed him 'til he couldn't eat no more
I took him to my room and put a blanket on the floor
After that beside my bed is where he'd always sleep
Each night in my prayers I'd pray the lord his soul to keep

[Chorus]
Cracker Jack
The best friend that I ever had was Cracker Jack
But he was more than that
A playmate, a companion
He was love and understanding
That was Cracker Jack
The best friend that I ever had was Cracker Jack
But he was more than that
Everything a kid could want I had in Cracker Jack

[Verse 2]
Cracker Jack would run to meet me after school each day
He'd jump and wag his tail and look at me as if to say
""I love you and I've missed you and I'm glad you're home again""
I knew just how he felt 'cause me and Cracker Jack was friends
Through the woods and fields we would often roam about
And when we got in trouble we would help each other out
I could run almost as fast as Cracker Jack could run
We had a lot in common and we had a lot of fun
He was always with me when I was growing up
We shared each other's good times and we shared each other's love
He only lives in memories now but often I think back
To the days of childhood, the days of Cracker Jack

[Chorus]
Cracker Jack
The best friend that I ever had was Cracker Jack
But he was more than that
A playmate, a companion
He was love and understanding
That was Cracker Jack
The best friend that I ever had was Cracker Jack
But he was more then that
Everything a kid could want I had in Cracker Jack"
Dolly Parton,From Here to the Moon and Back (2014),"I could hold out my arms, say ""I love you this much""
I could tell you how long I will long for your touch
How much and how far would I go to prove
The depth and the breadth of my love for you?

From here to the moon and back
Who else in this world will love you like that?
Love everlasting, I promise you that
From here to the moon and back
From here to the moon and back

I want you to know you can always depend
On promises made and love without end
No need to wonder how faithful I'll be
Now and on into eternity

From here to the moon and back
Who else in this world will love you like that?
Forever and always, I'll be where you're at
From here to the moon and back
From here to the moon and back

I would blow you a kiss from the star where I sat
I would call out your name to echo through the vast
Thank heaven for you and to God, tip my hat
From here to the moon and back
And I'll spend forever just proving that fact
From here to the moon and back"
Dolly Parton,Girl in the Movies,"[Verse 1]
Popcorn, soda, box of Raisinets
Velvet-cushioned seats and soft armrests
Best seat in my favorite movie house
Start my dreaming as the lights go out
Up on the silver screen, I picture me
Living out my passions, hopes, and fantasies

[Chorus 1]
I want to be the girl in the movies
The one with the glint in her eyes
The girl that seldom loses
Beautiful, with grace and style
Acting out her story
Standing in her glory
Happy ever after
I want to be the girl in the movies

[Verse 2]
Wish I had a nickel for each dime I've spent
Watching others live their lives with confidence
Here's a preview of some things to come
It's not too late for me to be someone
I can't keep living in their make-believe
Coming attractions will be starring me

[Chorus 2]
I want to be the girl in the movies
The one with the stars in her eyes (In her eyes)
She gets the roles she chooses
She can laugh or she can cry
Acting in her story
Standing in her glory
Always happy endings
I want to be the girl in the movies

[Bridge]
It's time I show the world just what I'm about
I'm steppin' up and I'm steppin' out
I'm feelin' bold and I'm feelin' proud
I want to be that girl

[Chorus 3]
I want to be the girl in the movies
Hmm hmm
I want to be the girl in the movies
Hmm hmm hmm

[Verse 3]
Gonna stand up
And I'm gonna matter
'Cause I've had enough of my dreams being shattered
And I've had enough of my tears being splattered
I've already been that girl

[Outro]
Oh, I want to be (I want to be)
I want to be (I want to be)
I want to be the girl in the movies
I want to be (I want to be)
Hey look at me (Hey look at me)
I want to be the girl in the movies
I want to shine (I want to shine)
I want to shine (I'm gonna shine)
It's my time
And I want to shine
I want to be happy, I want to be free
Just like the girl in the movies"
Dolly Parton,Dumb Blonde,"[Verse 1]
Don't try to cry your way out of this
Don't try to lie or I'll catch you in it
Don't try to make me feel sorry for you
Just because I'm blonde
Don't think I'm dumb
'Cause this dumb blonde ain't nobody's fool

[Pre-Chorus]
When you left you thought I'd sit
And you thought I'd wait
And you thought I'd cry
You called me a dumb blonde (Dumb blonde)
Ah, but somehow I lived through it
And you know if there's one thing this blonde has learned
Blondes have more fun

[Chorus]
You flew too high up off the ground
It's stormy weather and had to come back down
But I've found new thread for my old spool
Just because I'm blonde
Don't think I'm dumb
'Cause this dumb blonde ain't nobody's fool

[Pre-Chorus]
When you left you thought I'd sit
And you thought I'd wait
And you thought I'd cry
You called me a dumb blonde
Ah, but somehow I lived through it
And you know if there's one thing this blonde has learned
Blondes have more fun

You flew too high up off the ground
It's stormy weather and had to come back down
But I've found new thread for my old spool
Just because I'm blonde

Dolly Parton,Why’d You Come in Here Lookin’ Like That,"Why'd you come in here looking like that?
In your cowboy boots and your painted-on jeans
All decked out like a cowgirl's dream
Why'd you come in here looking like that?

Here comes my baby dragging my heart behind
He's drivin' me crazy, who says love is blind?
He's got a wandering eye and a traveling mind
Big ideas and a little behind
Out with a different woman every night
But I remember when he was mine

Why'd you come in here looking like that?
In your high heeled boots and your painted-on jeans
All decked out like a cowgirl's dream
Waltzing right in here lookin' like that
Why'd you come in here looking like that?
When you could stop traffic in a gunny sack
Why, you're almost giving me a heart attack
When you waltz right in here lookin' like that

I just can't stand it to see him on the town
He's out slow dancing with every girl around
I'm a soft-hearted woman, he's a hardheaded man
And he's gonna make me feel just as bad as he can
He's got himself a mean streak a half a mile wide
But now he's dancing on this heart of mine

Why'd you come in here looking like that?
In your high heel boots and your painted-on jeans
All decked out like a cowgirl's dream
Why'd you come in here looking like that?

Why'd you come in here looking like that?
In your cowboy boots and your painted-on jeans
All decked out like a cowgirl's dream
Why'd you come in here looking like that?
Why'd you come in here looking like that?
When you could stop traffic in a gunny sack
Why, you're almost giving me a heart attack
When you waltz right in here lookin' like that
Why'd you come in here looking like that?
Why'd you come in here looking like that?"
Dolly Parton,Me and Little Andy,"[Verse 1]
Late one cold and stormy night I heard a dog a-barkin'
Then I thought I heard somebody at my door a-knockin'
I wondered who could be outside in such an awful storm
And then I saw a little girl with a puppy in her arms
Before I could say a word she said, ""My name is Sandy
And this here is my puppy dog, its name is little Andy""
Standing in the bitter cold in just a ragged dress
Then I asked her to come in and this is what she said

[Chorus]
""Ain't ya got no gingerbread? Ain't ya got no candy?
Ain't you got an extra bed for me and little Andy?
Patty cake and bakersman, my mommy ran away again
And we was all alone and didn't know what else to do
I wonder if you'll let us stay with you?""

[Verse 2]
Giddy up trotty horse, going to the mill
Can we stay all night?
If you don't love us, no one will
I promise we won't cry
London Bridge is falling down
My daddy's drunk again in town
And we was all alone and didn't know what we could do
We wondered if you'd let us stay with you?

[Bridge]
She was just a little girl, not more than six or seven
But that night as they slept, the angels took them both to heaven
God knew little Andy would be lonesome with her gone
Now Sandy and her puppy dog won't ever be alone

[Chorus]
""Ain't ya got no gingerbread? Ain't ya got no candy?
Ain't you got an extra bed for me and little Andy?"""
Dolly Parton,The Bridge,"[Verse 1]
The bridge, so high
The bridge, so tall
Here is where it started
On the bridge
The moon is big and yellow
And the stars are all a' glow
From the bridge, I see reflections
In the waters far below

[Verse 2]
You kissed me for the first time here
An' held me awfully tight
And the bridge became our favorite place
We came here often in the night

[Verse 3]
And one night while standing on the bridge
Desire swept through us both
Passion took us by the hand
And showed us where to go

[Verse 4]
From the bridge we saw a meadow
So we ran together there
Where we found love together
Our emotions filled the air

[Bridge]
The bridge, so wide
The bridge, so long
Where once we stood together
Tonight I stand alone

[Verse 5]
Tonight, while standing on the bridge
My heart is beating wild
To think that you could leave me here
With our unborn child

[Verse 6]
My feet are moving slowly
Closer to the edge
Here is where it started
And here is where I'll end it"

Dolly Parton,Before the Next Teardrop Falls,"[Verse 1]
If she brings you happiness
Then I wish you both the best
It's your happiness that matters most of all
But if she ever breaks your heart
If the teardrops ever start
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls

[Verse 2]
Though it hurts to let you go
Darling I want you to know
I'll run to you if ever you should call
And if I should ever hear
That she's made you shed a tear
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls

[Chorus]
I'll be there anytime you need me by your side
To dry away each teardrop you've cried
If she ever leaves you blue
Just remember I love you
And I'll be there
Before the next teardrop falls

[Verse 3]
Alli Estare Candor me necesites a tu lado
Para borrar cadda lagrima que haya llorado
If he ever leaves you blue
Just remember I love you
And I'll be there
Before the next teardrop falls

[Outro]
I'll be there, I'll be there
Before the next teardrop falls"
Dolly Parton,Old Flames (Can’t Hold a Candle to You),"[Verse 1]
Downtown tonight I saw an old friend
Someone who I use to take comfort from long before I met you
I caught a spark from his eyes of forgotten desire
With a word, or a touch, I could have rekindled that fire

[Chorus]
Old flames can't hold a candle to you
No one can light up the night like you do
Flickering embers of love, I've known one or two
Old flames can't hold a candle to you

[Verse 2]
Sometimes at night I think of old lovers I've known
I remember how holding them helped me not feel so alone
Then I feel you beside me and even their memories are gone
Like stars in the night lost in the sweet light of dawn

[Chorus]
Old flames can't hold a candle to you
No one can light up the night like you do
Flickering embers of love, I've known one or two
Old flames can't hold a candle to you"
Dolly Parton,Do I Ever Cross Your Mind,"[Verse 1]
Oh, sometimes I go walking through fields where we walked
Long ago in the sweet used to be
And the flowers still grow, but they don't smell as sweet
As they did when you picked them for me

[Chorus]
And when I think of you and the love we once knew
How I wish we could go back in time
Do you ever think back on old memories like that
Or do I ever cross your mind?

[Bridge]
Do you ever wake up lonely in the middle of the night because you miss me
Do you, darling?
Oh, and do your memories ever take
You back into another place in time?
Oh, and do you ever miss the feelings and the love we shared when you were with me
Do you, darling?
I just wonder, do I cross your mind?

[Verse 2]
Oh, how often I wish that again I could kiss your sweet lips like I did long ago
And how often I long for those two lovin' arms that once held me so gentle and close

[Chorus]
And when I think of you and the love we once knew, how I wish we could go back in time
Do you ever recall these old memories at all, or do I ever cross your mind?

[Bridge]
Do you ever wake up lonely in the middle of the night because you miss me, do you darling?
Oh, and do your memories ever take
You back into another place in time?
Oh, and do you ever miss the feeling and the love we shared when you were with me, do you darling?
I just wonder, do I cross your mind?

[Outro]
Or do I ever cross your mind?

Tell me, do I ever?
Do I?
Do I ever?
Do I?
Do I ever cross your mind?

Darling, do I ever?
Do I?
Do I ever?
Do I?
Do I ever cross your mind?

Tell me, do I ever?
Do I?
Do I ever?
Do I?
Do I ever cross your mind?"
Dolly Parton,Backwoods Barbie,"[Verse 1]
I grew up poor and ragged, just a simple country girl
I wanted to be pretty more than anything in the world
Like Barbie or the models in the Fredricks catalog
From rags to wishes in my dreams I could have it all

[Chorus]
I'm just a Backwoods Barbie, too much makeup, too much hair
Don't be fooled by thinking that the goods are not all there
Don't let these false eyelashes lead you to believe that
I'm as shallow as I look cause I run true and deep

[Verse 2]
I've always been misunderstood because of how I look
Don't judge me by the cover cause I'm a real good book
So read into it what you will, but see me as I am
The way I look is just a country girl's idea of glam

[Chorus]
I'm just a Backwoods Barbie in a push-up bra and heels
I might look artificial, but where it counts I'm real
And I'm all dolled up and hoping for a chance to prove my worth
And even Backwoods Barbie's get their feelings hurt

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
I'm just a Backwoods Barbie, too much makeup, too much hair
Don't be fooled by thinking that the goods are not all there
Yes, I can see where I could be misjudged upon first glance
But even Backwoods Barbie's deserve a second chance
I'm just a Backwoods Barbie just asking for a chance
Just a Backwoods Barbie"
Dolly Parton,Light of a Clear Blue Morning,"It's been a long dark night
And I've been a-waiting for the morning
It's been a long hard fight
But I see a brand new day dawning
I've been looking for the sunshine
You know I ain't seen it in so long
But everything's gonna work out just fine
And everything's gonna be all right
That's been all wrong

'Cause I can see the light of a clear blue morning
I can see the light of a brand new day
I can see the light of a clear blue morning
Oh and everything's gonna be all right
It's gonna be okay

It's been a long long time
Since I've known the taste of freedom
And those clinging vines
That had me bound, well I don't need 'em
I've been like a captured eagle
You know an eagle is born to fly
Now that I have won my freedom
Like an eagle, I am eager to fly

'Cause I can see the light of a clear blue morning
I can see the light of a brand new day
I can see the light of a clear blue morning
Oh and everything's gonna be all right
It's gonna be okay

I can see the light of a clear blue morning
I can see the light of a brand new day
I can see the light of a clear blue morning
Oh and everything's gonna be all right
Everything's gonna be all right
Everything's gonna be all right
It's gonna be ok

'Cause I can see the light of a clear blue morning
I can see the light of a brand new day
I can see the light of a clear blue morning
And everything's gonna be all right
Everything's gonna be all right
Everything's gonna be all right
It's gonna be okay

'Cause I can see the light of a clear blue morning
I can see the light of a brand new day
I can see the light of a clear blue morning
And everything's gonna be all right
Everything's gonna be all right
Everything's gonna be all right
It's gonna be okay"
Dolly Parton,Little Sparrow,"[Chorus]
Little sparrow, little sparrow
Precious fragile little thing
Little sparrow, little sparrow
Flies so high and feels no pain

[Verse 1]
All ye maidens, heed my warning
Never trust the hearts of men
They will crush you like a sparrow
Leaving you to never mend
They will vow to always love you
Swear no love but yours will do
Then they'll leave you for another
Break your little heart in two

[Chorus]
Little sparrow, little sparrow
Precious fragile little thing
Little sparrow, little sparrow
Flies so high and feels no pain

[Verse 2]
If I were a little sparrow
Over these mountains I would fly
I would find him, I would find him
Look into his lying eyes
I would flutter all around him
On my little sparrow wings
I would ask him, I would ask him
Why he let me love in vain
I am not a little sparrow
I am just the broken dream
Of a cold false-hearted lover
And his evil cunning scheme

[Chorus]
Little sparrow, little sparrow
Precious fragile little thing
Little sparrow, little sparrow
Flies so high and feels no pain
All ye maidens fair and tender
Never trust the hearts of men
They will crush you like a sparrow
Leaving you to never mend

[Outro]
Little sparrow, little sparrow
Oh, the sorrow never ends"
Johnny Cash,You Are My Sunshine,"[Verse 1]
The other night dear, as I lay sleeping
I dreamed I held you in my arms
When I awoke, dear, I was mistaken
So I bowed my head and I cried

[Chorus]
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know, dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
I've always loved you and made you happy
And nothing else could come between
But now you've left me to love another
You have shattered all of my dreams

[Chorus]
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know, dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

[Spoken Outro]
(I always hated that third verse)
*Laughter*
It was a nice short version
Do you wanna- uh, pick it up?
I't's alright (It's good)
(We got a short version)
It might have that other verse on it in another take
Well, I'll tell you what... Let's... uhm...
Well, if I feel like my song's a song... *Laughter*
It don't care... (There you go!)
I don't care if it's short
And I feel like my song's a song
A pleasure! Two minutes... I've recorded songs two minutes
(They were huge hits!)
Have you got, uh, time on that?"
Johnny Cash,Folsom Prison Blues,"[Verse 1]
I hear the train a-comin', it's rolling 'round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a-rollin' on down to San Antone

[Verse 2]
When I was just a baby, my mama told me, ""Son
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns""
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowin', I hang my head and cry

[Verse 3]
I bet there's rich folks eatin' in a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars
Well, I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
But those people keep a-movin', and that's what tortures me

[Verse 4]
Well, if they freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away"
Johnny Cash,Ring of Fire,"[Verse 1]
Love is a burning thing
And it makes a fiery ring
Bound by wild desire
I fell into a ring of fire

[Chorus]
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire

[Verse 2]
The taste of love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
Oh, but the fire went wild

[Chorus]
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire

[Outro]
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
The ring..."
Johnny Cash,Hurt,"[Produced by Rick Rubin]

[Verse 1]
I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

[Chorus]
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

[Verse 2]
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

[Chorus]
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

[Outro]
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"
Johnny Cash,I Walk The Line,"[Verse 1]
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line

[Verse 2]
I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day's through
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine, I walk the line

[Verse 3]
As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line

[Verse 4]
You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you, I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine, I walk the line

[Verse 1]
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line"
Johnny Cash,The Man Comes Around,"[Intro]
""And I heard, as it were, the noise of thunder
One of the four beasts saying, 'Come and see'
And I saw, and behold a white horse""

[Verse 1]
There's a man goin' 'round takin' names
And he decides who to free and who to blame
Everybody won't be treated all the same
There'll be a golden ladder reachin' down
When the man comes around

[Verse 2]
The hairs on your arm will stand up
At the terror in each sip and in each sup
Will you partake of that last offered cup
Or disappear into the potter's ground?
When the man comes around

[Chorus]
Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers
One hundred million angels singin'
Multitudes are marchin' to the big kettledrum
Voices callin', voices cryin'
Some are born and some are dyin'
It's Alpha and Omega's kingdom come
And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks

[Verse 3]
Till Armageddon, no shalam, no shalom
Then the father hen will call his chickens home
The wise men will bow down before the throne
And at his feet, they'll cast their golden crowns
When the man comes around

[Verse 4]
Whoever is unjust, let him be unjust still
Whoever is righteous, let him be righteous still
Whoever is filthy, let him be filthy still
Listen to the words long written down
When the man comes around

[Chorus]
Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers
One hundred million angels singin'
Multitudes are marchin' to the big kettledrum
Voices callin', voices cryin'
Some are born and some are dyin'
It's Alpha and Omega's kingdom come
And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks
In measured hundredweight and penny pound
When the man comes around

[Outro]
""And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts [...]
And I looked, and behold a pale horse:
And his name that sat on him was Death
And Hell followed with him"""
Johnny Cash,God’s Gonna Cut You Down,"[Chorus 1]
You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down

[Chorus 2]
Go tell that long-tongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back-biter
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down

[Verse 1]
Well, my goodness gracious, let me tell you the news
My head's been wet with the midnight dew
I've been down on bended knee, talkin' to the man from Galilee
He spoke to me in the voice so sweet
I thought I heard the shuffle of angels' feet
He called my name and my heart stood still
When he said, ""John, go do My will!""

[Chorus 2]
Go tell that long-tongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back-biter
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down

[Chorus 1]
You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down
[Verse 2]
Well, you may throw your rock, and hide your hand
Workin' in the dark against your fellow man
But as sure as God made black and white
What's done in the dark will be brought to the light

[Chorus 1]
You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down

[Chorus 2]
Go tell that long-tongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back-biter
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut you down
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut you down
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut you down"
Johnny Cash,Cocaine Blues (At Folsom Prison),"[Verse 1]
Early one morning, while making the rounds
I took a shot of cocaine, and I shot my woman down
I went right home, and I went to bed
I stuck that loving .44 beneath my head
Got up next morning, and I grabbed that gun
Took a shot of cocaine, and away I run
Made a good run, but I run too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez, Mexico

[Verse 2]
Laid in the hot joints, taking the pills
In walked the Sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said, ""Willy Lee, your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down""
""Yes, oh yes, my name is Willy Lee
If you've got a warrant, just a-read it to me
Shot her down because she made me slow
I thought I was her daddy, but she had five more""

[Verse 3]
When I was arrested I was dressed in black
They put me on a train, and they took me back
Had no friend for to go my bail
They slapped my dried up carcass in that county jail
Early next morning, 'bout a half past nine
I spied a Sheriff coming down the line
Hocked and he coughed as he cleared his throat
He said, ""Come on you dirty hack into that district court""

[Verse 4]
Into the courtroom, my trial began
Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw that little judge commence to look about
In about five minutes, in walked a man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read, ""In the first degree...""
I hollered, ""Lordy, Lordy, have mercy on me""
The judge, he smiled as he picked up his pen
Ninety-nine years in the Folsom Pen
Ninety-nine years underneath that ground
I can't forget the day I shot that bad bitch down

[Outro]
Come all, you've got to listen unto me
Lay off that whiskey, and let that cocaine be

[Spoken Word:  Hugh Cherry, Inmate & Johnny Cash]
""These men have receptions
Matlock A50632, and Batshelter A39879
They have receptions""
Is that gonna be on the album?
Yeah
I doubt that"
Johnny Cash,A Boy Named Sue,"[Intro]
""I want you to, if you don't mind, Carl, I'd like you to stay out and help us on some songs, play the guitar.""
""I'd love to!""
""One of the greatest guitar players as well as songwriters and singers in the business. Appreciate a little help on the guitar, all right?""

[Verse 1]
Well, my daddy left home when I was three
And he didn't leave much to ma and me
Just this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze
Now, I don't blame him 'cause he run and hid
But the meanest thing that he ever did
Was before he left, he went and named me ""Sue""

[Verse 2]
Well, he must've thought that it was quite a joke
And it got a lot of laughs from a lots of folks
It seems I had to fight my whole life through
Some gal would giggle and I'd get red
And some guy'd laugh then I'd bust his head
I tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named ""Sue""

[Verse 3]
Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean
My fists got hard and my wits got keen
Roamed from town to town to hide my shame
But I made me a vow to the Moon and stars
I'd search the honky-tonks and bars
And kill the man who gave me that awful name

[Verse 4]
Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July
And I just hit town and my throat was dry
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew
At an old saloon on a street of mud
There at a table, dealing stud
Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me ""Sue""

[Verse 5]
Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a worn-out picture that my mother'd had
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye
He was big and bent and gray and old
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold
And I said, ""My name is Sue! How do you do?
Now you gonna die!""
Yeah, that's what I told him!

[Verse 6]
Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down, but to my surprise
He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear
But I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the wall and into the street
Kicking and a-gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer

[Verse 7]
I tell you, I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile
I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss
And he went for his gun and I pulled mine first
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile

[Verse 8]
And he said, ""Son, this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
And I knew I wouldn't be there to help you along
So I give you that name and I said goodbye
I knew you'd have to get tough or die
And it's that name that helped to make you strong""
Yeah

[Verse 9]
He said, ""Now you just fought one hell of a fight
And I know you hate me and you got the right
To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do
But you ought to thank me, before I die
For the gravel in your guts and the spit in your eye
Because I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue""

Yeah, but what could I do?
What could I do?

[Verse 10]
I got all choked up and I threw down my gun
And I called him my pa, and he called me a son
And I came away with a different point of view
And I think about him, now and then
Every time I try and every time I win
And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him
Bill or George! Any damn thing but Sue! I still hate that name!"
Johnny Cash,I’ve Been Everywhere,"[Intro]
I was totin' my pack along the dusty Winnemucca road
When along came a semi with a high an' canvas covered load
""If you're goin' to Winnemucca, Mack, with me you can ride""
And so I climbed into the cab and then I settled down inside
He asked me if I'd seen a road with so much dust and sand
And I said, ""Listen, I've traveled every road in this here land""

[Chorus]

Johnny Cash,Man in Black,"[Verse 1]
Well, you wonder why I always dress in black
Why you never see bright colors on my back
And why does my appearance seem to have a somber tone
Well, there's a reason for the things that I have on

[Verse 2]
I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down
Living in the hopeless, hungry side of town
I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime
But is there because he's a victim of the time

[Verse 3]
I wear the black for those who've never read
Or listened to the words that Jesus said
About the road to happiness through love and charity
Why, you'd think He's talking straight to you and me

[Verse 4]
Well, we're doing mighty fine, I do suppose
In our streak-of-lightning cars and fancy clothes
But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back
Up front there ought to be a man in black

[Verse 5]
I wear it for the sick and lonely old
For the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold
I wear the black in mourning for the lives that could have been
Each week we lose a hundred fine young men
[Verse 6]
And I wear it for the thousands who have died
Believing that the Lord was on their side
I wear it for another hundred-thousand who have died
Believing that we all were on their side

[Verse 7]
Well, there's things that never will be right, I know
And things need changing everywhere you go
But 'til we start to make a move to make a few things right
You'll never see me wear a suit of white

[Verse 8]
Ah, I'd love to wear a rainbow every day
And tell the world that everything's okay
But I'll try to carry off a little darkness on my back
Until things are brighter, I'm the Man In Black"
Johnny Cash,One,"[Verse 1]
Is it getting better
Or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you, now
You got someone to blame?

[Chorus]
You said one love, one life
When it's one need in the night
One love, we get to share it
It leaves you, baby, if you don't care for it

[Verse 2]
Did I disappoint you
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without

[Chorus]
Well, it's too late tonight
To drag the past out into the light
We're one, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other
One

[Verse 3]
Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head?

[Chorus]
Did I ask too much? More than a lot
You gave me nothing, now it's all I got
We're one, but we're not the same
Well, we hurt each other, and we're doing it again

[Bridge]
You say love is a temple, love the higher law
Love is a temple, love the higher law
You ask me to enter, but then you make me crawl
And I can't be holding on to what you've got
When all you've got is hurt

[Final Chorus]
One love, one blood
One life, you've got to do what you should
One life with each other
Sisters, brothers
One life, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other
One
One"
Johnny Cash,Big River,"[Verse 1]
Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry
And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'm gonna sit right here until I die

[Verse 2]
I met her accidentally in St. Paul, Minnesota
And it tore me up every time I heard her drawl, Southern drawl
Then I heard my dream went back downstream, cavorting in Davenport
And I followed you, big river, when you called

[Verse 3]
Then you took me to St. Louis later on down the river
A freighter said she's been here, but she's gone, boy, she's gone
I found her trail in Memphis, but she just walked up the bluff
She raised a few eyebrows and then she went on down alone

[Verse 4]
Now, won't you batter down by Baton Rouge, River Queen, roll it on
Take that woman on down to New Orleans, New Orleans
Go on, I've had enough, dump my blues down in the Gulf
She loves you, big river, more than me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 1]
Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry, cry, cry
And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'm gonna sit right here until I die"
Johnny Cash,Ain’t No Grave (Gonna Hold This Body Down),"[Produced by Rick Rubin]

[Chorus]
There ain't no grave
Can hold my body down
There ain't no grave
Can hold my body down

[Verse 1]
When I hear that trumpet sound
I'm going to rise right out of the ground
Ain't no grave
Can hold my body down
Well, look way down the river
And what do you think I see
I see a band of angels
And they're coming after me

[Chorus]
Ain't no grave
Can hold my body down
There ain't no grave
Can hold my body down

[Verse 2]
Well, look down yonder, Gabriel
Put your feet on the land and sea
But Gabriel, don't you blow your trumpet
Until you hear from me

[Chorus]
There ain't no grave
Can hold my body down
Ain't no grave
Can hold my body down

[Verse 3]
Well meet me, Jesus, meet me
Meet me in the middle of the air
And if these wings don't fail me
I will meet you anywhere

[Chorus]
Ain't no grave
Can hold my body down
There ain't no grave
Can hold my body down

[Verse 4]
Well meet me, Mother and Father
Meet me down the river road
And Mama, you know that I'll be there
When I check in my load

[Chorus]
Ain't no grave
Can hold my body down
There ain't no grave
Can hold my body down
There ain't no grave
Can hold my body down"
Johnny Cash,Ghost Riders in the Sky,"[Verse 1]
An old cowboy went ridin' out one dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw
Plowin' through the ragged skies, and up a cloudy draw

[Verse 2]
Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny, and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders coming hard, and he heard their mournful cry

[Chorus]
Yippie-yi-oh, yippie-yi-aie!
Ghost riders in the sky

[Verse 3]
Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
He's ridin' hard to catch that herd, but he ain't caught 'em yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
On horses snortin' fire, as they ride on, hear their cry

[Verse 4]
As the riders loped on by him, he heard one call his name
""If you want to save your soul from Hell, a-ridin' on our range
Then cowboy, change your ways today, or with us you will ride
Tryin' to catch the Devil's herd, across these endless skies""

[Chorus]
Yippie-yi-oh, yippie-yi-aie!
Ghost riders in the sky
Ghost riders in the sky
Ghost riders in the sky"
Johnny Cash,The Long Black Veil,"[Verse 1]
Ten years ago on a cold dark night
Someone was killed 'neath the town hall light
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me

[Chorus]
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

[Verse 2]
The Judge said, ""Son, what is your alibi?
If you were somewhere else, you won't have to die""
I spoke not a word, though it meant my life
I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife

Now the scaffold seemed high, and eternity was near
She stood in the crowd, but she shed not a tear
But some times at night when the cold wind calls
She comes to my grave and she moans o'er my bones

[Chorus]
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

[Outro]
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me"
Johnny Cash,I Still Miss Someone,"[Verse]
At my door the leaves are falling
A cold wild wind will come
Sweethearts walk by together
And I still miss someone
I go out on a party
And look for a little fun
But I find a darkened corner
Because I still miss someone

Oh, I never got over those blues eyes
I see them every where
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there
I wonder if she's sorry
For leaving what we'd begun
There's someone for me somewhere
And I still miss someone

I still miss someone

Oh, I never got over those blue eyes
I see them every where
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there
I wonder if she's sorry
For leaving what we'd begun
There's someone for me somewhere
And I still miss someone
I still miss someone"
Johnny Cash,Wayfaring Stranger,"[Verse 1]
I'm just a poor wayfaring stranger
Travelling through this world below
There's no sickness, no toil, nor danger
In that bright land to which I go
I'm going there to see my Father
And all my loved ones who've gone on
I'm just going over Jordan
I'm just going over home

[Verse 2]
I know dark clouds will gather around me
I know my way is hard and steep
But beauteous fields arise before me
Where God's redeemed, their vigils keep
I'm going there to see my Mother
She said she'd meet me when I come
So, I'm just going over Jordan
I'm just going over home

[Outro]
I'm just going over Jordan
I'm just going over home"
Johnny Cash,Cry! Cry! Cry!,"[Verse 1]
Everybody knows where you go when the sun goes down
I think you only live to see the lights of town
I wasted my time when I would try, try, try
'Cause when the lights have lost their glow, you'll cry, cry, cry

[Verse 2]
Soon your sugar daddies will all be gone
You'll wake up some cold day and find you're alone
You'll call for me, but I'm gonna tell you, ""Bye, bye, bye""
When I turn around and walk away, you'll cry, cry, cry

[Chorus]
You're gonna cry, cry, cry, and you'll cry alone
When everyone's forgotten, and you're left on your own
You're gonna cry, cry, cry

[Verse 3]
I lie awake at night to wait 'til you come in
You stay a little while and then you're gone again
Every question that I ask, I get a lie, lie, lie
For every lie you tell, you're gonna cry, cry, cry

[Verse 4]
When your fickle love gets old, no one will care for you
Then you'll come back to me for a little love that's true
I'll tell you no, and then you'll ask me, ""Why, why, why?""
When I remind you of all of this, you'll cry, cry, cry

[Chorus]
You're gonna cry, cry, cry, and you'll want me then
It'll hurt when you think of the fool you've been
You're gonna cry, cry, cry"
Johnny Cash,I Won’t Back Down,"[Verse 1]
Well, I won't back down
No, I won't back down
You can stand me up at the gates of hell
But I won't back down
Gonna stand my ground, won't be turned around
And I'll keep this world from dragging me down
Gonna stand my ground, and I won't back down

[Chorus]
Hey baby, there ain't no easy way out
Hey, I will stand my ground, and I won't back down

[Verse 2]
Well, I know what's right, I got just one life
In a world that keeps on pushing me around
But I stand my ground, and I won't back down

[Chorus]
Hey baby, there ain't no easy way out
Hey, I will stand my ground, and I won't back down

[Outro]
No, I won't back down"
Johnny Cash,Chicken in Black,"[Verse 1: Johnny Cash]
For two long years my head hurt bad
So the doctor checked me and he shook his head
He said, ""I'm sorry to tell you but your body's outlived your brain""
He said, ""I know this doctor in New York son
And he'll fix you up right with a brand new one""
So the head doctor met me when I stepped down off the train
He said, ""We had this bank robber killed last night
His body's shot but his brain's alright
I'll give you a transplant boy, and it'll be okay""
I got my new brain in and I was feeling great
I went right back to Nashville with no headache
But something strange happened when I walked in the bank one day
[Chorus]
I said ""Stick 'em up everybody, I'm robbing this place
Drop all of your money in my guitar case
Don't nobody move and don't nobody reach for that door
A lady said, ""Why, you're Johnny Cash!""
I said, ""No ma'am, I'm the Manhattan Flash
And I am the best bank robber in New York""
[Verse 2]
Now the other night, Roy Acuff called me
He said, ""John, I'd like for you to do the Opry""
So I went out on the stage, but I couldn't sing
I got into half a verse of ""I Walk The Line""
And something snapped in that head of mine
I yelled, ""Stick 'em up! Gimme your money, your watches, and rings""
Well I called New York and talked to that brain quack
I said, ""Doc, I've got to have my old brain back""
He said, ""I'm sorry there Mr. Cash, but I can't do that""
He said, ""I put your brain in a chicken last Monday
He singing your songs and making lots of money
And I got him signed to a ten year recording contract""
Now friends, if you see me walking down the street
Remember what you see ain't necessarily me
And if I try to hold you up, don't pay me no mind
But when you got ten bucks that you can blow
You ought to catch that Johnny Chicken Show
He's doin' fairs and concert dates all up and down the line

[Chorus]
I said ""Stick 'em up everybody, I'm robbing this place
Drop all of your money in my guitar case
Don't nobody move and don't nobody reach for that door
A lady said, ""Why, you're Johnny Cash!""
I said, ""No ma'am, I'm the Manhattan Flash
And I am the best bank robber in New York""

[Outro]
Well, I don't pay any income tax
You don't pay tax on money you steal
But you ought to catch that Johnny Chicken Show
Chicken In Black
Mm..."
Johnny Cash,I Hung My Head,"[Verse 1: Johnny Cash]
Early one morning
With time to kill
I borrowed Jebb's rifle
And sat on the hill
I saw a lone rider
Crossing the plain
I drew a bead on him
To practice my aim
My brother's rifle
Went off in my hand
A shot rang out
Across the land
The horse, he kept running
The rider was dead

[Chorus: Johnny Cash]
I hung my head
I hung my head

[Verse 2: Johnny Cash]
I set off running
To wake from the dream
My brother's rifle
Went into the sheen
I kept on running
Into the south lands
That's where they found me
My head in my hands
The sheriff, he asked me
""Why had I run?""
And then it came to me
Just what I had done
And all for no reason
Just one piece of lead

[Chorus: Johnny Cash]
I hung my head
I hung my head

[Verse 3: Johnny Cash]
Here in the courthouse
The whole town was there
I see the judge
High up in his chair
""Explain to the courtroom
What went through your mind
And we'll ask the jury
What verdict they find""
I felt the power
Of death over life
I orphaned his children
I widowed his wife
I begged their forgiveness
I wish I was dead

[Chorus: Johnny Cash]
I hung my head
I hung my head
I hung my head
I hung my

[Verse 4: Johnny Cash]
Early one morning
With time to kill
I see the gallows
Up on the hill
And out in the distance
A trick of the brain
I see a lone rider
Crossing the plain
And he'd come to fetch me
To see what they'd done
And we'll ride together
To kingdom come
I pray for God's mercy
For soon I'll be dead

[Chorus: Johnny Cash]
I hung my head
I hung my head
I hung my head
I hung my head"
Johnny Cash,One Piece at a Time,"[Verse 1]
Well, I left Kentucky back in '49
And went to Detroit, working on assembly line
The first year, they had me putting wheels on Cadillacs
Every day, I'd watch them beauties roll by
And sometimes, I'd hang my head and cry
'Cause I always wanted me one that was long and black
One day, I devised myself a plan
That should be the envy of most any man
I'd sneak it out of there in a lunchbox in my hand
Now, getting caught meant getting fired
But I figured I'd have it all by the time I retired
I'd have me a car worth at least a hundred grand

[Chorus]
I'd get it one piece at a time
And it wouldn't cost me a dime
You'd know it's me when I come through your town
I'm gonna ride around in style
I'm gonna drive everybody wild
'Cause I'll have the only one there is around

[Verse 2]
So the very next day, when I punched in
With my big lunchbox and with help from my friend
I left that day with a lunchbox full of gears
I've never considered myself a thief
But GM wouldn't miss just one little piece
Especially if I strung it out over several years
The first day, I got me a fuel pump
And the next day, I got me an engine and a trunk
Then I got me a transmission and all the chrome
The little things I could get in my big lunchbox
Like nuts and bolts and all four shocks
But the big stuff we snuck out in my buddy's mobile home
Now, up to now, my plan went alright
'Til we tried to put it all together one night
And that's when we noticed that something was definitely wrong
The transmission was a '53
And the motor turned out to be a '73
And when we tried to put in the bolts, all the holes were gone
So we drilled it out so that it would fit
And with a little bit of help from an adaptor kit
We had that engine running just like a song
Now the headlights, they was another sight
We had two on the left and one on the right
But when we pulled out the switch, all three of 'em come on
The back end looked kind of funny too
But we put it together and when we got through
Well, that's when we noticed that we only had one tail fin
About that time my wife walked out
And I could see in her eyes that she had her doubts
But she opened the door and said, ""Honey, take me for a spin""
So we drove up town just to get the tags
And I headed her right on down main drag
I could hear everybody laughing for blocks around
But up there at the courthouse, they didn't laugh
'Cause to type it up, it took the whole staff
And when they got through, the title weighed sixty pounds

[Chorus]
I got it one piece at a time
And it didn't cost me a dime
You'll know it's me when I come through your town
I'm gonna ride around in style
I'm gonna drive everybody wild
'Cause I'll have the only one there is around

[Outro]
Uh, yeah, Red Ryder?
This is the Cotton Mouth in the Psycho-Billy Cadillac, come on
Huh? This is the Cotton Mouth
And negatory on the cost of this machine, there, Red Ryder
You might say I went right up to the factory and picked it up
It's cheaper that way
Uh, what model is it?
Well, it's a '49, '50, '51, '52, '53, '54, '55, '56, '57, '58, '59 automobile
It's a '60, '61, '62, '63, '64, '65, '66, '67, '68, '69, '70 automobile"
Johnny Cash,If I Were a Carpenter,"[Verse 1: Johnny Cash, June Carter Cash]
If I were a carpenter
And you were a lady
Would you marry me anyway?
Would you have my baby?
If you were a carpenter
And I were a lady
I'd marry you anyway
I'd have your baby
If a tinker was my trade
Would I still find you?
I'd be carrying the pots you made
Following behind you

[Chorus: Johnny Cash & June Carter Cash, Johnny Cash]
Save your love through loneliness
Save your love through sorrow
I gave you my onliness
Give me your tomorrow

[Verse 2: Johnny Cash, June Carter Cash]
If I were a miller
At a mill wheel grinding
Would you miss your color blouse
And your soft shoe shining?
If you were a miller
At a mill wheel grinding
I'd not miss my color blouse
And my soft shoe shining

[Chorus: Johnny Cash & June Carter Cash, Johnny Cash]
Save your love through loneliness
Save your love through sorrow
I gave you my onliness
Give me your tomorrow

[Verse 3: Johnny Cash, June Carter Cash]
If I worked my hands in wood
Would you still love me?
I'd answered you, ""Yes I would""
And would you not be above me
If I were a carpenter
And you were a lady
I'd marry you anyway
I'd have your baby

[Chorus: Johnny Cash & June Carter Cash, Johnny Cash]
Save your love through loneliness
Save your love through sorrow
I gave you my onliness
Give me your tomorrow"
Johnny Cash,Heart of Gold,"I want to live
I want to give
I've been a miner
For a heart of gold
It's these expressions
I never give
That keeps me searching
For a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
Keeps me searching
For a heart of gold
And I'm getting old

I've been to Hollywood
I've been to Redwood
I crossed the ocean
For a heart of gold
I've been in my mind
It's such a fine line
That keeps me searching
For a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
That keeps me searching
For a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
For a heart of gold

You keep me searching
For a heart of gold
I've been a miner
For a heart of gold
And I'm getting old"

Willie Nelson,Cruel World,"[Chorus]
Cruel, cruel world, must I go on?
Cruel, cruel world, I'm moving on
I've been living too fast
And I've been living too wrong
Cruel, cruel world, I'm gone

[Verse 1]
This big ol' world sure got me running 'round
I heard a voice that said, ""Just settle down""
And with the moonlight as my guide
And with this feeling deep inside
I know now that I am homeward bound

[Chorus]
Cruel, cruel world, must I go on?
Cruel, cruel world, I'm moving on
I've been living too fast
And I've been living too wrong

I have seen so much pain
Now I see into the eyes of a girl
No more, no more, cruel world

I've been living too fast
And I've been living too wrong

Dusty trail, saw vapor light
Was it a mirage? I don't know, but it seemed right
I felt mission, I felt trust
I knew then that I must
Must go to her from this cruel world

Cruel, cruel world, I'm moving on

Willie Nelson,Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain,"[Verse]
In the twilight glow I see them
Blue eyes crying in the rain
When we kissed goodbye and parted
I knew we'd never meet again
Love is like a dying ember
And only memories remain
And through the ages I'll remember
Blue eyes crying in the rain
Some day when we meet up yonder
We'll stroll hand-in-hand again
In a land that knows no parting
Blue eyes crying in the rain

Now my hair has turned to silver
All my life I've loved in vain
I can see her star in heaven
Blue eyes crying in the rain"
Willie Nelson,I’m My Own Grandpa,"[Verse 1]
Now, many, many years ago when I was twenty-three
I was married to a widow who was pretty as could be
This widow had a grown-up daughter, had hair of red
My father fell in love with her and soon the two were wed
This made my dad my son-in-law and changed my very life
My daughter was my mother 'cause she was my father's wife
To complicate the matter, even though it brought me joy
I soon became the father of a bouncing baby boy
My little baby then became the brother-in-law to Dad
And so became my uncle though it made me very sad
For if he was my uncle, that also made him the brother
Of the widow's grown-up daughter who of course was my step-mother

[Chorus]
I'm my own grandpa
I'm my own grandpa
It sounds funny, I know, but it really is so
For I'm my own grandpa

[Verse 2]
My father's wife then had a son that kept him on the run
And he became my grandchild for he was my daughter's son
My wife is now my mother's mother and it makes me blue
Because she is my wife, she's my grandmother too

[Chorus]
I'm my own grandpa
I'm my own grandpa
It sounds funny, I know, but it really is so
I'm my own grandpa

[Verse 3]
Now, if my wife is my grandmother, then I'm her grandchild
And every time I think of it, it nearly drives me wild
For now I have become the strangest case you ever saw
As husband of my grandmother, I am my own grandpa

[Chorus]
I'm my own grandpa
I'm my own grandpa
It sounds funny, I know, but it really is so
For I'm my own grandpa

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I'm my own grandpa
I'm my own grandpa
It sounds funny, I know, but it really is so
I'm my own grandpa"
Willie Nelson,Always on My Mind,"[Verse 1]
Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
If I made you feel second best
Girl, I'm sorry I was blind

[Chorus]
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

[Verse 2]
And maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you
I'm so happy that you're mine
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time

[Chorus]
And you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

[Bridge]
Tell me, tell me that your
Sweet love hasn't died
And give me
Give me one more chance
To keep you satisfied
Keep you satisfied

[Outro]
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind"
Willie Nelson,Seven Spanish Angels,"[Verse 1: Ray Charles]
He looked down into her brown eyes
And said ""Say a prayer for me""
She threw her arms around him
Whispered ""God will keep us free""
They could hear the riders coming
He said ""This is my last fight
If they take me back to Texas
They won't take me back alive""

[Chorus: Ray Charles]
There were seven Spanish angels
At the altar of the sun
They were praying for the lovers
In the valley of the gun
When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared
There was thunder from the throne
And seven Spanish angels
Took another angel home

[Verse 2: Willie Nelson]
She reached down and picked the gun up
That lay smoking in his hand
She said, ""Father please forgive me
I can't make it without my man""
And she knew the gun was empty
And she knew she couldn't win
Her final prayer was answered
When the rifles fired again

[Chorus: Willie Nelson]
There were seven Spanish angels
At the altar of the sun
They were praying for the lovers
In the valley of the gun
When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared
There was thunder from the throne
And seven Spanish angels
Took another angel home

[Chorus: Ray Charles]
There were seven Spanish angels
At the alter of the sun
They were praying for the lovers
In the valley of the gun
When the battle stopped
And the smoke cleared
There was thunder from the throne
And seven Spanish angels
Took another angel home

[Interlude: Ray Charles]
Come on Willie, help me with this thing

[Chorus: Both]
There were seven Spanish angels
At the Altar of the Sun (Oh I believe)
They were praying for the lovers (Yeah they was)
In the Valley of the Gun (Well, well, well)
When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared
There was thunder from the throne (Oh, yeah)
And seven Spanish angels
Took another Angel home"
Willie Nelson,Hands on the Wheel,"[Verse 1]
At a time when the world seems to be spinnin'
Hopelessly out of control
There's deceivers, and believers, and old in-betweeners
That seem to have no place to go

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, it's the same old song, it's right and it's wrong
And living is just something that I do
And with no place to hide, I looked in your eyes
And I found myself in you

[Chorus]
I looked to the stars
Tried all of the bars
And I've nearly gone up in smoke
Now my hand's on the wheel
I've something that's real
And I feel like I'm going home

[Verse 2]
And in the shade of an oak down by the river
Sat an old man and a boy
Setting sail, spinning tales and fishing for whales
With a lady they both enjoy

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, it's the same damn tune
It's the man in the moon
It's the way that I feel about you
And with no place to hide
I looked in your eyes
And I found myself in you

[Chorus]
And I looked to the stars
Tried all of the bars
And I've nearly gone up in smoke
Now my hand's on the wheel
I've something that's real
And I feel like I'm going home"
Willie Nelson,Buddy,"[Chorus]
Laugh with me, buddy, jest with me, buddy
Don't let her get the best of me, buddy
Don't ever let me start feeling lonely

[Verse 1]
If I ever needed you, buddy
You know now I really do, buddy
Don't ever let me start feeling lonely

[Verse 2]
I cry at the least, little thing, buddy
And I'll die if you mention her name, buddy

[Chorus]
Talk to me, buddy, stay with me, buddy
Let's don't let her get away with it, buddy
Don't ever let me start feeling lonely

[Verse 3]
Let's talk about things as they were, buddy
Before I got mixed up with her, buddy

[Chorus]
Laugh with me, buddy, jest with me, buddy
Let's don't let her get the best of me, buddy
Don't ever let me start feeling lonely"
Willie Nelson,Cowboys Are Frequently Secretly Fond of Each Other,"Well, there's many a strange impulse out on the plains of West Texas
There's many a young boy who feels things he can't comprehend
And a small town don't like it when somebody falls between sexes
No, a small town don't like it when a cowboy has feelings for men

And I believe to my soul that inside every man there's the feminine
And inside every lady there's a deep manly voice loud and clear
Well, a cowboy may brag about things that he's done with his women
But the ones who brag loudest are the ones that are most likely queer

Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other
Say, what do you think all them saddles and boots was about?
And there's many a cowboy who don't understand the way that he feels for his brother
And inside every cowboy there's a lady that'd love to slip out

And there's always somebody who says what the others just whisper
And mostly that someone's the first one to get shot down dead
So when you talk to a cowboy don't treat him like he was a sister
You can't fuck with a lady that's sleepin' in each cowboy's head

Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other
What did you think all them saddles and boots was about?
And there's many a cowboy who don't understand the way that he feels for his brother
And inside every lady there's a cowboy who wants to come out
And inside every cowboy there's a lady that'd love to slip out"
Willie Nelson,Shotgun Willie,"[Chorus]
Shotgun Willie sits around in his underwear
Biting on a bullet, pulling out all of his hair
Now, Shotgun Willie's got all of his family there

[Verse 1]
Well, you can't make a record if you ain't got nothing to say
You can't make a record if you ain't got nothing to say
You can't play music if you don't know nothing to play

[Chorus]
Shotgun Willie sits around in his underwear
Biting on a bullet and pulling out all of his hair
Shotgun Willie's got all of his family there

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Now, John T. Floores was a-working for the Ku Klux Klan
At six foot five, John T. was a hell of a man
Made a lot of money selling sheets on the family plan

[Chorus]
Shotgun Willie sits around in his underwear
Biting on a bullet and pulling out all of his hair
Shotgun Willie's got all of his family there"
Willie Nelson,Something You Get Through,"When you lose the one you love
You think your world has ended
You think your world will be a waste of life
Without them in it
You feel there's no way to go on
Life is just a sad, sad song
But love is bigger than us all
The end is not the end at all

It's not somethin' you get over
But it's somethin' you get through
It's not ours to be taken
It's just a thing we get to do
Life goes on and on
And when it's gone
It lives in someone new
It's not somethin' you get over
But it's somethin' you get through

It's not somethin' you get over
But it's somethin' you get through
It's not ours to be taken
It's just a thing we get to do

Life goes on and on
And when it's gone
It lives in someone new
It's not somethin' you get over
But it's somethin' you get through
It's not somethin' you get over
But it's somethin' you get through"
Willie Nelson,Angel Flying Too Close to the Ground,"[Verse 1]
If you had not have fallen then I would not have found you
Angel flying too close to the ground
And I patched up your broken wing and hung around a while
Trying to keep your spirits up and your fever down

[Verse 2]
I knew someday that you would fly away
For love's the greatest healer to be found
So leave me if you need to, I will still remember
Angel flying too close to the ground

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Fly on, fly on past the speed of sound
I'd rather see you up than see you down
So leave me if you need to, I will still remember
Angel flying too close to the ground

[Tag]
Leave me if you need to, I will still remember
Angel flying too close to the ground"
Willie Nelson,Red Headed Stranger,"[Verse 1]
The red-headed stranger from Blue Rock, Montana
Rode into town one day
And under his knees was a raging black stallion
And walking behind was a bay
The red-headed stranger had eyes like thunder
And his lips, they were sad and tight
His little lost love lay asleep on the hillside
And his heart was heavy as night

[Chorus]
Don't cross him, don't boss him
He's wild in his sorrow
He's riding and hiding his pain
Don't fight him, don't spite him
Just wait 'til tomorrow
Maybe he'll ride on again

[Verse 2]
A yellow-haired lady leaned out of her window
And watched as he passed her way
She drew back in fear at the sight of the stallion
But cast greedy eyes on the bay
But how could she know that this dancing bay pony
Meant more to him than life?
For this was the horse that his little lost darling
Had ridden when she was his wife

[Chorus]
Don't cross him, don't boss him
He's wild in his sorrow
He's riding and hiding his pain
Don't fight him, don't spite him
Just wait till tomorrow
Maybe he'll ride on again

[Verse 3]
The yellow-haired lady came down to the tavern
And looked up the stranger there
He bought her a drink and he gave her some money
He just didn't seem to care
She followed him out as he saddled his stallion
And laughed as she grabbed at the bay
He shot her so quick, they had no time to warn her
She never heard anyone say

[Chorus]
""Don't cross him, don't boss him
""He's wild in his sorrow
""He's riding and hiding his pain
""Don't fight him, don't spite him
""Just wait 'til tomorrow
""Maybe he'll ride on again""

[Verse 4]
The yellow-haired lady was buried at sunset
The stranger went free, of course
For you can't hang a man for killing a woman
Who's trying to steal your horse
This is the tale of the red headed stranger
And if he should pass your way
Stay out of the path of the raging black stallion
And don't lay a hand on the bay

[Chorus]
Don't cross him, don't boss him
He's wild in his sorrow
He's riding and hiding his pain
Don't fight him, don't spite him
Just wait till tomorrow
Maybe he'll ride on again"
Willie Nelson,Stardust,"[Verse]
Sometimes I wonder why I spend
The lonely nights dreaming of a song
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song
Beside the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale tells his fairy tale
A paradise where roses bloom

[Chorus]
Though I dream in vain
In my heart there always will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain
Though I dream in vain
In my heart there always will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain
Though I dream in vain
In my heart there always will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain"
Willie Nelson,Time of the Preacher,"[Verse]
It was the time of the preacher
When the story began
With the choice of a lady
And the love of a man
How he loved her so dearly
He went out of his mind
When she left him for someone
That she'd left behind

He cried like a baby
He screamed like a panther
In the middle of the night
And he saddled his pony
He went for a ride
It was the time of the preacher
In the year of '01
Now the preachin' is over
And the lesson's begun

[Spanish guitar outro]"
Willie Nelson,Whiskey River,"[Chorus]
Whiskey River take my mind
Don't let her mem'ry torture me
Whiskey River don't run dry
You're all I've got, take care of me

[Chorus]
Whiskey River take my mind
Don't let her mem'ry torture me
Whiskey River don't run dry
You're all I've got, take care of me

I'm drowning in a whiskey river
Bathing my mem'ried mind
In the wetness of its soul
Feeling the amber current
Flowin' from my mind
And leaving a heart you left so cold

Whiskey River take my mind
Don't let her mem'ry torture me
Whiskey River don't run dry
You're all I've got, take care of me

Willie Nelson,Crazy,"[Verse 1]
I'm crazy, crazy for feeling so lonely
I'm crazy, crazy for feeling so blue

[Verse 2]
I knew that you'd love me as long as you wanted
And then someday, you'd leave me for somebody new

[Verse 3]
Worry, why do I let myself worry?
Wondering, ""What in the world did I do?""

[Chorus]
I'm crazy for thinking that my love could hold you
I'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying
And I'm crazy for loving you
I'm crazy for thinking that my love could hold you
I'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying
And I'm crazy for loving you"
Willie Nelson,Funny How Time Slips Away,"[Verse 1]
Well, hello there
My, it's been a long, long time
How am I doing?
Oh, I guess that I'm doing fine
It's been so long now
But it seems now that it was only yesterday
Gee, ain't it funny
How time slips away?

[Verse 2]
How's your new love?
I hope that he's doing fine
I heard you told him
That you'd love him 'til the end of time
Now that's the same thing that you told me
Seems like just the other day
Gee, ain't it funny
How time slips away?

[Verse 3]
I gotta go now
I guess I'll see you around
Don't know when though
Never know when I'll be back in town
But remember what I tell you
In time, you're gonna pay
And it's surprising how time slips away"
Willie Nelson,Pretty Paper,"[Chorus]
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue
Wrap your presents to your darling from you
Pretty pencils to write I love you
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue

[Verse 1]
Crowded streets, busy feet hustle by you
Downtown shoppers Christmas is nigh
There he sits all alone on the sidewalk
Hoping that you won't pass him by

[Verse 2]
Should you stop? Better not much too busy
You better hurry, my how time does fly
And in the distance the ringing of laughter
And in the midst of the laughter he cries

[Chorus]
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue
Wrap your presents to your darling from you
Pretty pencils to write I love you
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue

[Outro]
Oh, oh, pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue"
Willie Nelson,Roll Me Up,"[Chorus]
Roll me up and smoke me when I die
And if anyone don't like it, just look 'em in the eye
I didn't come here, and I ain't leaving, so don't sit around and cry
Just roll me up and smoke me when I die

[Verse 1]
Now you won't see no sad and teary eyes
When I get my wings and it's my time to fly
Call my friends and tell 'em there's a party, come on by
Now just roll me up and smoke me when I die

[Chorus]
Roll me up and smoke me when I die
And if anyone don't like it, just look 'em in the eye
I didn't come here, and I ain't leaving, so don't sit around and cry
A-just roll me up and smoke me when I die

[Verse 2]
When I'd go, I'll have been here long enough
So sing and tell more jokes and dance and stuff
Just keep the music playing, that'll be a good goodbye
Roll me up and smoke me when I die

[Chorus]
Roll me up and smoke me when I die
And if anyone don't like it, just look 'em in the eye
I didn't come here, and I ain't leaving, so don't sit around and cry
Just roll me up and smoke me when I die

[Verse 3]
Hey, take me out and build a roaring fire
Roll me in the flames for about an hour
Then take me out and twist me up, and point me towards the sky
And roll me up and smoke me when I die

And if anyone don't like it, just look 'em in the eye

Willie Nelson,The Party’s Over,"[Chorus]
Turn out the lights, the party's over
They say that all good things must end
Call it a night, the party's over
And tomorrow starts the same old thing again

[Verse 1]
What a crazy, crazy party, never seen so many people
Laughing, dancing, look at you, you're having fun
But look at me I'm almost crying
But that don't keep her love from dying
Misery, 'cause for me the party's over

[Chorus]
Turn out the lights, the party's over
They say that all good things must end
Call it a night, the party's over
And tomorrow starts the same old thing again

[Verse 2]
Once I had a love undying, I didn't keep it wasn't trying
Life for me was just one party and then another
I broke her heart so many times, had to have my party wife
And then one night she said, ""Sweetheart, the party's over""

[Chorus]
Turn out the lights, the party's over
They say that all good things must end
Call it a night, the party's over
And tomorrow starts the same old thing again

And tomorrow starts the same old thing again"
Willie Nelson,Blue Skies,"[Chorus]
Blue skies smiling at me
Nothing but blue skies do I see
Blue birds singing a song
Nothing but blue skies from now on

[Verse]
I never saw the sun shining so bright
Never saw things going so right
Noticing the days hurrying by
When you're in love, my how they fly by
Blue days, all of them gone
Nothing but blue skies from now on

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Blue skies smiling at me
Nothing but blue skies do I see
Blue days, all of them gone
Nothing but blue skies from now on
Blue skies smiling at me
Nothing but blue skies do I see

Nothing but blue skies from now on
Blue skies smiling at me
Nothing but blue skies do I see
Blue days, all of them gone
Nothing but blue skies from now on"
Willie Nelson,Me and Paul,"[Pre-Chorus: Willie Nelson]
It's been rough and rocky traveling
But I'm finally standing upright on the ground
After taking several readings
I'm surprised to find my mind's still fairly sound

[Chorus: Willie Nelson]
Guess Nashville was the roughest
But I know I've said the same about them all
We received our education
In the cities of the nation, me and Paul

[Verse 1: Willie Nelson]
Almost busted in Laredo
But for reasons that I'd rather not disclose
But if you're staying in a motel there and leave
Just don't leave nothing in your clothes
And at the airport in Milwaukee
They refused to let us board the plane at all
They said we looked suspicious
But I believe they like to pick on me and Paul

[Pre-Chorus: Willie Nelson]
Well, it's been rough and rocky traveling
But I'm finally standing upright on the ground
And after taking several readings
I'm surprised to find my mind's still fairly sound

[Chorus: Willie Nelson]
I guess Nashville was the roughest
But I know I've said the same about them all
We received our education
In the cities of the nation, me and Paul

[Verse 2: Willie Nelson]
On a package show in Buffalo
With us and Kitty Wells and Charlie Pride
The show was long and we're just sitting there
And we'd come to play and not just for the ride
Well, we drank a lot of whiskey
So I don't know if we went on that night at all
But I don't think they even missed us
I guess Buffalo ain't geared for me and Paul

[Pre-Chorus: Willie Nelson]
Well, it's been rough and rocky traveling
But I'm finally standing upright on the ground
After taking several readings
I'm surprised to find my mind's still fairly sound

[Chorus: Willie Nelson]
I guess Nashville was the roughest
But I know I've said the same about them all
We received our education
In the cities of the nation, me and Paul"
Willie Nelson,It’s Hard to Be Humble,"[Chorus]
Oh Lord, it's hard to be humble
When you're perfect in every way
I can't wait to look in the mirror
'Cause I get better lookin' each day
To know me is to love me
I must be a hell of a man
Oh Lord, it's hard to be humble
But I'm doin' the best that I can

[Verse 1]
I used to have me a girlfriend
But I guess that she couldn't compete
With all of them love-starved women
Who keep clamoring around at my feet
Well I probably could find me another
But I guess they're all in awe of me (Oh man)
Who cares? I'll never get lonesome
'Cause I treasure my own company

[Chorus]
Oh Lord, it's hard to be humble
When you're perfect in every way
I can't wait to look in the mirror
'Cause I get better lookin' each day
To know me is to love me
I must be one hell of a man
Oh Lord, it's hard to be humble
But I'm doin' the best that we can

[Verse 2]
I guess you could say I'm a loner (Yeah)
A cowboy outlaw, tough and proud
I could have a lot of friends if I wanted
But then I wouldn't stand out from the crowd
Some folks say that I'm egotistical
Hell, I don't even know what that means
I guess it has something to do with the way
That I fill out my skin-tight blue jeans

[Chorus]
Oh Lord, it's hard to be humble
When you're perfect in every way
I can't wait to look in the mirror
But I get better lookin' each day
To know me is to love me
I must be one hell of a man
Oh Lord, it's hard to be humble
But I'm doin' the best that we can
Lord, it's hard to be humble
But I'm doin' the best that I can"
Willie Nelson,Just Breathe,"[Verse 1]
Yes, I understand that every life must end, uh-huh
As we sit alone, I know someday we must go, uh-huh
Oh, I'm a lucky man to count on both hands the ones I love
Some folks just have one, yeah well, others, they've got none uh-huh

[Refrain]
Stay with me, oh
Let's just breathe

[Verse 2]
Practiced are my sins, never gonna let you win, uh-huh
Under everything, just another human being, uh-huh
And I don't want to hurt, there's so much in this world
To make me believe

[Refrain]
Stay with me
You're all I see

[Chorus]
Did I say that I need you?
Did I say that I want you?
Or if I didn't, I'm a fool, you see
No one knows this more than me
But I come clean

[Verse 3]
I wonder every day, as I look upon your face, uh-huh
Everything you gave and nothing you would take, uh-huh
Nothing you would take
Everything you gave

[Chorus]
Did I say that I need you? Oh-oh
Did I say that I want you?
Oh, if I didn't, I'm a fool, you see
No one knows this more than me
As I come clean, oh

[Outro]
Nothing you would take
Everything you gave
Love you 'til I die
Meet you on the other side"
Loretta Lynn,The Pill,"You wined me and dined me when I was your girl
Promised if I'd be your wife, you'd show me the world
But all I've seen of this old world is a bed and a doctor bill
I'm tearing down your brooder house 'cause now I've got the pill

All these years, I've stayed at home while you had all your fun
And every year that's gone by, another baby's come
There's gonna be some changes made right here on Nursery Hill
You've set this chicken your last time 'cause now I've got the pill

This old maternity dress I've got is going in the garbage
The clothes I'm wearing from now on won't take up so much yardage
Miniskirts, hot pants, and a few little fancy frills
Yeah, I'm making up for all those years since I've got the pill

I'm tired of all your crowing how you and your hens play
While holding a couple in my arms, another is on the way
This chicken's done tore up her nest and I'm ready to make a deal
And you can't afford to turn it down 'cause you know I've got the pill

This incubator is over-used because you've kept it filled
But feeling good comes easy now since I've got the pill
It's getting dark, it's roosting time, tonight's too good to be real
Aw, but Daddy don't you worry none 'cause Mama's got the pill
Oh, Daddy don't you worry none 'cause Mama's got the pill"
Loretta Lynn,Coal Miner’s Daughter,"[Verse 1]
Well, I was born the coal miner's daughter
In a cabin on a hill in Butcher Holler
We were poor, but we had love
That's the one thing that Daddy made sure of
He shoveled coal to make a poor man's dollar

[Verse 2]
My Daddy worked all night in the Van Lear coal mines
All day long in the field hoeing corn
Mommy rocked the babies at night
And read the Bible by the coal-oil light
And everything would start all over come break of morn'

[Verse 3]
Daddy loved and raised eight kids on a miner's pay
Mommy scrubbed our clothes on a washboard every day
Why, I've seen her fingers bleed
To complain, there was no need
She's smiled in Mommy's understanding way

[Verse 4]
In the summertime, we didn't have shoes to wear
But in the wintertime, we'd all get a brand new pair
From a mail-order catalog
Money made from selling a hog
Daddy always managed to get the money somewhere

[Verse 5]
Yeah, I'm proud to be a coal miner's daughter
I remember well the well where I drew water
The work we done was hard
At night, we'd sleep 'cause we were tired
I never thought of ever leaving Butcher Holler

[Verse 6]
Well, a lot of things have changed since way back then
And it's so good to be back home again
Not much left but the floor
Nothing lives here anymore
Except the memories of a coal miner's daughter"
Loretta Lynn,You Ain’t Woman Enough (To Take My Man),"[Verse 1]
You've come to tell me something you say I ought to know
That he don't love me anymore and I'll have to let him go
You say you're gonna take him, oh but I don't think you can
'Cause you ain't woman enough to take my man

[Chorus]
Women like you, they're a dime a dozen
You can buy 'em anywhere
For you to get to him, I'd have to move over
And I'm gonna stand right here
It'll be over my dead body, so get out while you can
'Cause you ain't woman enough to take my man

[Verse 2]
Sometimes a man's caught lookin' at things that he don't need
He took a second look at you, but he's in love with me
Well I don't know where that leaves you, but I know where I stand
And you ain't woman enough to take my man

[Chorus]
Women like you, they're a dime a dozen
You can buy 'em anywhere
For you to get to him, I'd have to move over
And I'm gonna stand right here
It'll be over my dead body, so get out while you can
'Cause you ain't woman enough to take my man

[Refrain]
No, you ain't woman enough to take my man"
Loretta Lynn,Fist City,"[Verse 1]
You've been making your brags around town
That you've been a-loving my man
But the man I love, when he picks up trash
He puts it in a garbage can
And that's what you look like to me
And what I see is a pity
You'd better close your face and stay out of my way
If you don't wanna go to Fist City

[Chorus]
If you don't wanna go to Fist City
You'd better detour around my town
'Cause I'll grab you by the hair of your head
And I'll lift you off of the ground
I'm not a-sayin' my baby is a saint, 'cause he ain't
And that he won't cat around with a kitty
I'm here to tell you, gal, to lay off of my man
If you don't wanna go to Fist City

[Verse 2]
Come on and tell me what you told my friends
If you think you're brave enough
And I'll show you what a real woman is
Since you think you're hot stuff
You'll bite off more than you can chew
If you get too cute or witty
You better move your feet, if you don't wanna eat
A meal that's called Fist City

[Chorus]
If you don't wanna go to Fist City
You'd better detour around my town
'Cause I'll grab you by the hair of your head
And I'll lift you off of the ground
I'm not a-sayin' my baby is a saint, 'cause he ain't
And that he won't cat around with a kitty
I'm here to tell you, gal, to lay off of my man
If you don't wanna go to Fist City

[Outro]
I'm here to tell you, gal, to lay off of my man
If you don't wanna go to Fist City"
Loretta Lynn,Precious Memories,"Precious memories, unseen angels
Sent from somewhere to my soul
How they linger, ever near me
And the sacred scenes unfold

Precious memories, how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight
Precious, sacred scenes unfold

Precious father, loving mother
Fly across the lonely years
And old home scenes of my childhood
In fond memory appear

In the stillness of the midnight
Echoes from the past I hear
Old-time singing, gladness bringing
From that lovely land somewhere

I remember mother praying
Father, too, on bended knee
Sun is sinking, shadows falling
But their prayers still follow me

As I travel on life's pathway
Know not what the years may hold
As I ponder, hope grows fonder
Precious memories flood my soul"
Loretta Lynn,Lay Me Down,"[Verse 1: Loretta Lynn]
I've raised my head and set my sail
In the eye of a storm and the belly of a whale
My spirit stood on solid ground
I'll be at peace when they lay me down

[Verse 2: Willie Nelson]
When I was a child, I cried
Until my needs were satisfied
My needs have grown up, pound for pound
I'll be at peace when they lay me down

[Chorus: Loretta Lynn & Willie Nelson]
When they lay me down someday
My soul will rise and fly away
This old world will turn around
I'll be at peace when they lay me down

[Verse 3: Loretta Lynn & Willie Nelson]
This life isn't fair, it seems
It's filled with tears and broken dreams
There are no tears where I am bound
And I'll be at peace when they lay me down

[Chorus: Loretta Lynn & Willie Nelson]
When they lay me down someday
My soul will rise and fly away
This old world will turn around
I'll be at peace when they lay me down
When they lay me down someday
My soul will rise and fly away
This old world will turn around
I'll be at peace when they lay me down

[Outro]
When I was a child, I cried"
Loretta Lynn,Don’t Come Home a Drinkin’,"[Verse 1]
Well you thought I'd be waiting up
When you came home last night
You'd been out with all the boys
And you ended up half-tight
Liquor and love, they just don't mix
Leave a bottle or me behind
And don't come home a-drinkin'
With lovin' on your mind

[Chorus]
No, don't come home a-drinkin'
With lovin' on your mind
Just stay out there on the town
And see what you can find
'Cause if you want that kind of love
Well, you don't need none of mine
So don't come home a-drinkin'
With lovin' on your mind

[Verse 2]
You never take me anywhere
Because you're always gone
Many a night, I've laid awake
And cried here all alone
And you come in a-kissin' on me
It happens every time
So don't come home a-drinkin'
With lovin' on your mind

[Chorus]
No, don't come home a-drinkin'
With lovin' on your mind
Just stay out there on the town
And see what you can find
'Cause if you want that kind of love
Well, you don't need none of mine
So don't come home a-drinkin'
With lovin' on your mind

[Outro]
No, don't come home a-drinkin'
With lovin' on your mind"
Loretta Lynn,One’s on the Way,"[Verse 1]
They say to have her hair done, Liz flies all the way to France
And Jackie's seen in a discotheque doing a brand new dance
And the White House social season should be glittering and gay
But here in Topeka, the rain is a-falling
The faucet is a-dripping and the kids are a-bawling
One of them a-toddling and one is a-crawling
And one's on the way

[Verse 2]
I'm glad that Raquel Welch just signed a million dollar pact
And Debbie's out in Vegas, working up a brand new act
While the TV's showing Newlyweds, a real fun game to play
But here in Topeka, the screen door's a-banging
The coffee's boiling over and the wash needs a-hanging
One wants a cookie and one wants a changing
And one's on the way

[Bridge]
Now what was I doing? Jimmy, get away from there, darn, there goes the phone
Hello, honey, what's that you say? You're bringing a few old Army buddies home?
You're calling from a bar? Get away from there
No, not you, honey, I was talkin' to the baby
Wait a minute, honey, the doorbell
Honey, could you stop at the market and— hello? Hello?
Well, I'll be

[Verse 3]
The girls in New York City, they all march for women's lib
And Better Homes and Gardens shows the modern way to live
And the pill may change the world tomorrow, but meanwhile today
Here in Topeka, the flies are a-buzzing
The dog is a-barking and the floor needs a scrubbing
One needs a spanking and one needs a hugging
Lord, one's on the way

[Outro]
Oh, gee, I hope it ain't twins again"
Loretta Lynn,Everybody Wants to Go to Heaven,"Everybody wants to go to Heaven
But nobody wants to die

Once upon a time there lived a man
And his name was Hezekiah
He walked with God both day and night
But he didn't wanna die

He cried, ""Oh Lord, please let me live
Death is close, I know""
God smiled down on Hezekiah
And gave him fifteen years to go

Everybody wants to go to Heaven
But nobody wants to die
Lord, I wanna go to Heaven
But I don't wanna die

So I long for the day when I'll have new birth
Still I love livin' here on Earth
Everybody wants to go to Heaven
But nobody wants to die

When Jesus lived here on this Earth
He knew his father's plan
He knew that he must give his life
To save the soul of man

When Judas had betrayed him
Her father heard him cry
He was brave until his death
But he didn't wanna die

Everybody wants to go to Heaven
But nobody wants to die
Lord, I wanna go to Heaven
But I don't wanna die

So I long for the day when I'll have new birth
Still I love livin' here on Earth
Everybody wants to go to Heaven
But nobody wants to die

Everybody wants to go to Heaven
But nobody wants to die

Lord, I wanna go to Heaven
But I don't wanna die

So I long for the day when I'll have new birth
Still I love livin' here on Earth

Everybody wants to go to Heaven
But nobody wants to die
Everybody wants to go to Heaven
But nobody wants to die"
Loretta Lynn,Rated “X”,"[Verse 1]
Well, if you've been a married woman
And things didn't seem to work out
Divorce is the key to bein' loose and free
So you're gonna be talked about
Everybody knows that you've loved once
They think you'll love again
You can't have a male friend
When you're a has-been or a woman
You're rated X

[Chorus]
And if you're rated X, you're some kind of gold
Even men turnin' silver try to make
But I think it's wrong to judge every picture
If a cheap camera makes a mistake
And when your best friend's husband says to you
You've sure started lookin' good
You shoulda known he would, and he would if he could
And he will if you're rated X

[Verse 2]
Well, nobody knows where you're goin'
But they sure know where you've been
All they're thinkin' of is your experience of love
Oh, their minds eat up with sin
The women all look at you like you're bad
The men all hope you are
But if you go too far, you're gonna wear the scar
Of a woman rated X

[Chorus]
And if you're rated X, you're some kind of gold
That even men turnin' silver try to make
But I think it's wrong to judge every picture
If a cheap camera makes a mistake
And when your best friend's husband says to you
You've sure started lookin' good
You shoulda known he would, and he would if he could
And he will if you're rated X

[Outro]
Why, us women don't have a chance
'Cause if you've been married, you can't have no fun at all
No, you're rated X
No matter what you do, they're gonna talk about you
Look down their noses
I, I don't know what to think about it
Just give 'em somethin' to talk about, I guess"
Loretta Lynn,Dear Uncle Sam,"[Verse 1]
Dear, Uncle Sam
I know you're a busy man
And tonight, I write to you
Through tears with a tremblin' hand
My darlin' answered
When he got that call from you
You said you really need him
But you don't need him like I do

[Verse 2]
Don't misunderstand
I know he's fighting for our land
I really love my country
But I also love my man
He proudly wears the colors
Of the old red, white, and blue
While I wear a heartache
Since he left me for you

[Outro]
Dear, Uncle Sam
I just got your telegram
And I can't believe that this is me
Shakin' like I am
For it said, ""I'm sorry to inform you..."""
Loretta Lynn,"Portland, Oregon","[Verse 1-Loretta Lynn]
Well, Portland, Oregon and sloe gin fizz
If that ain't love, then tell me what is, uh-huh uh-huh
Well I lost my heart, it didn't take no time
But that ain't all, I lost my mind in Oregon

[Verse 2-Jack White & Loretta Lynn]
In a booth in the corner with the lights down low
I was moving in fast she was taking it slow, uh-huh uh-huh
Well, I looked at him and caught him looking at me
I knew right then, we were playing free in Oregon

[Verse 3-Jack White & Loretta Lynn]
Next day, we knew last night got drunk
But we loved enough for the both of us, uh-huh uh-huh
In the morning when the night had sobered up
It was much too late for the both of us in Oregon

[Verse 4-Loretta Lynn & Jack White]
Well, sloe gin fizz works mighty fast
When you drink it by the pitcher and not by the glass, uh-huh uh-huh
Hey bartender, before you close
Pour us one more drink and a pitcher to go

[Outro-Loretta Lynn & Jack White]
And a pitcher to go
And a pitcher to go
And a pitcher to go
And a pitcher to go
And a pitcher to go"
Loretta Lynn,Before I’m Over You,"[Verse 1]
I just can't get it through my head, you love another now instead
Can't make myself believe we're really through
I'm walkin' up and down the hall, talkin' to a silent wall
I'll lose my mind before I'm over you

[Chorus]
I think I've almost lost my mind, I think about you all the time
I'm going crazy, yes I know, and I don't have far to go
The way you treat me is a shame, but I'll keep loving you the same
I'll lose my mind before I'm over you

[Verse 2]
I keep your letters I should burn, I wear your ring I should return
But there's a million foolish things I do
It makes me cry, but you would laugh to know I kiss your photograph
I'll lose my mind before I'm over you

[Chorus]
I think I've almost lost my mind, I think about you all the time
I'm going crazy, yes I know, and I don't have far to go
The way you treat me is a shame, but I'll keep loving you the same
I'll lose my mind before I'm over you"
Loretta Lynn,Van Lear Rose,"[Verse 1]
One of my fondest memories
Was sittin' on my daddy's knee
Listenin' to the stories that he told
He'd pull out that old photograph
Like a treasured memory from the past
And say, ""Child, this here's the Van Lear Rose""

[Verse 2]
Oh how it would bring a smile
When he talked about her big blue eyes
And how her beauty ran down to her soul
She'd walk across the coal miner's yard
Them miners would yell loud and hard
And they'd dream of who would hold the Van Lear Rose

[Chorus]
She was the belle of Johnson County
Ohio River to Big Sandy
A beauty to behold
Like a diamond in the coal
All the miners, they would gather 'round
To talk about the man that came to town
Right under their nose
Stole the heart of the Van Lear Rose

[Verse 3]
Now the Van Lear Rose could've had her pick
And all the fellers figured rich
Until this poor boy caught her eye
His buddies would all laugh and say
""You're dreamin', boy, she'll never look your way
You'll never ever hold the Van Lear Rose""

[Chorus]
She was the belle of Johnson County
Ohio River to Big Sandy
A beauty to behold
Like a diamond in the coal
All the miners, they would gather 'round
To talk about the man that came to town
Right under their nose
Stole the heart of the Van Lear Rose

[Verse 4]
Then one night in mid-July
Underneath that old blue Kentucky sky
Well, that poor boy won that beauty's heart
Then my daddy would look at my mommy and smile
As he brushed the hair back from my eyes
And he'd say, ""Your mama, she's the Van Lear Rose""

[Chorus]
She was the belle of Johnson County
Ohio River to Big Sandy
A beauty to behold
Like a diamond in the coal
All the miners, they would gather 'round
To talk about the man that came to town
Right under their nose
Stole the heart of the Van Lear Rose

[Outro]
Right under their nose
Stole the heart of the Van Lear Rose"
Loretta Lynn,I’m a Honky Tonk Girl,"[Verse 1]
Ever since you left me, I've done nothing but wrong
Many nights I've laid awake and cried
We once were happy, my heart was in a whirl
But now I'm a honky tonk girl

[Chorus]
So turn that jukebox way up high
And fill my glass up while I cry
I've lost everything in this world
And now I'm a honky tonk girl

[Verse 2]
I just can't make a right with all of my wrongs
Every evening of my life seems so long
I'm sorry and ashamed for all these things you see
But losing him has made a fool of me

[Chorus]
So fill my glass up to the rim
To lose my memory of him
I've lost everything in this world
And now I'm a honky tonk girl"

We shall meet on that beautiful shore
In the sweet bye and bye
We shall meet on that beautiful shore"

Well a Momma go a tippy tippy toein' through the house

It's been a bawlin' and a squallin' and a kickin' on the wall
Well I guess it dropped it's little bottle maybe

[Verse 2]
Well Daddy come a runnin' with the water and a rag
Gonna need another little diaper maybe
No need a hesitatin' or a wonderin' and a waitin'

Is depending entirely on the baby

Momma sleep a little longer, but remember while he's gone
Oh won't you please take care of the baby?

Apples nuts and candy oh what a Christmas feel

A good old country Christmas that's what it's gonna be
With all the family gathered round our pretty Christmas tree
We'll open up our presents Christmas Eve about midnight

Loretta Lynn,Standing Room Only,"Standing room only, not even room to kneel and pray
Standing room only on the Judgment Day

Last night, I had an awful dream that the end of time had come
The trumpet had been sounded and life on earth was done
An angel stood, one foot on land, the other foot on sea
And as I tried to kneel and pray, a voice said unto me
There's standing room only, it's too late now to pray
There's standing room only, this is the Judgment Day
People filled each church and churchyard just as far as I could see
I heard a pitiful cry for mercy and then I realized it was me
I saw the Savior did appear, as he split the eastern sky
I saw tears of joy on a Christian's face and I heard the sinners cry
And as I tried to touch his hand with one last eager plea
I cried again, ""Have mercy, have mercy, Lord, on me""
I saw a tear come to his eye as he turned my soul away
I didn't know him yesterday and he knew me not today
The earth was burning all around, the world went up in smoke
And as the flames came off me, thank God I awoke
Then I got out of bed and got down on my knees
And you should've heard me pray
For in my dream, I witnessed God's great Judgment Day

Standing room only on God's great Judgment Day"
Loretta Lynn,Ten Thousand Angels,"He could have called ten thousand angels

They bound the hands of Jesus in the garden where he prayed
They led him through the streets in shame
They spat upon the Savior, so pure and free from sin
They said crucify him, he's to blame

He could have called ten thousand angels
To destroy the world and set him free
He could have called ten thousand angels
But he died alone for you and me

Upon his precious head, they placed a crown of thorns
They laughed and said, ""Behold the king""
They struck him and they cursed him and mocked his holy name
And all alone, he suffered everything

He could have called ten thousand angels
To destroy the world and set him free
He could have called ten thousand angels
But he died alone for you and me"
Loretta Lynn,Wings Upon Your Horns,"Before you first made love to me
You called me your wife-to-be
And after that, I saw the devil in your eyes
With your sweet smooth-talkin' ways
You turned a flame into a blaze
Then I'd have let you hang my wings upon your horns

Don't tell me that I'm no saint
I'm the first to know I ain't
There's a little thing called love
And that's what changed me
From an innocent country girl to a woman of the world
The night I let you hang my wings upon your horns

You hung my wings upon your horns
And turned my halo into thorns
And turned me to a woman I can't stand
You're the first to ever make me fall in love
And then not take me
The night I let you hang my wings upon your horns

You hung my wings upon your horns
And turned my halo into thorns
And turned me to a woman I can't stand
You're the first to ever make me fall in love
And then not take me
The night I let you hang my wings upon your horns"
Loretta Lynn,If I Could Hear My Mother Pray Again,"How sweet and happy seem those days of which I dream
When memory recalls them now and then
And with what rapture sweet my weary heart would beat
If I could hear my mother pray again

If I could hear my mother pray again
If I could hear her tender voice as then
How glad I would be, would mean so much to me
If I could hear my mother pray again

She used to pray that I on Jesus would rely
And always walk the shining gospel way
So trusting still His love, I'll seek that home above
For I shall meet my mother some glad day

If I could hear my mother pray again
If I could hear her tender voice as then
How glad I would be, would mean so much to me
If I could hear my mother pray again"
Loretta Lynn,In the Pines,"In the pines, in the pines where the sun never shines
And we shiver when the cold winds blow
My love, my love, what have I done
To make you treat me so?

You've caused me to weep, you've caused me to mourn
You've caused me to lose my home
In the pines, in the pines where the sun never shines
And we shiver when the cold winds blow

The longest train I ever saw
Went down that Georgia line
The engine passed at six o'clock
The caboose went by at nine

In the pines, in the pines where the sun never shines
And we shiver when the cold winds blow

It's long steel rail and a short cross tie
I'm on my way back home
In the pines, in the pines where the sun never shines
And we shiver when the cold winds blow

Hoo hoo hoo hoo"
Loretta Lynn,Blue Kentucky Girl,"[Verse 1]
You left me for the bright lights of the town
A country boy set out to see the world
Remember when those city lights shine down
That big old moon shines on your Kentucky Girl

[Chorus]
I swear I love you by the moon above you
How bright is it shining in your world?
Some morning when you wake up all alone
Just come on home to your blue Kentucky Girl

[Verse 2]
Don't wait to bring great riches home to me
I need no diamond rings or fancy pearls
Just bring yourself, you're all I'll ever need
That's good enough for this blue Kentucky Girl

[Chorus]
I swear I love you by stars above you
How bright is it shining in your world?
Some morning when you wake up all alone
Just come on home to your blue Kentucky Girl"
Hank Williams Sr,Lovesick Blues,"[Chorus]
I got a feeling called the blues, oh Lord
Since my baby said goodbye
Lord, I don't know what I'll do
All I do is sat and sigh, ""Oh Lord""
The last long day she said goodbye
Well, Lord, I thought I would cry
She'll do me, she'll do you, she's got that kind of loving
Lord, I love to hear her when she calls me sweet daddy

Well I'm in love, I'm in love with a beautiful gal
That's what's the matter with me

But she just wouldn't stay
So now that she is leaving this is all I can say

I got a feeling called the blues oh Lord
Since my baby said goodbye
Lord, I don't know what I'll do
All I do is sat and sigh, ""Oh Lord""

I wouldn't let my dear savior in

No more darkness, no more night
Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight

Worries and fears I claimed for my own
Then like the blind man that God gave back his sight

No more darkness, no more night
Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight

Straight is the gate and narrow the way
Now I have traded the wrong for the right

Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord, I saw the light"
Hank Williams Sr,I’m So Lonesome I Could Cry,"[Verse 1]
Hear that lonesome whippoorwill
He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low
I'm so lonesome I could cry

[Verse 2]
I've never seen a night so long
When time goes crawling by
The moon just went behind the clouds
To hide its face and cry

[Verse 3]
Did you ever see a robin weep
When leaves begin to die?
Like me, he's lost the will to live
I'm so lonesome I could cry

[Verse 4]
The silence of a falling star
Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cry"
Hank Williams Sr,Your Cheatin’ Heart,"[Verse 1]
Your cheatin' heart will make you weep
You'll cry and cry and try to sleep
But sleep won't come the whole night through
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you

[Chorus]
When tears come down like falling rain
You'll toss around and call my name
You'll walk the floor the way I do
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you

[Verse 2]
Your cheatin' heart will pine someday
And crave the love you threw away
The time will come when you'll be blue
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you

[Chorus]
When tears come down like falling rain
You'll toss around and call my name
You'll walk the floor the way I do
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you

Hank Williams Sr,Kaw-Liga,"[Verse 1]
Kaw-Liga was a wooden Indian
Standing by the door
He fell in love with an Indian maid
Over in the antique store
Kaw-Liga just stood there and never let it show
So she could never answer ""yes"" or ""no""

[Verse 2]
He always wore his Sunday feathers
And held a tomahawk
The maiden wore her beads and braids
And hoped someday he'd talk
Kaw-Liga, too stubborn to ever show a sign
Because his heart was made of knotty pine

[Chorus]
Poor old Kaw-Liga, he never got a kiss
Poor old Kaw-Liga, he don't know what he missed
Is it any wonder that his face is red?
Kaw-Liga, that poor old wooden head

[Verse 3]
Kaw-Liga was a lonely Indian
Never went nowhere
His heart was set on the Indian maid
With the coal black hair
Kaw-Liga just stood there and never let it show
So she could never answer ""yes"" or ""no""

[Verse 4]
And then one day, a wealthy customer
Bought the Indian maid
And took her oh so far away
But old Kaw-Liga stayed
Kaw-Liga just stands there as lonely as can be
And wishes he was still an old pine tree

[Chorus]
Poor old Kaw-Liga, he never got a kiss
Poor old Kaw-Liga, he don't know what he missed
Is it any wonder that his face is red?
Kaw-Liga, that poor old wooden head"
Hank Williams Sr,Lost Highway,"[Verse 1]
I'm a rolling stone, all alone and lost
For a life of sin, I have paid the cost
When I pass by, all the people say
""Just another boy down the lost highway""

[Verse 2]
Just a deck of cards and a jug of wine
And a woman's lies make a life like mine
Oh, the day we met, I went astray
I started rollin' down that lost highway

[Verse 3]
I was just a lad, nearly twenty-two
Neither good nor bad, just a kid like you
And now I'm lost, too late to pray
Lord, I've paid the cost on the lost highway

[Verse 4]
Now, boys, don't start your ramblin' round
On this road of sin or you're sorrow bound
Take my advice or you'll curse the day
You started rollin' down that lost highway"
Hank Williams Sr,"Cold, Cold Heart","[Verse 1]
I tried so hard, my dear
To show that you're my every dream
Yet you're afraid each thing I do
Is just some evil scheme
A memory from your lonesome past
Keeps us so far apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind
And melt your cold, cold heart?

[Verse 2]
Another love before my time
Made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying now
For things I didn't do
In anger, unkind words are said
That make the teardrops start
Why can't I free your doubtful mind
And melt your cold, cold heart?

[Verse 3]
You'll never know how much it hurts
To see you sit and cry
You know you need and want my love
Yet you're afraid to try
Why do you run and hide from life?
To try it just ain't smart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind
And melt your cold, cold heart?

[Verse 4]
There was a time when I believed
That you belonged to me
But now I know your heart is shackled
To a memory
The more I learn to care for you
The more we drift apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind
And melt your cold, cold heart?"
Hank Williams Sr,"Precious Lord, Take My Hand","[Chorus]
Precious Lord, take my hand
Lead me on

Through the storm, through the night
Lead me on to the light
Take my hand precious Lord, lead me home

When my way grows drear precious Lord linger near
When my life is almost gone
Hear my cry
Hear my call
Hold my hand lest I fall
Take my hand precious Lord, lead me home

When the darkness appears and the night draws near
And the day is past and gone
At the river I stand
Guide my feet
Hold my hand
Take my hand precious Lord, lead me home

Precious Lord, take my hand
Lead me on
Let me stand
I am tired, I am weak, I am worn
Through the storm, through the night
Lead me on to the light
Take my hand precious Lord, lead me home"
Hank Williams Sr,Ramblin’ Man,"[Verse 1]
I can settle down and be doin' just fine
'Til I hear an old train rollin' down the line
Then I hurry straight home and pack
And if I didn't go, I believe I'd blow my stack

[Chorus]
I love you, baby
But you gotta understand
When the Lord made me
He made a ramblin' man

[Verse 2]
Some folks might say that I'm no good
That I wouldn't settle down if I could
But when that open road starts to callin' me
There's somethin' o'er the hill that I gotta see

[Chorus]
Sometimes it's hard
But you gotta understand
When the Lord made me
He made a ramblin' man

[Verse 3]
I love to see the towns a-passin' by
And to ride these rails 'neath God's blue sky
Let me travel this land from the mountains to the sea
'Cause that's the life I believe he meant for me

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone
And at my grave you stand
Just say God's called home
Your ramblin' man"
Hank Williams Sr,Move It on Over,"[Verse 1]
Came in last night at a half past ten
That baby of mine wouldn't let me in
So move it on over (move it on over)
Move it on over (move it on over)
Move over, little dog

Hank Williams Sr,Settin’ the Woods on Fire,"[Verse 1]
Comb your hair and paint and powder
You act proud and I'll act prouder
You sing loud and I'll sing louder
Tonight we're settin' the woods on fire

[Verse 2]
You're my gal and I'm your feller
Dress up in your frock of yeller
I'll look swell but you'll look sweller
Settin' the woods on fire

[Bridge]
We'll take in all the honky tonks
Tonight we're having fun
We'll show the folks a brand new dance
That never has been done

You'll be daffy I'll be dilly
We'll order up two bowls of chili

We'll get hotter than a poker
You'll be broke but I'll be broker
Tonight we're settin' the woods on fire

Up one street and down the other
We'll have a time, oh brother
Settin' the woods on fire

But the air is showin' through

Tomorrow I'll be right back plowin'
Settin' the woods on fire"
Hank Williams Sr,Alone and Forsaken,"[Verse 1]
We met in the springtime
When blossoms unfold
The pastures were green
And the meadows were gold

[Verse 2]
Our love was in flower
As summer grew on
Her love, like the leaves
Now has withered and gone

[Verse 3]
The roses have faded
There's frost at my door
The birds in the morning
Don't sing anymore

[Verse 4]
The grass in the valley
Is starting to die
And out in the darkness
The whip-poor-wills cry

[Chorus]
Alone and forsaken
By fate and by man
Oh, lord if you hear me
Please hold my hand
Oh, please understand

[Verse 5]
Oh, where has she gone to
Oh, where can she be?
She may have forsaken
Some other like me

[Verse 6]
She promised to honor
To love and obey
Each vow was a plaything
That she threw away

[Verse 7]
The darkness is falling
The sky has turned gray
A hound in the distance
Is starting to bay

[Verse 8]
I wonder, I wonder
What she's thinking of?
Forsaken, forgotten
Without any love

[Chorus]
Alone and forsaken
By fate and by man
Oh, lord if you hear me
Please hold my hand
Oh, please understand"
Hank Williams Sr,Long Gone Lonesome Blues,"[Verse 1]
I went down to the river to watch the fish swim by
But I got to the river so lonesome I wanted to die, oh Lord
And then I jumped in the river, but the doggone river was dry

[Refrain]
She's long gone
And now I'm lonesome blue

[Verse 2]
I had me a woman who couldn't be true
She made me for my money and she made me blue
A man needs a woman that he can lean on
But my leanin' post is done left and gone

[Refrain]
She's long gone
And now I'm lonesome blue

[Verse 3]
I'm gonna find me a river, one that's cold as ice
And when I find me that river, Lord I'm gonna pay the price, oh Lord
I'm goin' down in it three times, but Lord I'm only comin' up twice

[Refrain]
She's long gone
And now I'm lonesome blue

[Verse 4]
She told me on Sunday she was checkin' me out
Long about Monday she was nowhere about
And here it is Tuesday, ain't had no news
I got them gone but not forgotten blues

She's long gone
And now I'm lonesome blue"

The news is out all over town
That you've been seen a-runnin' 'round
I know that I should leave, but then
I just can't go, you win again

[Verse 2]
This heart of mine could never see
What everybody knew but me
Just trusting you was my great sin
What can I do? You win again

[Verse 3]
I'm sorry for your victim now
'Cause soon his head like mine will bow
He'll give his heart but all in vain
And someday say you win again

[Verse 4]
You have no heart, you have no shame
You take true love and give the blame
I guess that I should not complain
I love you, still you win again"
Hank Williams Sr,I’ll Never Get Out of This World Alive,"[Verse 1]
Now you're lookin' at a man that's gettin' kinda mad
I had lots of luck but it's all been bad
No matter how I struggle and strive
I'll never get out of this world alive

My fishin' pole's broke, the creek is full of sand
My woman run away with another man
No matter how I struggle and strive

A distant uncle passed away
And left me quite a batch
And I was living high until that fatal day
A lawyer proved I wasn't borned, I was only hatched

If I jumped in the river, I would probably drown
No matter how I struggle and strive
I'll never get out of this world alive

Is full of holes and nails
And brother, if I stepped on a worn-out dime
I bet a nickel I could tell you if it was heads or tails

'Cause nothin's ever gonna be alright no how
No matter how I struggle and strive
I'll never get out of this world alive"

How I long once more to be

How I long once more to be

Hank Williams Sr,A House Of Gold,"[Verse 1]
People steal, they cheat and lie
For wealth and what it will buy
Don't they know on the judgement day
That their gold and silver will melt away

[Verse 2]
I'd rather be in a deep, dark grave
And know that my poor soul was saved
Than to live in this world in a house of gold
And deny my God and doom my soul

Jesus said, come on to me
I'll break sin's chains and set you free
I'll carry you to a home on high
Where you'll never, never die

What good is gold and silver, too
When your heart's not good and true
Sinner hear me when I say
Fall down on your knees and pray

Jesus died there on the cross
So this world would not be lost
Sinner hear now what I say
For someday you'll have to pay

What good is gold and silver too
If your heart's not good and true
Sinner, hear me when I say
Fall down on your knees and pray"

Hank Williams Sr,Dust On The bible,"I went into a home one day just to see some friends of mine
Of all their books and magazines, not a Bible could I find
I asked them for the Bible when they brought it, what a shame
For the dust was covered o'er it, not a fingerprint was plain

Dust on the Bible, dust on the Holy Word
The words of all the prophets and the sayings of our Lord
Of all the other books you'll find, there's none salvation holds
Get the dust off the Bible and redeem your poor soul

Oh, you can read your magazines of love and tragic things
But not one word of Bible verse, not a scripture do you know
When it is the very truth and it's contents good for you
But it's dust is covered o'er it
And it's sure to doom your poor soul

Dust on the Bible, dust on the Holy Word
The word of all the prophets, and the sayings of our Lord
Of all the other books you'll find, there's none salvation holds
Get the dust off the Bible and redeem your poor soul

Oh, if you have a friend you'd like to help along life's way
Just tell him that the Good Book shows a mortal how to pray
The best advice to give him that will make his burdens light
Is to dust the family bible trades the wrong way for the right

Dust on the Bible, dust on the Holy Word
The word of all the prophets, and the sayings of our Lord
Of all the other books you'll find, there's none salvation holds
Get the dust off the Bible and redeem your poor soul"
Hank Williams Sr,I Can’t Help It (If I’m Still in Love with You),"[Verse 1]
Today I passed you on the street
And my heart fell at your feet
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
Somebody else stood by your side
And he looked so satisfied
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

[Verse 2]
A picture from the past came slowly stealin'
As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you
Then suddenly I got that old time feelin'
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

[Verse 3]
It's hard to know another's lips will kiss you
And hold you just the way I used to do
Oh, Heaven only knows how much I miss you
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you"
Hank Williams Sr,Why Don’t You Love Me (Like You Used to Do),"[Verse 1]
Well, why don't you love me like you used to do?
How come you treat me like a worn-out shoe?
My hair's still curly and my eyes are still blue
Why don't you love me like you used to do?

[Chorus]
Ain't had no lovin' like a-huggin' and a-kissin'
In a long, long while
We don't get nearer or further or closer
Than a country mile

[Verse 2]
Why don't you spark me like you used to do
And say sweet nothin's like you used to coo?
I'm the same old trouble that you've always been through
So why don't you love me like you used to do?

[Verse 3]
Well, why don't you be just like you used to be?
How come you find so many faults with me?
Somebody's changed, so let me give you a clue
Why don't you love me like you used to do?

[Chorus]
Ain't had no lovin' like a-huggin' and a-kissin'
In a long, long while
We don't get nearer or further or closer
Than a country mile

What makes you treat me like a piece of clay?
My hair's still curly and my eyes are still blue
Why don't you love me like you used to do?"
Hank Williams Sr,Cool Water,"All day I've faced the barren waste
With out the taste of water... cool, water
Ole Dan and I, with throats burned dry
And souls that cry
For water... cool, clear water

The nights are cool and I'm a fool
Each star's a pool of water... cool, clear water
And with the dawn I'll wake and yawn
And carry on
To water... cool, clear water

The shadows sway and seem to say
Tonight we pray for water.... cool, clear water
And way up there He'll hear our prayer
And show us where
There's water... cool, clear water

Keep a-movin' Dan. Don't you listen to him Dan
He's the devil, not a man
He spreads the burnin' sand with water
Say Dan can't you see that big green tree
Where the water's runnin' free
It's waiting there for you and me
And water.... cool, clear water

Dan's feet are sore he's yearnin' for
Just one thing more than water.... cool, clear water
Like me I guess he'd like to rest
Where there's no quest
For water... cool, clear water"

I'm gonna tuck my worries underneath my arm
And scat right back to my pappy's farm

And leave these honky tonk blues
Yeah, the honky tonk blues
Well Lord, I got 'em
I got the honky tonk blues"
George Jones,He Stopped Loving Her Today,"[Verse 1]
He said, ""I'll love you til I die""
She told him, ""You'll forget in time""
As the years went slowly by
She still preyed upon his mind
He kept her picture on his wall
Went half crazy now and then
But he still loved her through it all
Hoping she'd come back again

[Verse 2]
He kept some letters by his bed
Dated 1962
He had underlined in red
Every single 'I love you'
I went to see him just today
Oh but I didn't see no tears
All dressed up to go away
First time I'd seen him smile in years

[Chorus]
He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today

[Bridge]
You know she came to see him one last time
Oh, and we all wondered if she would
And it kept runnin' through my mind
This time, he's over her for good

[Chorus]
He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today"
George Jones,Choices,"Chorus:
I've had choices
Since the day that I was born
There were voices
That told me right from wrong
If I had listened
No, I wouldn't be here today
Living and dying
With the choices I've made
I was tempted
By an early age I found
I liked drinkin'
Oh, and I never turned it down
There were loved ones
But I turned them all away
Now I'm living and dying
With the choices I've made
Chorus:
I've had choices
Since the day that I was born
There were voices
That told me right from wrong
If I had listened
No, I wouldn't be here today
Living and dying
With the choices I've made

I guess I'm payin'
For the things that I have done
If I could go back
Oh, Lord knows I'd run
But I'm still losin'
This game of life I play
Living and dying
With the choices I've made
Chorus:
I've had choices
Since the day that I was born
There were voices
That told me right from wrong
If I had listened
I wouldn't be here today
Living and dying
With the choices I've made

Living and dying
With the choices I've made..."
George Jones,White Lightning,"[Verse 1]
Well, in North Carolina, way back in the hills
Me and my old pappy, and he had him a still
He brewed white lightnin' till the sun went down
And then he'd fill him a jug and he'd pass it around
Mighty, mighty pleasin', pappy's corn squeezin'
Whshhhoooh... white lightnin'

[Chorus]
Well, the G men, T men, revenuers too
Searchin' for the place where he made his brew
They were lookin', tryin' to book him
But my pappy kept on cookin'
Whshhhoooh... white lightnin'

[Verse 2]
Well, I asked my old pappy why he called his brew
White lightning 'stead of mountain dew
I took a little sip and right away I knew
As my eyes bugged out and my face turned blue
Lightnin' started flashin', thunder started clashin'
Whshhhoooh... white lightnin'

[Chorus]
Well, the G men, T men, revenuers too
Searchin' for the place where he made his brew
They were lookin', tryin' to book him
But my pappy kept on cookin'
Whshhhoooh... white lightnin'

[Verse 3]
Well, a city slicker came and he said ""I'm tough
I think I wanna taste that powerful stuff""
He took one s-slug and he drank it right down
And I heard him a-moanin' as he hit the ground
Mighty, mighty pleasin', your pappy's corn squeezin'
Whshhhoooh... white lightnin'

[Chorus]
The G men, T men, revenuers too
Searchin' for the place where he made his brew
They were lookin', tryin' to book him
But my pappy kept a-cookin'
Whshhhoooh... white lightnin'"
George Jones,The Race Is On,"[Verse 1]
I feel tears wellin' up cold and deep inside
Like my heart sprung a big break
And the stab of loneliness, sharp and painful
That I may never shake
Now you might say that I was taking it hard
Since you wrote me off with a call
But don't you wager that I'll hide the sorrow
When I may break right down and bawl

[Chorus]
Now the race is on
And here comes pride up the back stretch
Heartache's a-going to the inside
My tears are holding back
They're trying not to fall
My heart's out of the running
True love's scratched for another's sake
The race is on, and it looks like heartache's
And the winner loses all

[Verse 2]
One day I had ventured in love, never once suspecting
What the final results would be
How I lived in fear of waking up each morning
And finding that you'd gone from me
There's aching and pain in my heart
For the day was the one that I hated to face
Somebody new came up to win her
And I came out in second place

[Chorus]
Now the race is on
And here comes pride up the back stretch
Heartache's a-going to the inside
My tears are holding back
They're trying not to fall
My heart's out of the running
True love's scratched for another's sake
The race is on, and it looks like heartache's
And the winner loses all"
George Jones,Tennessee Whiskey,"[Verse 1]
I used to spend my nights out in a barroom
Liquor was the only love I've known
But you rescued me from reaching for the bottle
And you brought me back from being too far gone

[Chorus]
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And I stay stoned on your love all the time

[Verse 2]
I looked for love in all the same old places
Found the bottom of the bottle always dry
But when you poured out your heart, I didn't waste it
'Cause there nothing like your love to get me high

[Chorus]
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And I stay stoned on your love all the time
I stay stoned on your love all the time"
George Jones,Who’s Gonna Fill Their Shoes,"[Verse 1]
You know this old world is full of singers
But just a few are chosen
To tear your heart out when they sing
Imagine life without them
All your radio heroes
Like the outlaw that walks through Jessi's dream
No, there will never be another
Red Headed Stranger
A Man in Black and Folsom Prison Blues
The Okie from Muskogee
Or Hello Darlin'
Lord I wonder, who's gonna fill their shoes?

[Chorus]
Who's gonna fill their shoes
Who's gonna stand that tall
Who's gonna play the Opry
And the Wabash Cannonball
Who's gonna give their heart and soul
To get to me and you
Lord I wonder, who's gonna fill their shoes?

[Verse 2]
God bless the boys from Memphis
Blue Suede Shoes and Elvis
Much too soon he left this world in tears
They tore up the Fifties
Old Jerry Lee and Charlie
And Go Cat Go still echoes through the years
You know the heart of country music
Still beats in Luke the Drifter
You can tell it when he sang I Saw the Light
Old Marty, Hank and Lefty
Why I can feel them right here with me
On this Silver Eagle rolling through the night

[Chorus]
Who's gonna fill their shoes
Who's gonna stand that tall
Who's gonna play the Opry
And the Wabash Cannonball
Who's gonna give their heart and soul
To get to me and you
Lord I wonder, who's gonna fill their shoes?"
George Jones,A Good Year for the Roses,"[Verse 1]
I can hardly bear the sight of lipstick
On the cigarettes there in the ashtray
Lying cold the way you left them
At least your lips caressed them while you packed
And a lip print on a half filled cup of coffee
That you poured and didn't drink
But at least you thought you wanted it
And that's so much more than I can say for me

[Chorus]
But what a good year for the roses
Many blooms still linger there
The lawn could stand another mowing
It's funny, I don't even care
When you turned and walked away
And as the door behind you closes
The only thing I know to say
It's been a good year for the roses

[Verse 2]
After three full years of marriage
It's the first time that you haven't made the bed
I guess the reason we're not talking
There's so little left to say, we haven't said
While a million thoughts go running through my mind
I find I haven't spoke a word
And from the bedroom those familiar sounds
Of our one baby's cryin' goes unheard

[Chorus]
But what a good year for the roses
Many blooms still linger there
The lawn could stand another mowing
It's funny, I don't even care
And when you turned to walk away
And as the door behind you closes
The only thing I know to say
It's been a good year for the roses"
George Jones,The Grand Tour,"[Verse 1]
Step right up, come on in
If you'd like to take the grand tour
Of a lonely house that once was home sweet home
I have nothing here to sell you
Just some things that I will tell you
Some things I know will chill you to the bone

[Verse 2]
Over there sits the chair
Where she'd bring the paper to me
And sit down on my knee
And whisper, ""Oh, I love you""
But now she's gone forever
And this old house will never
Be the same
Without the love that we once knew

[Verse 3]
Straight ahead, that's the bed
Where we lay in love together
And Lord knows we had a good thing going here
See her picture on the table
Don't it look like she'd be able
Just to touch me and say, ""Good morning, dear""?

[Verse 4]
There's her rings, all her things
And her clothes are in the closet
Like she left them
When she tore my world apart
As you leave, you'll see the nursery
Oh, she left me without mercy
Taking nothing but our baby and my heart

[Outro]
Step right up, come on in"
George Jones,Still Doin’ Time,"[Verse 1]
Has it been a year, since the last time I've seen her
My God, I could swear it was ten
And the ocean of liquor I drank to forget her
Is gonna kill me but I'll drink 'til then
I've been living in hell with a bar for a cell
Still paying for my cheating crime
Oh, And I've got a long way to go
Still doin' time

[Chorus]
Still doin' time
In a honky tonk prison
Still doin' time
Where a man ain't forgiven
My poor heart is breaking
But there's no escaping
Each morning I wake up and I find
Still doin' time

[Verse 2]
Oh when you're caught cheating twice
It's twenty to life in a place
Where the sun never shines
And tomorrow you're gonna find me right here
Still doin' time

[Chorus]
Still doin' time
In a honky tonk prison
Still doin' time
Where a man ain't forgiven
My poor heart is breaking
But there's no escaping
Each morning I wake up and I find
Still doin' time
Still doin' time..."
George Jones,The King Is Gone (So Are You),"Last night I broke the seal on a Jim Beam decanter
That looks like Elvis
I soaked the label off a Flintstone Jelly Bean jar
I cleared us off a place on that
One little table that you left us
And pulled me up a big ole piece of floor
I pulled the head off Elvis
Filled Fred up to his pelvis
Yabba Dabba Doo, the King is gone
And so are you

'Round about ten we all got to talking
'Bout Graceland, Bedrock and such
The conversation finally turned to women
But they said they didn't get around too much
Elvis said, ""Find 'em young.""
And Fred said, ""Old Fashioned girls are fun.""
Yabba Dabba Doo, the King is gone
And so are you

Later on it finally hit me
That you wouldn't be 'a comin' home no more
Cause this time I know you won't forgive me
Like all of them other times before
Then I broke Elvis's nose
Pouring the last drop from his toes
Yabba Dabba Doo, the King is gone
And so are you
Yabba Dabba Doo, the King is gone
And so are you"
George Jones,She Thinks I Still Care,"[Verse 1]
Just because I ask a friend about her
Just because I spoke her name somewhere
Just because I rang her number by mistake today
She thinks I still care

[Verse 2]
Just because I haunt the same old places
Where the memory of her lingers everywhere
Just because I'm not the happy guy I used to be
She thinks I still care

[Bridge]
But if she's happy thinking I still need her
Then let that silly notion bring her cheer
But how could she ever be so foolish
Oh where would she get such an idea

[Verse 3]
Just because I ask a friend about her
And just because I spoke her name somewhere
Just because I saw her then went all to pieces
She thinks I still care, she thinks I still care"
George Jones,Ol’ Red,"[Verse 1]
Caught my wife with another man
Now I'm doin' ninety-nine
At a prison down in Georgia
Close to the Florida line
I've been here for twelve long years
And I finally made the warden my friend
So he sentenced me to a life of ease
Takin' care of ol' Red

[Verse 2]
Now ol' red he's a dangerous dog
This old boy has ever seen
He's got a nose that can smell a two day trail
Lord, he's a four legged tracking machine
Just consider yourself mighty lucky
To get past the gators and the quicksand beds
But all these years that I've been here
Ain't nobody got past Red

[Chorus]
Hear the warden say
Come on somebody why don't you run
Ol' Red's a-itchin' to have a little fun?
Get my lantern, get my gun
Red'll have 'em treed 'fore the mornin' come

[Verse 2]
I payed off a guard and he slipped out a letter
To my cousin in Tennessee
And he brought down me a blue tick hound
Lord, she was pretty as she could be
They penned her up in the swampland
About a mile just south of the gate
And when I take ol' Red for his evening run
And I'd just drop him off and wait

[Chorus]
Hear the warden say
Come on somebody why don't you run?
Ol' Red's a-itchin' to have a little fun
Get my latern, get my gun
Red'll have 'em treed 'fore the mornin' come

[Verse 3]
Now old red got use to seein'
This little lady there every night
So I kept him away for three or fours days
And waited till the time was right
I made my run with the evening sun
And I smiled when I heard 'em let him out
'Cause I headed north to Tennessee
And ol' Red was a-headed south

[Chorus]
I hear the warden say
Come on somebody why don't you run?
Ol' Red's a-itchin' to have a little fun
Get my latern, get my gun
Red'll have 'em treed 'fore the mornin' come

[Outro]
Now, there's red hair blue ticks dogs in the south
Love got me in there and love got me out"
George Jones,I Know a Man Who Can,"(Jack Campbell - Jimmie Davis)
George Jones & Sheri Copeland
(George)
I can't take a heart that's broken and make it over again
But I know a man who can
And I can't take a soul, hm, and make it white, whiter than snow
But I know a man who can
Some call Him Savior, the Redeemer of all men
I call him Jesus for He's my dearest friend
If you feel no one can help you and your life is out of hand
Well, I know a man who can
(Sherri)
I can't walk upon the waters or calm a raging sea
But I know a man who can
And I can't cause blind eyes to open, make the lame to rise up and walk again
But I know a man who can
Some call Him Savior, the Redeemeer of all men
I call him Jesus for He's my dearest friend
If you feel no one can help you and your life is out of hand
Well, I know a man who can
(Both)
Some call Him Savior, the Redeemeer of all men
I call Him Jesus for he's my dearest friend
(George)
If you feel no one can help you and your life is out of hand
(Both)
Well I know a man, yes I know a man who can..."
George Jones,If Drinkin’ Don’t Kill Me (Her Memory Will),"[Verse 1]
The bars are all closed, it's four in the morning
Must have shut 'em all down by the shape that I'm in
I lay my head on the wheel and the horn begins honking
The whole neighborhood knows that I'm home drunk again

[Chorus]
If drinking don't kill me, her memory will
I can't hold out much longer, the way that I feel
With the blood from my body, I could start my own still
But if drinking don't kill me, her memory will

[Verse 2]
These old bones, they move slow, but so sure of their footsteps
As I trip on the floor and I lightly touch down
Lord, it's been ten bottles since I tried to forget her
But the memory still lingers lying here on the ground

[Chorus]
If drinking don't kill me, her memory will
I can't hold out much longer, the way that I feel
With the blood from my body, I could start my own still
But if drinking don't kill me, her memory will"
George Jones,The One I Loved Back Then (The Corvette Song),"[Verse 1]
I stopped off at the Quicksack
For some beer and cigarettes
The old man took my money
As he stared at my Corvette
He said, ""I had one just like her, son
In 1963
'Til the man down at the bank
Took her from me""

[Chorus]
Oh, she was hotter than a two dollar pistol
She was the fastest thing around
Long and lean, every young man's dream
She turned every head in town
She was built, and fun to handle, son
I'm glad that you dropped in
She reminds me of the one I loved back then

[Verse 2]
Then I handed him my keys and said
""Here, take her for a spin""
The old man scratched his head
And then he looked at me and grinned
He said, ""Son, you just don't understand
It ain't the car I want
It's the brunette in your 'Vette
That turns me on""

[Chorus]
I had one that was
Hotter than a two dollar pistol
She was the fastest thing around
Long and lean, every young man's dream
She turned every head in town
She was built, and fun to handle, son
I'm glad that you dropped in
She reminds me of the one I loved back then

[Chorus/Outro]
Lord, she was hotter than a two dollar pistol
She was the fastest thing around
Long and lean, every young man's dream
She turned every head in town
She was built, and fun to handle, son
I'm glad that you dropped in
She reminds me of the one I loved back then
She reminds me of the one I loved back then"
George Jones,A Picture of Me (Without You),"[Verse 1]
Imagine a world where no music was playing
Then think of a church with nobody praying
If you've ever looked up at a sky with no blue
Then you've seen a picture of me without you

[Verse 2]
Have you walked in a garden where nothing was growing?
Or stood by a river where nothing was flowing?
If you've seen a red rose unkissed by the dew
Then you've seen a picture of me without you

[Verse 3]
Can you picture Heaven with no angels singing?
Or a quiet Sunday morning with no church bells ringing?
If you've watched as the heart of a child breaks in two
Then you've seen a picture of me without you"
George Jones,Won’t It Be Wonderful There?,"When with the savior we enter the glory land
Won't it be wonderful there
Ended the troubles and cares of the story land
Won't it be wonderful there?
Chorus:
Won't it be wonderful there
Having no burdens to bear
Joyously singing, with heartbells all ringing
Won't it be wonderful there?

Praising, adoring the Matchless Eternal One

Joyously singing, with heartbells all ringing

Won't it be wonderful there
Having no burdens to bear
Joyously singing, with heartbells all ringing
Oh, won't it be wonderful there?..."
George Jones,Borrowed Angel,"[Verse 1]
Her fingers feel so gentle with her hand in mine
Her hair feels like silk on my arm
Her lips tell me so tenderly she's mine alone
Until we part tonight and she goes home

[Chorus]
Borrowed angel, belongs to someone else
I love my borrowed angel, I just can't help myself
That ring upon her finger don't belong to me
But she loves me and I know she'll save
Some borrowed time for me

[Verse 2]
I wish that I could have her more than just tonight
We can't go on like this, it isn't right
When that lonesome feelin' comes a-knockin' on my door
I'll call my borrowed angel to ease the pain once more

[Chorus]
Borrowed angel, belongs to someone else
I love my borrowed angel, I just can't help myself
That ring upon her finger don't belong to me
But she loves me and I know she'll save
Some borrowed time for me
But she loves me and I know she'll save
Some borrowed time for me"
George Jones,I Don’t Need Your Rockin’ Chair,"[Chorus]
I don't need your rockin' chair
Your Geritol or your Medicare
Well, I still got neon in my veins
This grey hair don't mean a thing
I do my rockin' on the stage
You can't put this possum in a cage
My body's old but it ain't impaired
I don't need your rockin' chair

[Verse 1]
I ain't ready for the junkyard yet
'Cause I still feel like a new Corvette
It might take a little longer but I'll get there
Well, I don't need your rockin' chair

[Chorus]
I don't need your rockin' chair
Your Geritol or your Medicare
I've still got neon in my veins
This grey hair don't mean a thing
I do my rockin' on the stage
You can't put this possum in a cage
My body's old but it ain't impaired
I don't need this rockin' chair

[Verse 2]
Retirement don't fit in my plans
You can keep your seat, I'm a-gonna stand
An Eskimo needs a Fridgedaire
Like I need your rockin' chair

[Chorus]
I don't need your rockin' chair (He don't need your rockin' chair)
Your Geritol or your Medicare (Geritol or your Medicare)
I've still got neon in my veins (Still got neon in his veins)
This grey hair don't mean a thing (HIs grey hair don't mean a thing)
I do my rockin' on the stage (Does his rockin' on the stage)
You can't put this possum in a cage (Can't put this possum in a cage)
Yeah, my body's old but it ain't impaired (Well, you know it ain't impaired)

George Jones,"Jesus, Hold My Hand","[Verse 1]
As I travel through this pilgrim land
There is a friend who walks with me
Leads me safely through the sinking sand
It is the Christ at Calvary
This would be my prayer dear Lord each day
To help me do the best I can
For I need Thy light to guide me day and night
Blessed Jesus hold my hand

[Chorus]
Jesus hold my hand
I need thee every hour
Through this pilgrim land
Protect me by thy power
Hear my feeble plea
O Lord look down on me
When I kneel in prayer I hope to meet you there
Blessed Jesus hold my hand

[Verse 2]
Let me travel in the light divine
That I may see the blessed way
Keep me that I may be wholly Thine
And sing redemption's song some day
I will be a soldier brave and true
And ever firmly take a stand
As I onward go and daily meet the foe
Blessed Jesus hold my hand

[Chorus]

[Outro]
When I kneel in prayer I hope to meet you there
Blessed Jesus hold my hand"
George Jones,The Door,"I've heard the sound of my dear old mama crying
And the sound of the train that took me off to war
The awful sound of a thousand bombs exploding
And I wondered if I could take it anymore
There were times when they almost drove me crazy
But I did my best and took it like a man
And who would think in my lonely room I'd hear it
The one sound in the world my heart can't stand
To hear that sound and to know its really over
Through tear stained eyes I watched her walk away
And of earthquakes, storms and guns and war
Lord, nothing has ever hurt me more than that lonely sound
The closing of the door
And of earthquakes, storms and guns and war
Lord, nothing ever hurt me more than that lonely sound
The closing of the door..."
George Jones,Walk Through This World With Me,"Walk through this world with me
Go where I go
Share all my my dreams with me
I need you so
In life we search and some of us find
I've looked for you a long, long time

And now that I've found you
New horizons I see
Come take my hand
And walk through this world with me

--- Instrumental ---

Walk through this world with me
Go where I go
Share all my dreams with me
I searched for you so

And now that I've found you
New horizons I see
Come take my hand
And walk through this world with me

Come take my hand
And walk through this world with me..."
George Jones,Finally Friday,"[Verse 1]
I got a hundred dollars smoking in my billfold
I know I ought to save it but it's burning a hole
Right through my pocket and into my skin
Come Monday morning I'll be broke again

[Chorus]
It's finally Friday, I'm free again
I got my motor running for a wild weekend
It's finally Friday, I'm out of control
Forget the working blues and let the good times roll

[Verse 2]
I got a little sugar baby down the road
She's sitting on a radio and rocking on roll
We'll dance up a storm and later all night
We'll be working on doing all the wrong things right

[Chorus]
It's finally Friday, I'm free again
I got my motor running for a wild weekend
It's finally Friday, I'm out of control
Forget the working blues and let the good times roll

[Bridge]
Monday, I'll be hurting with my head in a vice
Tuesday, I'll be wondering if I'll ever survive
Wednesday and Thursday, I'll be slowly tuning in
Friday, I'll be revving up my motor again

[Chorus]
It's finally Friday, I'm free again
I got my motor running for a wild weekend
It's finally Friday, I'm out of control
Forget the working blues and let the good times roll
It's finally Friday, I'm free again
I got my motor running for a wild weekend
It's finally Friday, I'm out of control
Forget the working blues and let the good times roll"
George Jones,You’re Still On My Mind,"[Verse 1]
The jukebox is playing
A honky-tonk song
""One more,"" I keep saying
""And then I'll go home""
What good would it do me?
I know what I'll find

[Chorus]
An empty bottle
A broken heart
And you're still on my mind

[Verse 2]
The people are laughing
And having their fun
While I sit here crying
Over what you have done
My pockets are empty
My last drink of wine

[Chorus]
An empty bottle
A broken heart
And you're still on my mind

[Piano Solo]

[Verse 3]
Alone and forsaken
So blue I could die
I just sit here drinking
Till the bottle runs dry
To try and forget you
I turn to the wine

[Chorus]
An empty bottle
A broken heart
And you're still on my mind"
George Jones,From Strangers To Lovers To Friends,"I'm really glad that you called me
I'm unhappy you found someone new
I've been looking myself and if I'd find someone else
First so I'm telling is you
We're better off to have known love
We're more than we might have been
How many can say they went all the way
From strangers to lovers to friends
Things could have turned out much different
We could have been strangers again
We were lucky to learn watched the bridge has been burned
Only fools try to cross it again
Oh, I know that I'm going to miss you
And although I'm hurt now and then
I'll never regret what we went through to get
From strangers to lovers to friends
I'm not one that sorry I loved you
Or not do it all over again
I remember we cried when we walked side by side
From strangers to lovers to friends..."
Garth Brooks,The Thunder Rolls,"[Verse 1]
Three thirty in the mornin', not a soul in sight
The city's lookin' like a ghost town on a moonless summer night
Raindrops on the windshield, there's a storm movin' in
He's headin' back from somewhere that he never should have been

[Refrain]
And the thunder rolls
And the thunder rolls

[Verse 2]
Every light is burnin' in a house across town
She's pacin' by the telephone in her faded flannel gown
Askin' for a miracle, hopin' she's not right
Prayin' it's the weather that's kept him out all night

[Refrain]
And the thunder rolls
And the thunder rolls

[Chorus]
The thunder rolls, and the lightnin' strikes
Another love grows cold on a sleepless night
As the storm blows on out of control
Deep in her heart the thunder rolls

[Verse 3]
She's waitin' by the window when he pulls into the drive
She rushes out to hold him, thankful he's alive
But on the wind and rain a strange new perfume blows
And the lightnin' flashes in her eyes, and he knows that she knows

[Refrain]
And the thunder rolls
And the thunder rolls

[Chorus]
The thunder rolls, and the lightnin' strikes
Another love grows cold on a sleepless night
As the storm blows on out of control
Deep in her heart the thunder rolls
[Verse 4]
She runs back down the hallway, and through the bedroom door
She reaches for the pistol kept in the dresser drawer
Tells the lady in the mirror, ""He won't do this again""
'Cause tonight will be the last time she'll wonder where he's been

[Chorus]
The thunder rolls, and the lightnin' strikes
Another love grows cold on a sleepless night
As the storm blows on out of control
Deep in her heart the thunder rolls"
Garth Brooks,Friends in Low Places (Live),"[Verse 1]
Blame it all on my roots, I showed up in boots
And ruined your black tie affair
The last one to know, the last one to show
I was the last one you thought you'd see there
And I saw the surprise, and the fear in his eyes
When I took his glass of champagne
And I toasted you, said, ""Honey, we may be through
But you'll never hear me complain""

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns and the beer chases
My blues away and I'll be okay
I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the Oasis
Oh, I've got friends, in low places

[Verse 2]
Well, I guess I was wrong, I just don't belong
But then, I've been there before
Everything's alright, I'll just say goodnight
And I'll show myself to the door
Hey, I didn't mean, to cause a big scene
Just give me an hour and then
Well I'll be as high as that ivory tower
That you're livin' in

I guess I was wrong, I just don't belong
But then, I've been there before
And everything is alright, I'll just say goodnight
And I'll show myself to the door
I didn't mean to cause a big scene
Just wait 'til I finish this glass
Then sweet little lady I'll head back to the bar
Help me out now
And you can kiss my ass

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns and the beer chases
My blues away and I'll be okay
I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the Oasis

Now it's all you guys, let me hear it, okay?
I've got friends in low places

In low places

[Chorus: Garth Brooks with Crowd]
I got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
And I'll be okay
Yeah, I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis
Oh, I got friends
In low places
Yeah, I got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
And I'll be okay
Yeah, I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis
Oh, I got friends
In low places
Yeah, I got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
And I'll be okay"
Garth Brooks,The River,"[Verse 1]
You know a dream is like a river
Ever changin' as it flows
And a dreamer's just a vessel
That must follow where it goes
Trying to learn from what's behind you
And never knowing what's in store
Makes each day a constant battle
Just to stay between the shores

[Chorus]
And I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
Like a bird upon the wind
These waters are my sky
I'll never reach my destination
If I never try
So, I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry

[Verse 2]
Too many times we stand aside
And let the waters slip away
Till what we put off till tomorrow
Has now become today
So don't you sit upon the shoreline
And say you're satisfied
Choose to chance the rapids
And dare to dance the tide

[Chorus]
Yes, I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
Like a bird upon the wind
These waters are my sky
I'll never reach my destination
If I never try
So, I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry

[Bridge]
And there's bound to be rough waters
And I know I'll take some falls
But with the good Lord as my captain
I can make it through them all

[Chorus]
Yes, I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
Like a bird upon the wind
These waters are my sky
I'll never reach my destination
If I never try
So, I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry

[Outro]
Yes, I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
'Til the river runs dry"
Garth Brooks,Ask Me How I Know,"[Verse 1]
You're stubborn as they come, you'll never settle down
You'll always be the one who doesn't stick around
You make all the rules, you're set in your ways
You gotta have your freedom, you gotta have your space

[Chorus]
But one day you'll meet the girl you swore you'd never find
Start feelin' things you never felt and spendin' all your time
Tryin' to figure out how she got this hold on you
And when you start to fall, you'll hold onto your pride
Start buildin' up your walls and never let her get inside
You'll push her away 'cause that's all you know how to do
And then she'll leave and you won't beg her not to go
Ask me how I know

[Verse 2]
Go on and shake your head and tell me that I'm wrong
Say I'm just another fool and this is just another song
But I know how you are, 'cause I know how I am
And I'd give anything to go back and try again

[Chorus]
But one day you'll meet the girl you swore you'd never find
Start feelin' things you never felt and spendin' all your time
Tryin' to figure out how she got this hold on you
And when you start to fall, you'll hold onto your pride
Start buildin' up your walls and never let her get inside
You'll push her away 'cause that's all you know how to do
And then she'll leave and you won't beg her not to go
Ask me how I know

[Bridge]
And you best put this song on repeat
Maybe then you won't end up like me

[Chorus]
But one day you'll meet the girl you swore you'd never find
Start feelin' things you never felt and spendin' all your time
Tryin' to figure out how she got this hold on you
And when you start to fall, you'll hold onto your pride
Start buildin' up your walls and never let her get inside
You'll push her away 'cause that's all you know how to do
And then she'll leave and you won't beg her not to go
Ask me how I know"
Garth Brooks,If Tomorrow Never Comes,"[Verse 1]
Sometimes late at night
I lie awake and watch her sleeping
She's lost in peaceful dreams
So, I turn out the lights and lay there in the dark
And the thought crosses my mind
If I never wake up in the morning
Would she ever doubt the way I feel
About her in my heart?

[Chorus]
If tomorrow never comes
Will she know how much I loved her?
Did I try in every way to show her every day
That she's my only one?
And if my time on earth were through
And she must face the world without me
Is the love I gave her in the past
Gonna be enough to last
If tomorrow never comes?

[Verse 2]
'Cause I've lost loved ones in my life
Who never knew how much I loved them
Now I live with the regret
That my true feelin's for them never were revealed
So, I made a promise to myself
To say each day how much she means to me
And avoid that circumstance
Where there's no second chance to tell her how I feel

[Chorus]
'Cause if tomorrow never comes
Will she know how much I loved her?
Did I try in every way to show her every day
That she's my only one?
And if my time on earth were through
And she must face the world without me
Is the love I gave her in the past
Gonna be enough to last
If tomorrow never comes?

[Outro]
So, tell that someone that you love
Just what you're thinkin' of
If tomorrow never comes"
Garth Brooks,That Summer,"[Verse 1]
I went to work for her that summer
A teenage kid so far from home
She was a lonely widow woman
Hell-bent to make it on her own
We were a thousand miles from nowhere
Wheat fields as far as I could see
Both needin' somethin' from each other
Not knowin' yet what that might be

[Verse 2]
'Til she came to me one evenin'
Hot cup of coffee and a smile
In a dress that I was certain
She hadn't worn in quite a while
There was a difference in her laughter
There was a softness in her eyes
And on the air, there was a hunger
Even a boy could recognize

[Chorus]
She had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightnin' from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Ragin' in her lover's eyes
She had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burnin' bright
Rushin' headlong in the wind, out where only dreams have been
Burnin' both ends of the night

[Verse 3]
That summer wind was all around me
Nothin' between us but the night
And when I told her that I'd never
She softly whispered that's alright
And then I watched her hands of leather
Turn to velvet in a touch
There's never been another summer
When I have ever learned so much

[Chorus]
We had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightnin' from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Ragin' in each other's eyes
We had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burnin' bright
Rushin' headlong in the wind, out where only dreams have been
Burnin' both ends of the night

[Verse 3]
I often think about that summer
The sweat, the moonlight, and the lace
And I have rarely held another
When I haven't seen her face
And every time I pass a wheat field
And watch it dancin' with the wind
Although I know it isn't real, I just can't help but feel
Her hungry arms again

[Chorus]
She had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightnin' from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Ragin' in her lover's eyes
She had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burnin' bright
Rushin' headlong in the wind, out where only dreams have been
Burnin' both ends of the night

[Outro]
Rushin' headlong in the wind, out where only dreams have been
Burnin' both ends of the night"
Garth Brooks,The Dance,"[Verse 1]
Lookin' back on the memory of
The dance we shared, beneath the stars above
For a moment all the world was right
How could I have known that you'd ever say goodbye

[Chorus]
And now, I'm glad I didn't know
The way it all would end, the way it all would go
Our lives are better left to chance
I could have missed the pain
But I'd of had to miss the dance

[Verse 2]
Holding you, I held everything
For a moment, wasn't I the king
But if I'd only known how the king would fall
Hey, who's to say, you know I might have changed it all

[Chorus]
And now, I'm glad I didn't know
The way it all would end, the way it all would go
Our lives are better left to chance
I could have missed the pain
But I'd of had to miss the dance

[Outro]
Yes, my life, it's better left to chance
I could have missed the pain
But I'd of had to miss the dance"
Garth Brooks,The Thunder Rolls (Live Long Version),"[Verse 1]
Three-thirty in the mornin', not a soul in sight
The city's lookin' like a ghost town on a moonless summer night
Raindrops on the windshield, there's a storm movin' in
He's headin' back from somewhere, that he never should have been

[Refrain]
And the thunder rolls
And the thunder rolls

[Verse 2]
Every light is burnin', in a house across town
She's pacin' by the telephone in her faded flannel gown
Askin' for a miracle, hopin' she's not right
Prayin' it's the weather that's kept him out all night

[Refrain]
And the thunder rolls
And the thunder rolls

[Chorus]
The thunder rolls and the lightnin' strikes
Another love grows cold, on a sleepless night
As the storm blows on out of control
Deep in her heart, the thunder rolls

[Verse 3]
She's waiting by the window when he pulls into the drive
She rushes out to hold him, thankful he's alive
But on the wind and rain a strange new perfume blows
And the lightnin' flashes in her eyes and he knows that she knows

[Refrain]
And the thunder rolls
And the thunder rolls

[Chorus]
The thunder rolls and the lightnin' strikes
Another love grows cold, darlin', on a sleepless night
As the storm blows on out of control
Deep in her heart, the thunder rolls

[Interlude]

[Verse 4]
She runs back down the hallway and through the bedroom door
She reaches for the pistol kept in the dresser drawer
Tells the lady in the mirror, ""He won't do this again
'Cause tonight will be the last time, she'll wonder where he's been""

[Chorus]
The thunder rolls and the lightnin' strikes
Another love grows cold, darlin', on a sleepless night
As the storm blows on out of control
Deep in her heart, the thunder rolls"
Garth Brooks,Mom,"[Verse 1]
A little baby told God, ""Hey, I'm kinda scared
Don't really know if I wanna go down there
From here it looks like a little blue ball
But that's a great big place and I'm so small""

[Verse 2]
Why can't I just stay here with you?
Did I make you mad, don't you want me, too?
And God said, ""Oh, child, of course I do
But there's somebody special waiting for you""

[Chorus]
So, hush now, baby
Don't you cry
'Cause there's someone down there waiting
Whose only goal in life
Is making you sure you're always
Gonna be alright
A loving angel, tender tough and strong
It's almost time to go and meet your mom

[Verse 3]
You'll never have a better friend
Or a warmer touch to tuck you in
And she'll kiss your bruises, your bumps and scrapes
And anytime you hurt, her heart's gonna break

[Chorus]
So, hush now, baby
Don't you cry
'Cause there's someone down there waiting
Whose only goal in life
Is making you sure you're always
Gonna be alright
A loving angel, tender tough and strong
It's almost time to go and meet your mom

[Bridge]
Now when she’s talking to you
Make sure you listen close
Cause she's gonna teach everything
You'll ever need to know
Like how to mind your manners
To love and laugh and dream
And she'll put you on the path
That'll bring you back to me

[Chorus]
So, hush now, baby
Don't you cry
'Cause there's someone down there waiting
Whose only goal in life
Is making you sure you're always
Gonna be alright
A loving angel, tender tough and strong
Come on child it's time to meet your mom"
Garth Brooks,Unanswered Prayers,"[Verse 1]
Just the other night at a hometown football game
My wife and I ran into my old high school flame
And as I introduced them, the past came back to me
And I couldn't help but think of the way things used to be

[Verse 2]
She was the one that I'd wanted for all times
And each night I'd spend prayin' that God would make her mine
And if He'd only grant me this wish I wished back then
I'd never ask for anything again

[Chorus]
Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers
Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs
And just because He doesn't answer doesn't mean He don't care
'Cause some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers

[Verse 3]
She wasn't quite the angel that I remembered in my dreams
And I could tell that time had changed me, in her eyes too it seemed
We tried to talk about the old days, there wasn't much we could recall
I guess the Lord knows what He's doin', after all

[Bridge]
And as she walked away, well, I looked at my wife
And then and there I thanked the good Lord for the gifts in my life

[Chorus]
Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers
Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs
And just because He may not answer doesn't mean He don't care
'Cause some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered...
Some of God's greatest gifts are all too often unanswered...
Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers"
Garth Brooks,Papa Loved Mama,"[Verse 1]
Papa drove a truck nearly all his life
You know it drove mama crazy bein' a trucker's wife
The part she couldn't handle was the bein' alone
I guess she needed more to hold than just a telephone
Papa called Mama each and every night
Just to ask her how she was and if us kids were alright
Mama would wait for that call to come in
But when Daddy'd hang up she was gone again

[Chorus]
Mama was a looker, Lord, how she shined
Papa was a good 'ne, but the jealous kind
Papa loved Mama, Mama loved men
Mama's in the graveyard, Papa's in the pen

[Verse 2]
Well, it was bound to happen and one night it did
Papa came home and it was just us kids
He had a dozen roses and a bottle of wine
If he was lookin' to surprise us he was doin' fine
I heard him cry for Mama up and down the hall
Then I heard a bottle break against the bedroom wall
That old diesel engine made an eerie sound
When Papa fired it up and headed into town

[Bridge]
Oh, the picture in the paper showed the scene real well
Papa's rig was buried in the local motel
The desk clerk said he saw it all real clear
He never hit the brakes and he was shiftin' gears

[Chorus]
Mama was a looker, Lord, how she shined
Papa was a good'n, but the jealous kind
Papa loved Mama, Mama loved men
Mama's in the graveyard, Papa's in the pen"
Garth Brooks,More Than a Memory,"[Verse 1]
People say she's only in my head
It's gonna take time but I'll forget
They say I need to get on with my life
But they don't realize

[Chorus]
Is when you're dialin' six numbers just to hang up the phone
Drivin' 'cross town just to see if she's home
Wakin' a friend in the dead of the night
Just to hear him say it's gonna be alright
When you're findin' things to do not to fall asleep
Because you know she'll be there in your dreams
That's when she's
More than a memory

[Verse 2]
Took a match to everything she ever wrote
Watched her words go up in smoke
Tore all her pictures off the wall
That ain't helpin' me at all

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're talkin' out loud but nobody's there
You look like hell and you just don't care
Drinkin' more than you ever drank
Sinkin' down lower than you ever sank
When you find yourself fallin' down upon your knees
Prayin' to God, beggin' him, please
That's when she's
More than a memory

[Bridge]
She's more
She's more

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're dialin' her number just to hang up the phone
Drivin' 'cross town just to see if she's home
Wakin' a friend in the dead of night
Just to hear him say it's gonna be alright
When you're findin' things to do not to fall asleep
'Cause you know she's waiting in your dreams
That's when she's more than a memory

[Outro]
People say she's only in my head
It's gonna take time but I'll forget"
Garth Brooks,Rodeo,"[Verse 1]
His eyes are cold and restless
An' his wounds have almost healed
And she'd give half of Texas
Just to change the way he feels
She knows his love's in Tulsa
An' she knows he's gonna go
Well, it ain't no woman flesh and blood
It's that damned old rodeo

[Chorus]
Well, it's bulls and blood, it's dust and mud
It's the roar of a Sunday crowd
It's the white in his knuckles, the gold in the buckle
He'll win the next go 'round
It's boots and chaps, it's cowboy hats
It's spurs and latigo
It's the ropes and the reins, and the joy and the pain
And they call the thing rodeo

[Verse 2]
Well, she does her best to hold him
When his love comes to call
But his need for it controls him
And her back's against the wall
And it's ""So long girl, I'll see you""
When it's time for him to go
You know the woman wants her cowboy
Like he wants his rodeo

[Chorus]
Well, it's bulls and blood, it's dust and mud
It's the roar of a Sunday crowd
It's the white in his knuckles, the gold in the buckle
He'll win the next go 'round
It's boots and chaps, it's cowboy hats
It's spurs and latigo
It's the ropes and the reins, and the joy and the pain
And they call the thing rodeo

[Bridge]
It'll drive a cowboy crazy
It'll drive a man insane
And he'll sell off everything he owns
Just to pay to play the game
And a broken home and some broken bones
Is all he'll have to show
For all the years that he spent chasin'
This dream they call rodeo

[Chorus]
Well, it's bulls and blood, it's dust and mud
It's the roar of a Sunday crowd
It's the white in his knuckles, the gold in the buckle
He'll win the next go 'round
It's boots and chaps, it's cowboy hats
It's spurs and latigo
It's the ropes and the reins, and the joy and the pain
And they call the thing rodeo

[Outro]
It's the broncs and the blood, it's the steers and the mud
And they call the thing rodeo"
Garth Brooks,Dive Bar,"[Verse 1: Garth Brooks]
Well turn that bottle up and drink it, crank that jukebox up and Hank it
Bartender, pour another round
Here's to our best bad decisions, situation, no conditions
Oh, and memories we all need to drown
So, fill your cup and raise it up
Jump in and join the club
And float this whiskey river reservoir
We're gonna spend the weekend in the deep end of a dive bar

[Verse 2: Blake Shelton, Garth Brooks & Blake Shelton]
'Cause up in here you're not the only loved and left her
Lost and lonely one who's ever swam against the tide
Thinkin' this is your oasis, it's the safest of the places
That a broken heart can find to hide
So, here's a toast coast to coast
With a big old adios
To wishes wasted on them fallin' stars
We're gonna spend the weekend in the deep end of a dive bar

[Bridge: Garth Brooks & Blake Shelton]
Yeah it's just chapter after chapter of happy never after
But that's just the way the story goes
For some barstool believers, wear our heart out on our sleevers
Just goin' where the neon glows

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge: Garth Brooks, Blake Shelton, Garth Brooks & Blake Shelton]
Yeah, it's just chapter after chapter of happy never after
But that's just the way the story goes
Yeah, we're just never quite belongers, hanger on-ers way too longers
Just buzzin' where the neon glows

[Outro: Garth Brooks & Blake Shelton]
Problems, we all got 'em
Let 'em sink down to the bottom
Doesn't matter who or where you are
We're gonna spend the weekend in the deep end
The water's fine, y'all, so just come on in
To the deep end of a dive bar
Of this dive bar
Talkin' 'bout a dive bar"
Garth Brooks,Callin’ Baton Rouge,"[Verse 1]
I spent last night in the arms of a girl in Louisiana
And though I'm out on the highway, my thoughts are still with her
Such a strange combination of a woman and a child
Such a strange situation stoppin' every hundred miles, callin' Baton Rouge

[Verse 2]
A replay of last night's events roll through my mind
Except a scene or two, erased by sweet red wine
And I see a truck stop sign ahead so I change lanes
I need a cup of coffee and a couple dollars change, callin' Baton Rouge

[Chorus]
Operator, won't you put me on through
I gotta send my love down to Baton Rouge
Hurry up, won't you put her on the line
I gotta talk to the girl just one more time

[Verse 3]
Hello, Samantha dear, I hope you're feelin' fine
And it won't be long until I'm with you all the time
But until then I'll spend my money up, right down to my last dime
Callin' Baton Rouge

[Chorus]
Operator, won't you put me on through
I gotta send my love down to Baton Rouge
Hurry up, won't you put her on the line
I gotta talk to the girl just one more time

[Outro]
Callin' Baton Rouge
Sweet Baton Rouge
My Baton Rouge
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"
Garth Brooks,Two Piña Coladas,"[Verse 1]
I was feeling the blues, I was watchin' the news
When this fella came on the TV
He said I'm tellin' you that science has proved
That heartaches are healed by the sea
That got me goin', without even knowin'
I packed right up and drove down
Now I'm on a roll and I swear to my soul
Tonight I'm gonna paint this town

[Chorus]
So bring me two piña coladas
I want one for each hand
Let's set sail with Captain Morgan
Oh, and never leave dry land
Hey, troubles I forgot 'em
I buried 'em in the sand
So bring me two piña coladas
She said goodbye to her good timin' man

[Verse 2]
Oh, now I've gotta say that the wind and the waves
And the moon winkin' down at me
Eases my mind, by leavin' behind
The heartaches that love often brings
Now I've got a smile that goes on for miles
With no inclination to roam
And I've gotta say that I think I've gotta stay
'Cause this is feelin' more and more like home

[Chorus]
So bring me two piña coladas
I gotta have one for each hand
Let's set sail with Captain Morgan
Oh, we'll never leave dry land
Hey, troubles I forgot 'em
I buried 'em in the sand
So bring me two piña coladas
She said goodbye to her good timin' man

[Chorus]
Bring... bring... bring me two piña coladas
I want one for each hand
Let's all set sail with Captain Morgan
Oh, and never leave dry land
Troubles I forgot 'em
I buried 'em in the sand
So bring me two piña coladas
And say hello to her good timin' man

[Outro]
Bring me two piña coladas
I gotta have one for each hand
Let's all set sail with Captain Morgan
And we will never leave dry land
Hey, troubles I forgot 'em
I buried 'em in the sand..."
Garth Brooks,Much Too Young (To Feel This Damn Old),"[Verse 1]
This old highway's gettin' longer
It seems there is no end in sight
To sleep would be best
But I just can't afford to rest
I gotta ride in Denver tomorrow night

[Verse 2]
I called the house but no one answered
For the last two weeks no one's been home
I guess she's through with me
To tell the truth I just can't see
What's kept the woman holdin' on this long

[Chorus]
And the white line's getting longer and the saddle's gettin' cold
An' I'm much too young to feel this damn old
All my cards are on the table, with no ace left in the hole
An' I'm much too young to feel this damn old

[Verse 3]
The competition's gettin' younger
Tougher broncs, you know I can't recall
A worn out tape of Chris LeDoux
Lonely women and bad booze
Seem to be the only friends I've left at all

[Chorus]
And the white line's gettin' longer and the saddle's gettin' cold
An' I'm much too young to feel this damn old
All my cards are on the table, with no ace left in the hole
An' I'm much too young to feel this damn old

[Outro]
Lord, I'm much too young to feel this damn old"
Garth Brooks,Whiskey to Wine,"[Verse 1: Garth Brooks]
Yeah she's nice, yeah she's pretty
And she's crazy about me
She's what every man's hoping to find
She's always a lady, and that's driving me crazy
'Cause after you it's like going
From whiskey to wine

[Chorus: Brooks and Trisha Yearwood]
Whiskey to wine
It's just not the same high
I miss the fire
The burning desire
We fought like we loved
And we loved all the time
We're no good together
But it's sure as hell better
Than going forever
From whiskey to wine

[Verse 2: Trisha Yearwood]
When I talk, he listens
He don't show up missing
He's patient, polite and refined
He's handsome, romantic
But the problem is damn it
That after you it's like going
From whiskey to wine

[Chorus: Brooks and Yearwood]
Whiskey to wine
It's just not the same high
I miss the fire
The burning desire
We fought like we loved
And we loved all the time
We're no good together
But it's sure as hell better
Than going forever
From whiskey to wine

It's probably best, we rejoin the rest
And try to have what they call a good time
And hope it's not showing, we're walking in knowing
That we're going from whiskey to wine"
Garth Brooks,Shameless,"[Verse 1]
Well, I'm shameless, when it comes to lovin' you
I'll do anything you want me to, I'll do anything at all
And I'm standin', here for all the world to see
Oh, baby, that's what's left of me, don't have very far to fall

[Verse 2]
You know, now, I'm not a man who's ever been
Insecure about the world I've been livin' in
I don't break easy, I have my pride
But if you need to be satisfied

[Chorus]
I'm shameless, oh, honey I don't have a prayer
Every time I see you standin' there, I go down upon my knees
And I'm changin', swore I'd never compromise
Oh, but you convinced me otherwise, I'll do anything you please

[Verse 3]
You see in all my life I've never found
What I couldn't resist, what I couldn't turn down
I can walk away from anyone I ever knew
But I can't walk away from you

[Bridge]
I have never let anything have this much control over me
I worked too hard to call my life my own
And I've made myself a world and it's worked so perfectly
But it's your world now, I can't refuse, I've never had so much to lose
Oh, I'm shameless

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
You know it should be easy for a man who's strong
To say he's sorry or admit when he's wrong
I've never lost anything I've ever missed
But I've never been in love like this
It's out of my hands

[Chorus]
I'm shameless, I don't have the power now
I don't want it anyhow, so I gotta let it go
Oh, I'm shameless, shameless as a man can be
You could make a total fool of me, I just wanted to you to know

[Outro]
Oh, I'm shameless
I just wanted you to know
Oh, I'm shameless
Oh, I'm down on my knees... shameless"
Garth Brooks,Ain’t Going Down (’Til The Sun Comes Up),"[Verse 1]
Six o'clock on Friday evenin'
Momma doesn't know she's leavin'
'Til she hears the screen door slammin'
Rubber squealin', gears a-jammin'
Local country station just a blarin' on the radio
Pick him up at seven and they're headin' to the rodeo
Momma's on the front porch screamin' out her warnin'
Girl you better get your red head back in bed before the mornin'

[Verse 2]
Nine o'clock the show is endin'
But the fun is just beginnin'
She knows he's anticipatin'
But she's gonna keep him waitin'
Grab a bite to eat and then they're headin' to the honky-tonk
But loud crowds and line dancin' just ain't what they really want
Drive out to the boondocks and park down by the creek
Hey, where it's George Strait 'til real late, dancin' cheek to cheek

[Chorus]
Ain't goin' down 'til the sun comes up
Ain't givin' in 'til they get enough
Goin' 'round the world in a pickup truck
Ain't goin' down 'til the sun comes up

[Bridge]
Ten 'til twelve is wine and dancin'
Midnight starts the hard romancin'
One o'clock that truck is rockin'
Two is comin', still no stoppin'
Break to check the clock at three
They're right on where they want to be
And four o'clock get up and goin'
Five o'clock that rooster's crowin'

[Chorus]
Yeah, they ain't goin' down 'til the sun comes up
Ain't givin' in 'til they get enough
Goin' 'round the world in a pickup truck
Ain't goin' down 'til the sun comes up

[Verse 4]
Six o'clock on Saturday
Her folks don't know his on his way
The stalls are clean, the horses fed
They say she's grounded 'til she's dead
Well, here he comes around the bend
Slowin' down, she's jumpin' in
Hey, mom, you're daughter's gone
And there they go again, hey

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Ain't goin' down 'til the sun comes up
Ain't givin' in 'til they get enough
Goin' 'round the world in a pickup truck
Ain't goin' down 'til the sun comes up"
Garth Brooks,The Beaches of Cheyenne,"[Verse 1]
They packed up all his buckles
And shipped his saddle to his dad
And by the way the house looked
She must have took it bad
The workers come on Monday
To fix the door and patch the wall
They say she just went crazy
The night she got the call

[Verse 2]
Well, he was up in Wyoming
And drew a bull no man could ride
He promised her he'd turn out
Well, it turned out that he lied
And all the dreams that they'd been livin'
In the California sand
Died right there beside him in Cheyenne

[Chorus 1]
They she just went crazy
Screamin' out his name
She ran out into the ocean
And to this day they claim
That if you go down by the water
You'll see her footprints in the sand
'Cause every night she walks
The beaches of Cheyenne

[Verse 3]
They never found her body
Just her diary by the bed
It told about the fight they had
And the words that she had said
When he told her he was ridin'
She said, ""Then I don't give a damn
If you never come back from Cheyenne""

[Chorus 1]
They she just went crazy
Screamin' out his name
She ran out into the ocean
And to this day they claim
That if you go down by the water
You'll see her footprints in the sand
'Cause every night she walks
The beaches of Cheyenne

[Chorus 2]
Nobody can explain it
Some say she's still alive
They've even claimed they've seen her
On the shoreline late at night
'Cause if you go down by the water
You'll see her footprints in the sand
'Cause every night she walks
The beaches of Cheyenne

[Outro]
Yes, every night she walks
The beaches of Cheyenne"
Garth Brooks,Belleau Wood,"[Verse 1]
Oh, the snowflakes fell in silence
Over Belleau Wood that night
For a Christmas truce had been declared
By both sides of the fight
As we lay there in our trenches
The silence broke in two
By a German soldier singing
A song that we all knew

[Verse 2]
Though I did not know the language
The song was ""Silent Night""
Then I heard my buddy whisper
""All is calm and all is bright""
Then the fear and doubt surrounded me
Because I'd die if I was wrong
But I stood up in my trench
And I began to sing along

[Bridge 1]
Then across the frozen battlefield
Another's voice joined in
Until one by one each man became
A singer of the hymn

[Verse 3]
Then I thought that I was dreaming
For right there in my sight
Stood the German soldier
'Neath the falling flakes of white
And he raised his hand and smiled at me
As if he seemed to say
""Here's hoping we both live to see us
Find a better way""

[Bridge 2]
Then the devil's clock struck midnight
And the skies lit up again
And the battlefield where heaven stood
Was blown to hell again

[Verse 4]
But for just one fleeting moment
The answer seemed so clear
Heaven's not beyond the clouds
It's just beyond the fear
No, heaven's not beyond the clouds
It's for us, to find it, here"
Garth Brooks,We Shall Be Free,"[Intro]
This ain't comin' from no prophet
Just an ordinary man
When I close my eyes I see, the way this world shall be
When we all walk hand in hand

[Verse 1]
When the last child cries for a crust of bread
When the last man dies for just words that he said
When there's shelter over the poorest head
We shall be free

[Verse 2]
When the last thing we notice is the color of skin
And the first thing we look for is the beauty within
When the skies and the oceans are clean again
Then we shall be free

[Chorus: Garth Brooks, Garth Brooks & Choir]
We shall be free
We shall be free
Stand straight, walk proud
'Cause we shall be free

[Verse 3]
When we're free to love anyone we choose
When this world's big enough for all different views
When we all can worship from our own kind of pew
Then we shall be free, yeah

[Chorus: Garth Brooks, Garth Brooks & Choir]
We shall be free
We shall be free
Have a little faith, hold out
'Cause we shall be free

[Bridge: Garth Brooks, Garth Brooks & Choir]
And when money talks for the very last time
And nobody walks a step behind
When there's only one race and that's mankind
Then we shall be free

[Chorus 1: Garth Brooks, Choir, & Garth Brooks & Choir]
We shall be free
We shall be free
Stand straight
Walk proud
Have a little faith
Hold out
'Cause we shall be free

[Chorus 1: Garth Brooks, Choir, & Garth Brooks & Choir]
We shall be free
We shall be free
Stand straight
Stand straight
Have a little faith
Walk proud
'Cause we shall be free

[Outro: Garth Brooks, Garth Brooks & Choir]
We shall be free
We shall be free
Stand straight, walk proud
'Cause we shall be free"
Garth Brooks,All Day Long,"[Verse 1]
Somebody's gotta start the weekend
Somebody's got to unwind
Somebody's gotta find that honky-tonk
Out on the county line
With pretty things and a band that swings
That gets 'em all out on the floor
And if we're gonna get the party started
Somebody's gotta swing them doors

[Chorus]
Somebody's gotta feed that jukebox
Somebody's gotta drink that beer
Somebody's gotta get all rowdy
And raise some hell in here
Somebody's gotta dance with the women
Spin 'em to a country song
I can do this nightlife all day long

[Verse 2]
Somebody's gonna need a shoulder
When that sad song plays
Somebody's gonna need to hold her
Tell her it's okay
Just let her know to let it go
And then she's gonna have some fun
If she needs some help gettin' over him
Somebody's gotta get it done

[Chorus]
Somebody's gotta shoot that whiskey
Somebody gotta bust that rack
Somebody's gotta play that country
That ain't ever comin' back
If home is where the heart is
Then I'm right where I belong
I can do this nightlife all day long

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
Somebody's gotta go the distance
Somebody's gotta call last round
Somebody's gotta turn the lights on
And shut this ol' bar down
When mornin' comes you'll find someone
With a headache and a grin
You know Saturday night is comin'
Somebody's gotta go again

[Chorus]
Somebody's gotta feed that jukebox
Somebody's gotta hold my beer
Somebody's gotta get a little crazy
And raise some hell in here
Somebody's gotta spend that paycheck
'Til the money's gone
I can do this nightlife all day long

[Outro]
I can do this nightlife (Let me hear you say) all day long
(Yeah!)"
Charley Pride,Kiss An Angel Good Mornin’,"[Verse 1]
Whenever I chance to meet
Some old friends on the street
They wonder, ""How does a man get to be this way?""
I've always got a smiling face
Anytime and any place
And every time they ask me why
I just smile and say

[Chorus]
""You've got to
Kiss an angel good mornin'
And let her know you think about her when you're gone
Kiss an angel good mornin'
And love her like the devil when you get back home""

[Verse 2]
Well, people may try to guess
The secret of a happiness
But some of them never learn, it's a simple thing
The secret I'm speakin' of
Is a woman and a man in love
And the answer is in this song
That I always sing

[Chorus]
You've got to
Kiss an angel good mornin'
And let her know you think about her when you're gone
Kiss an angel good mornin'
And love her like the devil when you get back home
Kiss an angel good mornin'
And let her know you think about her when you're gone
Kiss an angel good mornin'
And love her like the devil when you get back home"
Charley Pride,All I Have to Offer You (Is Me),"[Verse 1]
Before you take another step, there's something you should know
About the years ahead and how they'll be
You'll be living in a world where roses hardly ever grow
'Cause all I have to offer you is me

[Chorus]
There'll be no mansion waiting on the hill with crystal chandeliers
And there'll be no fancy clothes for you to wear
Everything I have is standing here in front of you to see
All I have to offer you is me

[Verse 2]
Sweetheart I'll give you all my love in every way I can
But make sure that's what you want while you're still free
The only gold I have for you is in this wedding band
'Cause all I have to offer you is me

[Chorus]"
Charley Pride,(I’m So) Afraid of Losing You Again,"[Verse 1]
Sometimes I want to throw my arms around you
Then I tremble at the thought of giving in
Because I know how much it cost to love you
And I'm so afraid of losing you again

[Chorus]
Being close to you revives the sorrow
That wakes me up and tells me I can't win
I'd love to wake up in your arms tomorrow
But I'm so afraid of losing you again

[Verse 2]
If heaven were to hear my heart's confession
Wanting you would be my greatest sin
But I'm glad that you're no longer my possession
'Cause I'm so afraid of losing you again

[Chorus]
Being close to you revives the sorrow
That wakes me up and tells me I can't win
I'd love to wake up in your arms tomorrow
But I'm so afraid of losing you again
But I'm so afraid of losing you again"
Charley Pride,Time Out For Jesus,"Take time out for Jesus He took time for you!

Take a little time in the mornin
And You'll feel better all day
Take a little time for Jesus
To get down on your knees and prey

He took the time to die on the cross
So all the soles couldn't be lost
If you find your self slippin and the pain to do
Take time out for Jesus He took time for you

Sometimes you may be in a hurry
You have so many things to do
So don't forget about jesus
Remember he didn't forget you

He took the time to die on the cross
So all the soles couldn't be lost
If you find your self slippin and the pain to do
Take time out for Jesus He took time for you

Take time out for Jesus He took time for you!"
Charley Pride,"Lord, Build Me A Cabin In Glory","Many years I've been looking for a place to call home
But I've failed here to find it, so I must travel on;
I don't care for fine mansions on earth's sinking sand
Lord, build me a cabin in the corner of glory land

Lord build me just a cabin in the corner of Gloryland
In the shade of his tree of life that it may ever stand
Where I can hear the angels and shake Jesus' hand
Lord build me a cabin in the corner of Gloryland

Listen Lord I'm not askin' to live in the midst
For I know that I'm not worthy of such splendor as this
When I ask him for mercy while humbly I stand
Lord build me a cabin in the corner of Gloryland

Yes build me just a cabin in the corner of Gloryland
In the shade of his tree of life that it may ever stand
Where I can hear the angels and shake Jesus' hand
Lord build me a cabin in the corner of Gloryland

I've many dear loved one's who've gone on this way
On the grapevine of mournin' shall I hear them all say
Come and join in our singin' and play in our band
Lord build me a cabin in the corner of gloryland

Yes build me just a cabin in the corner of Gloryland
In the shade of his tree of life that it may ever stand
Where I can hear the angels and shake Jesus' hand
Lord build me a cabin in the corner of Gloryland"
Charley Pride,Crystal Chandelier,"[Chorus]
Oh the crystal chandeliers light up the paintings on your wall
The marble statuettes are standing stately in the hall
But will the timely crowd that has you laughing loud help you dry your tears
When the new wears off of your crystal chandeliers?

[Verse 1]
I never did fit in too well with the folks you knew
And it's plain to see that the likes of me don't fit with you
So you traded me for the gaiety of the well to do
And you turned away from the love I offered you

[Chorus]
Oh the crystal chandeliers light up the paintings on your wall
The marble statuettes are standing stately in the hall
But will the timely crowd that has you laughing loud help you dry your tears
When the new wears off of your crystal chandeliers?

[Verse 2]
I see your picture in the news most every day
You're the chosen girl of the social world so the stories say
But a paper smile only lasts a while then it fades away
And the love we knew will come home to you some day

[Chorus]
Oh the crystal chandeliers light up the paintings on your wall
The marble statuettes are standing stately in the hall
But will the timely crowd that has you laughing loud help you dry your tears
When the new wears off of your crystal chandeliers?

[Outro]
When the new wears off of your crystal chandeliers"
Charley Pride,The Snakes Crawl at Night,"Oh the snakes crawl at night, that's what they say
When the sun goes down, then the snakes will play

I watched that car pull right up into my driveway
Saw a shadow slip away from my house
So I hurried straight and looked in her room
And I found out that it was my loving spouse
Oh, the snakes crawl at night, that's what they say

So I waited in the shadows until morning
And the gun I held was trembling in my hand
No, I did not plan to give them any warning
Cause the devil on my shoulder had command

Oh, the snakes crawl at night, that's what they say
When the sun goes down, then the snakes will play

Oh the trial in a little while was over
And they sentenced me to die right away
But before I leave this courtroom please, Your Honor
There's something more that I would like to say

All the snakes crawl at night, that's what they say
When the sun goes down, then the snakes will play"
Charley Pride,I’m Just Me,"Down at the railroad station there's people gettin' on
Some are a goin' north some are a goin' south I'm just goin' to be gone
Some people are born to be takers others just wanna give
Some people live just to love but I just love to live
For I was just born to be exactly what you see
Nothing more or less I'm not the worst or the best
I just try to be exactly what you see today and every day I'm just me

When people say their life is rough I wonder compared to what
Some are wantin' more and more's gettin' less I just want what I've got
Some wanna live on a hill others down by the sea
Some wanna live inside high walls I just wanna live free
For I was just born...
Oh I was just born to be exactly what you see today and every day I'm just me"
Charley Pride,I Don’t Know Why I Love But I Do,"I don't know why I love you but I do
I don't know why I cry so but I do
I only know I'm lonely and that I want you only
I don't know why I love you but I do

I can't sleep nights because I feel so restless
I don't know what to do, I feel so helpless
And since you've went away, I cry both night and day
I don't know why I love you but I do

My days have been so lonely
My nights have been so blue
I don't know how I spend it, but I do

Each night I sit alone and tell myself
That I will fall in love with someone else
I guess I'm wasting time but I've got to clear my mind
I don't know why I love you but I do

My days have been so lonely
My nights have been so blue
I don't know how I spend it, but I do

Each night I sit alone and tell myself
That I will fall in love with someone else
I guess I'm wasting time but I've got to clear my mind
I don't know why I love you
I don't know why I love you
I don't know why I love you but I do
I do"
Charley Pride,You’re Still the Only One I’ll Ever Love,"Time has passed and things have changed
You've gone your way I've gone mine
On the surface it's all over but beneath the surface
You're still on my mind

'Cause you're still the only one I'll ever love
Forget the hours, forget the miles
Your lips are still the lips I'm dreaming of
And you're still the only one I'll ever love

--- Instrumental ---

All my thoughts of you are good ones
Happy hours that just flew by
You were always someone special
And you'll be my someone special till I die

'Cause you're still the only one I'll ever love
Treasured mem'ry of treasured time
Your lips are still the lips I'm dreaming of
And you're still the only one I'll ever love
Yes you're still the only one I'll ever love
Treasured mem'ry of treasured time
Your lips are still the lips I'm dreaming of
And you're still the only one I'll ever love"
Charley Pride,Is Anybody Goin’ to San Antone,"[Verse 1]
Rain drippin' off the brim of my hat
Sure is cold today
Here I am walking down 66
Wish she hadn't done me that way
Sleeping under a table in a roadside park
A man could wake up dead
But it sure seems warmer than it did
Sleepin' in our king-size bed

[Chorus]
Is anybody goin to San Antone
Or Phoenix, Arizona?
Any place is alright as long as I
Can forget I've ever known her

[Verse 2]
Wind whippin' down the neck of my shirt
Like I ain't got nothin' on
But I'd rather fight the wind and rain
Than what I've been fightin' at home
Yonder comes a truck with the US mail
People writin' letters back home
Tomorrow she'll probably want me back
But I'll still be just as gone

[Chorus]
Is anybody goin to San Antone
Or Phoenix, Arizona?
Any place is alright as long as I
Can forget I've ever known her"
Charley Pride,I Don’t Deserve A Mansion,"I was lost but Jesus saved me
He gave his life on Calvary's tree
And though I failed him
He still loves me
Through his grace I've been set free

I know I don't deserve a mansion
'Cause I was born a sinful man
No, I don't deserve a mansion
But Jesus built a home for me in glory land

It was our sin that he died for
For all mankind he paid the price
Who are we that he should love us
Enough to give his life

I know I don't deserve a mansion
'Cause I was born a sinful man
No, I don't deserve a mansion
But Jesus built a home for me in glory land"
Charley Pride,The Most Beautiful Girl in the World,"Hey, did you happen to see the most beautiful girl in the world?
And if you did was she crying, cryin?
Hey, if you happen to see the most beautiful girl, that walked out on me
Tell her I'm sorry, tell her I need my baby
Oh, won't you tell her, that I love her
I woke up this morning, and realized what I had done
I stood alone in the cold gray dawn
And I knew I'd lost my morning sun
I lost my head and I said some things
Now come the heartaches that the morning brings
I know I'm wrong and I couldn't see
I let my world slip away from me
Hey, did you happen to see the most beautiful girl in the world?
And if you did was she crying, cryin?
Hey, if you happen to see the most beautiful girl, that walked out on me
Tell her I'm sorry, tell her I need my baby
Oh, won't you tell her, that I love her

Did you happen to see the most beautiful girl in the world?
And if you did was she crying, cryin?
Hey, if you happen to see the most beautiful girl, that walked out on me
Tell her I'm sorry, tell her I need my baby
Oh, won't you tell her, that I love her

Charley Pride,Just Between You And Me,"[Verse 1]
So I feel so blue sometimes I wanna die
And so I've got a broken heart so what
They say that time will heal all wounds in mice and men
And I know that someday I'll forget and love again

[Chorus]
But just between you and me I've got my doubts about it
'Cause just between you and me you're too much to forget

[Verse 2]
So I lost the only girl I ever loved
And so I've never felt so low so what
I'll just tell myself each time I wanna cry
That someday time will dry the teardrops from my eyes

[Chorus]
But just between you and me, I'm not so sure about it
'Cause just between you and me, you're too much to forget
You're too much to forget"

I wanna share your life
Every minute, every day and night

Remember someone loves you, honey
No matter what
Just be my girl
Someone loves you, honey
More than anything in the world

I just want you to be my girl
Someone loves you, honey
More than anything in the world"
Charley Pride,Standing in My Way,"[Verse 1]
I'm always there forever, I am
There between what I'm reaching for and the fingers on my hand
Blocking myself with things like words I shouldn't say
It seems I'm always standing in my way
Like the time I told you a lie
And I became the wall that stood between your heart and mine
I apologize but the truth is the truth don't ever fade
It seems I'm always standing in my way

[Chorus]
My way is the hard way, I guess
Guys like me say no when we mean yes
I'd step aside if I could 'cause I live for your embrace
But it seems I'm always standing in my way

[Verse 2]
Why you stand beside me, I don't know
There's so many places a girl like you could go
I hope you see enough in me to make you wanna stay
'Cause it seems I'm always standing in my way

[Chorus]
My way is the hard way, I guess
Guys like me say no when we mean yes
I'd step aside if I could 'cause I live for your embrace
But it seems I'm always standing in my way

I'd step aside if I could 'cause I live for your embrace
But it seems I'm always standing in my way

There between what I'm reaching for and the fingers on my hand"
Charley Pride,Be Grateful,"Blind man can't see flowers growing in the garden
Crippled man can't walk places where he wants to go
Man that can't talk things he will never say
And a man that can't hear words he will never know

So if you can see and if you can walk
If you can hear and if you can talk
Then be grateful be grateful for what you've got
Cause for some folks these things would mean a lot

I once heard a man say all he wanted out of life was money
To be the richest man have wealth and fame untold
But he could see he could walk he could hear and he could talk
And for some folks this would mean much more than gold

So if you can see and if you can walk
If you can hear and if you can talk
Then be grateful be grateful for what you've got
Cause for some folks these things would mean a lot

So if you can see and if you can walk
If you can hear and if you can talk
Then be grateful be grateful for what you've got
Cause for some folks these things would mean a lot
Cause for some folks these things would mean a lot"
Charley Pride,Just for the Love of It,"I remember walking with my daddy through his weathered fields of grain
But he wouldn't curse the sun or give up on the rain
I ask him why don't you sell this place
Move to town you'll have money to burn
He said son you don't understand I don't do this for what I earn

Oh it's just for the love of it that's all the reason you need
What more could anyone ask  satisfaction  guaranteed
Don't chase rainbows or your pot of gold you'll always have enough
If you'll do everything you do  just for the love

Drove on back to Nashville thinking
That my daddy's words couldn't be true
How could a man keep pouring out his heart just to get it broke into
Then I looked around my two bare rooms and realized he wasn't wrong
And picked up this old guitar and poured out another song

Oh it's just for the love of it that's all the reason you need
What more could anyone ask  satisfaction  guaranteed
Don't chase rainbows or your pot of gold you'll always have enough
If you'll do everything you do  just for the love

The next summer I walked with my daddy
Through his golden fields of grain
Giving thanks to heaven above for the sunshine and the rain
Just leave it in the good Lords hands He always will provide
And you'll know what His reason is you don't even have ask Him why

He'll say just for the love of it that's all the reason you need
What more could anyone ask  satisfaction  guaranteed
Don't chase rainbows or your pot of gold you'll always have enough
If you'll do everything you do  just for the love=

Don't chase rainbows or your pot of gold you'll always have enough
If you'll do everything you do  just for the love"
Charley Pride,Kaw-Liga,"Kaw-Liga was a wooden Indian standin' by the door
He fell in love with an Indian maiden over in the antique store
Kaw-Liga well he just stood there and never let it show
So she could never answer yes or no
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga well he never got a kiss
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga he don't know what he missed
Is it any wonder that his face is red Kaw-Liga that poor ol' wooden head

He always wore his Sunday feathers and held a tomahawk
The maiden wore her beads and braids and hoped someday he'd talk
Kaw-Liga well he stood there as lonely as can be
Cause his heart was an ol' pine knoty tree
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga...

And then one day a wealthy customer bought the Indian maid
He took her oh so far away but ol' Kaw-Liga stayed
Well he stood there and never let it show so she could never answer yes or no
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga..."
Charley Pride,He Took My Place,"There was a man more than a man
Called Jesus Christ of Galilee
There was a place where Jesus prayed
A place that’s called Gethsemane

There on a hill called Calvary
There stood a cross of agony
Nailed to that cross where I should be
He took my place at Calvary

Now I'm a child of royalty
And even angels envy me
My Jesus cared so much for me
He took my place at Calvary

Christ Jesus lives He lives today
From sin and debt He set me free
Now hand in hand each place I go
My Jesus Christ He walks with me

And when I ask how could it be
That Jesus cared so much for me
The answer comes so tenderly
He took my place at Calvary

Now I'm a child of royalty
And even angels envy me
My Jesus cared so much for me
He took my place at Calvary

And now my Lord the son of God
I share with everyone I see
I give my best my all to Him
Because He gives so much to me

Now if His own you’ll wanna be
Come join His royal family
Let your heart sing joyfully
He took my place at Calvary

Now I'm a child of royalty
And even angels envy me
My Jesus cared so much for me
He took my place at Calvary"
Charley Pride,Does My Ring Hurt Your Finger,"Does my ring hurt your finger
When you go out at night?
When I bought if for you darling
It seemed to fit just right
Should I take it to the jeweler
So it won't fit so tight?
Does my ring hurt your finger
When you go out at night?

Did you enjoy yourself last night dear
How was the show?
You know I don't mind it
When you go
I understand we all need time alone
But why do you always leave your ring at home?

Does my ring hurt your finger
When you're away from me?
I'm so proud when you wear it
For all the world to see
Should I take it to the jeweler
So it won't fit so tight?
Does my ring hurt your finger
When you go out at night?

Does my ring hurt your finger
When you go out at night?"
Charley Pride,"Jesus, Don’t Give Up On Me","Jesus I know I neglected to do
The little things the big things you wanted me to
I've let you down Jesus that's not hard to see
Jesus oh Jesus don't give up on me
Stand by me Jesus forgive me somehow
If there's any hope left don't leave me now
I might be worth savin' I'm trying to be
Jesus oh Jesus don't give up on me
It's late I know and I made you wait
But don't turn the light out don't lock the gate
Forgiveness and patience that's all I need
Jesus oh Jesus don't give up on me
Stand by me Jesus forgive me somehow..."
Charley Pride,Sunshiny Day,"If I wake up in the morning when I look outside it's storming
And it seems the world is covered by clouds of grey
I don't really mind the weather baby long as we're together
In my heart it's a gonna be a sunshiny day
I don't ever pay attention about the weatherman may mention
I don't even care about what he's got to say
I surely care now if it showers when you got a love like ours
Every day is a gonna be a sunshiny day
And I'll have a sunshine day every day that I live
The sweet love that you give will make it shine
And I'll I have a sunshiny day in my heart from now on just as long as you are mine

So let the howlin' wind start blowin' let the raindrops keep on flowin'
Everytime they touch my face just kiss them away
Even with the clouds above me long as I've got you to love me
Every day is a gonna be a sunshiny day
And I'll have a sunshiny day...
So let the howlin' wind start blowin' let the raindrops keep on flowin'
Every day is a gonna be a sunshiny day yes every day is a gonna be a sunshiny day"
Charley Pride,In Jesus’ Name I Pray,"Father give me strength, to do what I must do
Father give me courage, to say what I must say
Let thy spirit move me, I'm nothing on my own
Father stand by me, I cannot stand alone
In Jesus' Name I pray

Father open up my eyes to your wonders all around
Father let me see the good & beauty of this day
Fill my heart with love for my fellow man
And if I'm tempted Father
Father stay my hand
In Jesus' name I pray

Father help me through the troubled days that lie ahead
Let your light shine before me, that I may find the way
Don't let me stumble Father, or fall beneath my load
Father guide my footsteps, hold me to the road
In Jesus' Name I Pray

Let not hunger be my guide, nor fear be my master
Father let not envy be a part of me in any way
Father search my soul, take away my fear & doubt
Any smallness that you find there, Father cast it out
In Jesus' Name I pray"
Charley Pride,Before I Met You,"I thought I had seen pretty girls in my time but that was before I met you
I never saw one that I wanted for mine but that was before I met you
I thought I was swinging the world by the tail I thought I could never be blue
I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved but that was before I met you

I wanted to ramble and always be free but that was before I met you
I said that no woman could ever hold me but that was before I met you
I thought I was swinging...

They tell me I must reap just what I have sown but darling I hope it's not true
For once I made plans about living alone but that was before I met you
I thought I was swinging...
But that was before I met you"
George Strait,Amarillo by Morning,"[Verse 1]
Amarillo by morning, up from San Antone
Everything that I got is just what I've got on
When that sun is high in that Texas sky
I'll be buckin' at the county fair
Amarillo by morning
Amarillo, I'll be there

[Verse 2]
They took my saddle in Houston, broke my leg in Santa Fe
Lost my wife and a girlfriend, somewhere along the way
Well, I'll be lookin' for eight when they pull that gate
And I hope that judge ain't blind
Amarillo by morning
Amarillo's on my mind

[Verse 3]
Amarillo by morning, up from San Antone
Everything that I got is just what I've got on
I ain't got a dime, but what I got is mine
I ain't rich, but Lord, I'm free
Amarillo by morning
Amarillo is where I'll be

[Outro]
Amarillo by morning
Amarillo is where I'll be"
George Strait,All My Ex’s Live in Texas,"[Chorus]
All my exes live in Texas
And Texas is the place I'd dearly love to be
But all my exes live in Texas
And that's why I hang my hat in Tennessee

[Verse 1]
Rosanna's down in Texarkana
Wanted me to push her broom
And sweet Eileen's in Abilene
She forgot I hung the moon
And Allison's in Galveston
Somehow lost her sanity
And Dimples, who now lives in Temple's
Got the law looking for me

[Chorus]
All my exes live in Texas
And Texas is the place I'd dearly love to be
But all my exes live in Texas
And that's why I hang my hat in Tennessee

[Verse 2]
I remember that old Frio River
Where I learned to swim
But it brings to mind another time
Where I wore my welcome thin
By transcendental meditation
I go there each night
But I always come back to myself
Long before daylight

[Chorus]
All my exes live in Texas
And Texas is the place I'd dearly love to be
But all my exes live in Texas
Therefore I reside in Tennessee

[Outro]
Some folks think I'm hiding
It's been rumored that I died
But I'm alive and well in Tennessee"
George Strait,Here for a Good Time,"[Verse 1]
I'm not gonna lay around and whine and moan
'Cause somebody done done me wrong
Don't think for a minute that I'm gonna sit around
And sing some old sad song

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I believe it's half full, not a half empty glass
Every day I wake up knowing it could be my last

[Chorus]
I ain't here for a long time, I'm here for a good time
So bring on the sunshine, to hell with the red wine
Pour me some moonshine
When I'm gone, put it in stone, ""He left nothing behind""
I ain't here for a long time, I'm here for a good time

[Verse 2]
Folks are always dreaming 'bout what they'd like to do
But I like to do just what I like
I'll take the chance, dance the dance
It might be wrong but then again it might be right

[Pre-Chorus 2]
There's no way of knowing what tomorrow brings
Life's too short to waste it, I say bring on anything

[Chorus]
I ain't here for a long time, I'm here for a good time
So bring on the sunshine, to hell with the red wine
Pour me some moonshine
When I'm gone, put it in stone, ""He left nothing behind""
I ain't here for a long time, I'm here for a good time
I ain't here for a long time, I'm here for a good time"
George Strait,Troubadour,"[Verse 1]
I still feel twenty-five most of the time
I still raise a little Cain with the boys
Honky Tonks and pretty women
But Lord I'm still right there with 'em
Singing above the crowd and the noise

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel like Jesse James
Still trying to make a name
Knowing nothing's gonna change what I am
I was a young troubadour
When I rode in on a song
And I'll be an old troubadour when I'm gone

[Verse 2]
Well, the truth about a mirror
Is that a damned old mirror
Don't really tell the whole truth
It don't show what's deep inside
Or read between the lines
And it's really no reflection of my youth

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel like Jesse James
Still trying to make a name
Knowing nothing's gonna change what I am
I was a young troubadour
When I rode in on a song
I'll be an old troubadour when I'm gone
I was a young troubadour
When I rode in on a song
And I'll be an old troubadour when I'm gone

[Outro]
I'll be an old troubadour when I'm gone"
George Strait,I Cross My Heart,"[Verse 1]
Our love is unconditional, we knew it from the start
I see it in your eyes, you can feel it from my heart
From here on after let's stay the way we are right now
And share all the love and laughter that a lifetime will allow

[Chorus]
I cross my heart and promise to
Give all I've got to give to make all your dreams come true
In all the world you'll never find
A love as true as mine

[Verse 2]
You will always be the miracle that makes my life complete
And as long as there's a breath in me, I'll make yours just as sweet
As we look into the future, it's as far as we can see
So let's make each tomorrow be the best that it can be

[Chorus]
I cross my heart and promise to
Give all I've got to give to make all your dreams come true
In all the world you'll never find
A love as true as mine

[Bridge]
And if along the way we find a day it starts to storm
You've got the promise of my love to keep you warm

[Outro]
In all the world you'll never find
A love as true as mine
A love as true as mine"
George Strait,Check Yes or No,"[Verse 1]
It started way back in third grade
I used to sit beside Emmylou Hayes
A pink dress, a matching bow and her pony tail
She kissed me on the school bus, but told me not to tell

[Verse 2]
Next day I chased her 'round the playground
Across the monkey bars, to the merry-go-round
And Emmylou got caught passing me a note
Before the teacher took it, I read what she wrote

[Chorus]
""Do you love me, do you wanna be my friend?
And if you do
Well then don't be afraid to take me by the hand
If you want to
I think this is how love goes, check yes or no""

[Verse 3]
Now we're grown up and she's my wife
Still like two kids with stars in our eyes
Ain't much changed, I still chase Emmylou
Up and down the hall, around the bed in our room

[Verse 4]
Last night I took her out in a white limousine
Twenty years together, she still gets to me
Can't believe it's been that long ago
When we got started with just a little note

[Chorus]
""Do you love me, do you wanna be my friend?
And if you do
Well then don't be afraid to take me by the hand
If you want to
I think this is how love goes, check yes or no""

[Chorus]
""Do you love me, do you wanna be my friend?
And if you do
Well then don't be afraid to take me by the hand
If you want to
I think this is how love goes, check yes or no""

[Outro]
Check yes or no
Check yes or no
Check yes or no
Check yes or no"
George Strait,Run,"If there's a plane or a bus leaving Dallas
I hope you're on it
If there's a train moving fast down the tracks
I hope you caught it

Cause I swear out there ain't where you ought to be
So catch a ride, catch a cab
Don't you know I miss you bad
But don't you walk to me

Baby run, cut a path across the blue skies
Straight in a straight line
You can't get here fast enough

Find a truck and fire it up
Lean on the gas and off the clutch
Leave Dallas in the dust
I need you in a rush
So baby run

If you ain't got a suit case
Get a box or an old brown paper sack
And pack it light or pack it heavy
Take a truck, take a Chevy
Baby just come back

There's a shortcut to the highway out of town
Why don't you take it
Don't let that speed limit slow you down
Go on and break it

Baby run
Oh baby run
Baby run"
George Strait,Carrying Your Love with Me,"[Verse 1]
Baby all I got is this beat up leather bag
And everything I own don't fill up half
But don't you worry about the way I pack
All I care about is getting back real soon
A goodbye kiss is all I need from you

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm carrying your love with me
West Virginia down to Tennessee
I'll be moving with the good Lord's speed
Carrying your love with me
It's my strength for holding on
Every minute that I have to be gone
I'll have everything I ever need
Carrying your love with me

[Verse 2]
On a lonely highway, stuck out in the rain
Darling all I have to do is speak your name
The clouds roll back and the waters part
The sun starts shining in my heart for you
You're right there in everything I do

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm carrying your love with me
West Virginia down to Tennessee
I'll be moving with the good Lord's speed
Carrying your love with me
It's my strength for holding on
Every minute that I have to be gone
I'll have everything I'll ever need
I'm carrying your love with me

[Outro]
I'm carrying your love with me
West Virginia down to Tennessee
I'll be moving with the good Lord's speed
Carrying your love with me"
George Strait,I Can Still Make Cheyenne,"[Verse 1]
Her telephone rang 'bout a quarter to nine
She heard his voice on the other end of the line
She wondered what was wrong this time
She never knew what his calls might bring
With a cowboy like him it could be anything
And she always expected the worst in the back of her mind

[Verse 2]
He said, ""It's cold out here and I'm all alone
I didn't make the short go again and I'm coming home
I know I've been away too long
I never got a chance to write or call
And I know this rodeo has been hard on us all
But I'll be home soon and honey is there something wrong?""

[Chorus]
She said, ""Don't bother coming home
By the time you get here I'll be long gone
There's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man.""
He said, ""I'm sorry it's come down to this
There's so much about you that I'm gonna miss
But it's alright baby, if I hurry I can still make Cheyenne
Gotta go now baby, if I hurry I can still make Cheyenne

[Verse 3]
He left that phone dangling off the hook
Then slowly turned around and gave it one last look
Then he just walked away
He aimed his truck toward that Wyoming line
With a little luck he could still get there in time
And in that Cheyenne wind he could still hear her say

[Chorus]
She said, ""Don't bother coming home
By the time you get here I'll be long gone
There's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man.""
He said, ""I'm sorry it's come down to this
There's so much about you that I'm gonna miss
But it's alright baby, if I hurry I can still make Cheyenne
Gotta go now baby, if I hurry I can still make Cheyenne

[Outro]
She never knew what his calls might bring
With a cowboy like him it could be anything
And she always expected the worst in the back of her mind"
George Strait,The Chair,"[Verse 1]
Well, excuse me
But I think you've got my chair
No, that one is not taken
I don't mind if you sit here, I'll be glad to share
Yeah, it's usually packed here on Friday nights
Oh, if you don't mind, could I talk you out of a light?

[Verse 2]
Well, thank you, could I drink you a buy?
Oh, listen to me, what I mean is can I buy you a drink?
Anything you please
Oh, you're welcome, well, I don't think I caught your name
Are you waiting for someone to meet you here?
Well, that makes two of us, glad you came

[Verse 3]
No, I don't know the name of the band, but they're good
Aren't they, would you like to dance?
Yeah, I like this song too, it reminds me of you and me
Baby, do you think there is a chance
That later on I could drive you home?
No, I do not mind at all
Oh, I like you too, and to tell you the truth
That was not my chair after all
[Outro]
Oh, I like you too, and to tell you the truth
That was not my chair after all"
George Strait,Ocean Front Property,"[Verse 1]
If you leave me, I won't miss you
And I won't ever take you back
Girl, your memory won't ever haunt me
'Cause I don't love you, and now, if you'll buy that

[Chorus]
I got some ocean front property in Arizona
From my front porch you can see the sea
I got some ocean front property in Arizona
If you'll buy that, I'll throw the Golden Gate in free

[Verse 2]
I don't worship the ground you walk on
I never have, and that's a fact
I won't follow or try to find you
'Cause I don't love you, and now, if you'll buy that

[Chorus]
I got some ocean front property in Arizona
From my front porch you can see the sea
I got some ocean front property in Arizona
If you'll buy that, I'll throw the Golden Gate in free
I got some ocean front property in Arizona
From my front porch you can see the sea
I got some ocean front property in Arizona
If you'll buy that, I'll throw the Golden Gate in free

[Outro]
Yeah, if you'll buy that, I'll throw the Golden Gate in free"
George Strait,"Love Without End, Amen","[Verse 1]
I got sent home from school one day with a shiner on my eye
Fighting was against the rules and it didn't matter why
When dad got home I told that story just like I'd rehearsed
Then stood there on those trembling knees and waited for the worst

[Chorus]
And he said, ""Let me tell you a secret about a father's love
A secret that my daddy said was just between us""
He said, ""Daddies don't just love their children every now and then
It's a love without end, amen""
It's a love without end, amen

[Verse 2]
When I became a father in the spring of '81
There was no doubt that stubborn boy was just like my father's son
And when I thought my patience had been tested to the end
I took my daddy's secret and I passed it on to him

[Chorus]
I said, ""Let me tell you a secret about a father's love
A secret that my daddy said was just between us""
I said, ""Daddies don't just love their children every now and then
It's a love without end, amen""
It's a love without end, amen

[Verse 3]
Last night I dreamed I died and stood outside those pearly gates
When suddenly I realized there must be some mistake
If they know half the things I've done, they'll never let me in
And then somewhere from the other side, I heard these words again

[Chorus]
And they said, ""Let me tell you a secret about a father's love
A secret that my daddy said was just between us""
""You see, daddies don't just love their children every now and then
It's a love without end, amen""
It's a love without end, amen"
George Strait,I Saw God Today,"[Verse 1]
Just walked down the street to the coffee shop
Had to take a break
I've been by her side for eighteen hours straight
Saw a flower growing in the middle of the sidewalk
Pushing up through the concrete
Like it was planted right there for me to see

[Pre-Chorus]
The flashing lights
The honking horns
All seem to fade away
But in the shadow of the hospital
At 5:08
I saw God today

[Chorus]
I've been to church
I've read the book
I know He's here
But I don't look
Near as often as I should
Yeah, I know I should
His fingerprints are everywhere
I just slow down to stop and stare
Open my eyes and man I swear
I saw God today

[Verse 2]
Saw a couple walking by
They were holding hands
And she had that glow
Yeah, I couldn't help
But notice she was starting to show
Stood there for a minute
Taking in the sky
Lost in that sunset
A splash of amber melted into shades of red

[Chorus]
I've been to church
I've read the book
I know He's here
But I don't look
Near as often as I should
Yeah, I know I should
His fingerprints are everywhere
I just slow down to stop and stare
Open my eyes and man I swear
I saw God today

[Verse 3]
Got my face pressed up against the nursery glass
She's sleeping like a rock
My name on her wrist
Wearing tiny pink socks
She's got my nose
She's got her Mama's eyes
My brand new baby girl
She's a miracle
I saw God today"
George Strait,I Just Want to Dance with You,"[Verse 1]
I don't wanna be the kind to hesitate
And be too shy, wait too late
I don't care what they say other lovers do
I just wanna dance with you
I got a feeling that you have a heart like mine
So let it show, let it shine
If we have a chance to make one heart of two
And I just wanna dance with you

[Chorus]
I wanna dance with you
Twirl you all around the floor
That's what they intended dancing for
I just wanna dance with you
I wanna dance with you
Hold you in my arms once more
That's what they invented dancing for
And I just wanna dance with you

[Verse 2]
I caught you looking at me when I looked at you
Yes I did, ain't that true?
You won't get embarrassed by the things I do
I just wanna dance with you
Oh, the boys are playing softly and the girls are too
So am I and so are you
If this was a movie, we'd be right on cue
And I just wanna dance with you

[Chorus]
I wanna dance with you
Twirl you all around the floor
That's what they intended dancing for
And I just wanna dance with you
I wanna dance with you
Hold you in my arms once more
That's what they invented dancing for
And I just wanna dance with you

[Chorus]
I wanna dance with you
Twirl you all around the floor
That's what they intended dancing for
I just wanna dance with you
I wanna dance with you
Hold you in my arms once more
That's what they invented dancing for
And I just wanna dance with you

[Outro]
I just wanna dance with you
I just wanna dance with you
I just wanna dance with you"
George Strait,Write This Down,"[Verse 1]
I never saw the end in sight
Fools are kind of blind
Thought everything was going alright
But I was running out of time

'Cause you had one foot out the door
I swear I didn't see
But if you're really going away
Here's some final words from me

[Chorus]
Baby, write this down, take a little note
To remind you in case you didn't know
Tell yourself I love you and I don't want you to go
Write this down
Take my words and read them every day
Keep them close by, don't you let them fade away
So you'll remember what I forgot to say
Write this down

[Verse 2]
I'll sign it at the bottom of the page
I'll swear under oath
Cause every single word is true
And I think you need to know

So use it as a bookmark
Stick it on your refrigerator door
Hang it in a picture frame up above the mantel
Where you'll see it for sure

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You can find a chisel, I can find a stone
Folks will be reading these words long after we're gone

[Chorus]

Oh, I love you and I don't want you to go
Baby, write this down"
George Strait,Give It Away,"[Verse 1]
She was storming through the house that day
And I could tell she was leaving
And I thought, aw, she'll be back
Till she turned around and pointed at the wall and said

[Verse 2]
That picture from our honeymoon
That night in Frisco Bay
Just give it away
She said, give it away
And that big four-poster king-size bed
Where so much love was made
Just give it away
She said, just give it away

[Chorus]
Just give it away
There ain't nothing in this house worth fighting over
Oh, and we're both tired of fighting anyway
Just give it away

[Bridge]
So I tried to move on
But I found that each woman I held
Just reminded me of that day
Hmm

[Verse 3]
When that front door swung wide open
She flung her diamond ring
Said, give it away
Just give it away
And I said, now, honey, don't you even want
Your half of everything
She said, give it away
Just give it away

[Chorus]
Just give it away
There ain't nothing in this house worth fighting over
Oh, and we're both tired of fighting anyway
Just give it away

[Instrumental interlude]

[Verse 4]
So I'm still right here where she left me
Along with all the other things
She don't care about anymore
Mmm, like that picture from our honeymoon
That night in Frisco Bay
She said, give it away
Well, I can't give it away
And that big four-poster king-size bed
Where all our love was made
She said, give it away
Well, I can't give it away

[Outro]
I've got a furnished house, a diamond ring
And a lonely broken heart
Full of love and I can't even give it away"
George Strait,Carried Away,"[Verse 1]
I don't take my whiskey to extremes
Don't believe in chasing crazy dreams
My feet are planted firmly on the ground
But darling when you come around

[Chorus]
I get carried away by the look by the light in your eyes
Before I even realize the ride I'm on baby I'm long gone
I get carried away nothing matters but being with you
Like a feather flying high up in the sky on a windy day, I get carried away

[Verse 2]
It might seem like an ordinary night
Same ol' stars, the same ol' moon up high
But when I see you standing at your door
Nothing's ordinary anymore

[Chorus]
I get carried away by the look by the light in your eyes
Before I even realize the ride I'm on baby I'm long gone
I get carried away nothing matters but being with you
Like a feather flying high up in the sky on a windy day, I get carried away

[Chorus]
I get carried away by the look by the light in your eyes
Before I even realize the ride I'm on baby I'm long gone
I get carried away nothing matters but being with you
Like a feather flying high up in the sky on a windy day, I get carried away

Carried away"
George Strait,Every Little Honky Tonk Bar,"[Verse 1]
Whiskey is the gasoline that lights the fire that burns the bridge
Ice creates the water that's no longer runnin' under it
Stool holds the fool that pours the whiskey on his broken heart
Cigarettes create the smoke that hides the lonesome in his eyes
The jukebox plays Hank, ""I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry""
Dance floor holds the folks trying to forget who they are
And that's what happens in every little honky tonk bar

[Chorus]
Friday night, it's a given
I'll be L-I-V-N, livin'
We'll dance on the bar 'til we're sleeping it off in the car
Monday morning, it's a given
I'll be D-R-A-G-N, draggin'
And that's what happens in every little honky tonk bar

[Verse 2]
Neon lights flashing bright 'til you're almost hypnotized
Waitress, short skirt, gets hit on by every guy
Comin' and goin', always rollin' with the flow
Bartender, pour our drinks; Código, do a shot
You think you're tall and bulletproof
Until somebody says you're not
You step outside thinkin' you're gonna show 'em you are
And that's what happens in every little honky tonk bar

[Chorus]
Friday night, it's a given
We'll be L-I-V-N, livin'
We'll dance on the bar 'til we're sleeping it off in the car
Monday morning, it's a given
We'll be D-R-A-G-N, draggin'
And that's what happens in every little honky tonk bar
Yeah, that's what happens in every little honky tonk bar

[Outro]
Whiskey is the gasoline that lights the fire that burns the bridge"
George Strait,Baby Blue,"[Verse 1]
She looked so much like a lady
But she was so much like a child
A devil when she held me close
An angel when she smiled
She always held it deep inside
But somehow I always knew
She'd go away when the grass turned green
And the sky turned baby blue

[Chorus]
Baby blue was the color of her eyes
Baby blue like the Colorado skies
Like a breath of spring, she came and left
And I still don't know why
So here's to you and whoever holds my baby blue tonight

[Verse 2]
She brought colors to my life
That my eyes had never touched
And when she taught me how to care
I never cared so much
I try not to think of her
But I fall asleep and do
And drift off where the grass is green
And the sky is baby blue

[Chorus]
Baby blue was the color of her eyes
Baby blue like the Colorado skies
Like a breath of spring, she came and left
And I still don't know why
So here's to you and whoever holds my baby blue tonight

[Chorus]
Baby blue was the color of her eyes
Baby blue like the Colorado skies
Like a breath of spring, she came and left
And I still don't know why
So here's to you and whoever holds my baby blue tonight

[Outro]
Baby blue was the color of her eyes
Baby blue like the Colorado skies
Baby blue was the color of her eyes
Baby blue like the Colorado skies
Baby blue was the color of her eyes
Baby blue like the Colorado skies
Baby blue"
George Strait,The Cowboy Rides Away,"[Verse 1]
I knew the stakes were high right from the start
When she dealt the cards, I bet my heart
Now I just found a game that I can't play
And this is where the cowboy rides away

[Chorus]
And my heart is sinking like the setting sun
Setting on the things I wish I'd done
It's time to say goodbye to yesterday
This is where the cowboy rides away

[Verse 2]
We've been in and out of love and in-between
And now we play the final showdown scene
As the credits roll, a sad song starts to play
And this is where the cowboy rides away

[Chorus]
And my heart is sinking like the setting sun
Setting on the things I wish I'd done
Oh, the last goodbye's the hardest one to say
This is where the cowboy rides away

[Outro]
Oh, the last goodbye's the hardest one to say
This is where the cowboy rides away"
George Strait,I Got a Car,"[Verse 1]
She was leaning on a rail in a cotton dress
Summer tanned pretty, little perfect mess
With a story that could only be anybody's guess
And I was thinking that I probably didn't stand a chance
But I rolled up my sleeves, walked up, and I said
""Hey, I know I don't know you but I'd kind of like a shot""
She said, ""I saw you coming over, I already thought it over and okay, so now what?""

[Chorus]
And I said, ""Well, I got a car,"" she said, ""There's something
At least it's a start,"" I said, ""It's better than nothing
I ain't in no hurry but I'm ready when you are""
And she said, ""Where do you think all this is going?""
I said, ""There ain't no way of knowing
I guess I hadn't thought it through that far
But I got a car""

[Verse 2]
So we let the wheels turn and the windows down
We let ourselves go all the way through town
She never said stop and I never asked her why
We drove into the night, when out of nowhere
She said, ""I'd give anything to never go back there
And I kind of wish this day would never end""
She said, ""I could use a change but I don't even know where to begin""

[Chorus]
And I said, ""Well, I got a car,"" she said, ""There's something
At least it's a start,"" I said, ""It's better than nothing
I ain't in no hurry but I'm ready when you are""
And she said, ""Where do you think all this is going?""
I said, ""There ain't no way of knowing
I really hadn't thought it through that far
I can't promise you the moon and the stars
But I got a car""

[Verse 3]
We got lost in the miles, lost track of the days
'Til we finally found a stopping place
When the doctor said, ""You know what's on the way?""
And we found ourselves in a little white house
One Sunday morning, rain pouring down
She said, ""I think it's time, but all the lines are out""

[Verse 4]
And her eyes teared up and she said, ""What are we gonna do now?""
And I said, ""Well, I got a car, she said, there's something
You think it'll start?"" I said, ""It's already running
Got your things in the back and I'm ready when you are""
She said, ""Are you sure it'll get us where we're going?""
I said, ""If there's one thing I know, girl, it's gotten us this far
And I don't mean to hurry, but I'm ready when you are"""
George Strait,Jingle Bell Rock,"[Intro]
Jingle Bell, Jingle Bell, Jingle Bell Rock
Jingle bell swing and jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun
Jingle Bell, Jingle Bell, Jingle Bell Rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air

[Verse]
What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh

[Refrain]
Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling feet
That's the jingle bell rock

[Verse]
What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh

[Refrain]
Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling feet
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell

George Strait,Fool Hearted Memory,"[Verse 1]
Nickels and dimes, memories and wine
She's on his mind once again
The same old stool, the same old fool
Played by the rules but didn't win

[Pre-Chorus 1]
There's an old love in his heart that he can't lose
He tried forgetting, but he knows that it's no use

[Chorus]
He's got a fool hearted memory
It won't let him see that she walked out the door
He's got a fool hearted memory
And he sits patiently here every night so it can fool him more

[Verse 2]
She was his girl, his only world
That string of pearls that slipped away
A thousand dimes a thousand times
He doesn't mind what they say

[Pre-Chorus 2]
He fills the jukebox, then plays the same old song
He fills his glass and then he turns her memory on

[Chorus]
But it's a fool hearted memory
It won't let him see that she walked out the door
He's got a fool hearted memory
And he sits patiently here every night so it can fool him more

[Chorus]
He's got a fool hearted memory
It won't let him see that she walked out the door
He's got a fool hearted memory
And he sits patiently here every night so it can fool him more"
George Strait,Deep in the Heart of Texas,"The stars at night - are big and bright
Deep in the heart of Texas
The prairie sky - is wide and high
Deep in the heart of Texas
The Sage in bloom - is like perfume
Deep in the heart of Texas
Reminds me of - the one I love
Deep in the heart of Texas
The cowboys cry - ki-yip-pie-yi
Deep in the heart of Texas
The rabbits rush - around the brush
Deep in the heart of Texas
The coyotes wail - along the trail
Deep in the heart of Texas
The doggies bawl - and bawl and bawl
Deep in the heart of Texas"
George Strait,The Fireman,"[Chorus]
Well, they call me the fireman - that's my name
Making my rounds all over town putting out old flames
Hell, everybody'd like to have a what I got
I can cool 'em down when they're smoldering hot
I'm the fireman - that's my name

[Verse 1]
Last night they had a bad one a mile or two down the road
My buddy walked out and left his woman burning out of control
Well, I was down there in about an hour or so
With a little mouth to mouth, she was ready to go
I'm the fireman - that's my name

[Chorus]
Well, they call me the fireman - that's my name
Making my rounds all over town putting out old flames
Hell, everybody'd like to have a what I got
I can cool 'em down when they're smoldering hot
I'm the fireman - that's my name

[Verse 2]
Got a fire engine red T-bird automobile
In a minute or less I can be dressed fit to kill
I work twenty-four on, twenty-four off
When they get too hot, they just give me a call
I'm the fireman - that's my name

[Chorus]
Well, they call me the fireman - that's my name
Making my rounds all over town putting out old flames
Hell, everybody'd like to have a what I got
I can cool 'em down when they're smoldering hot
I'm the fireman - that's my name"
Merle Haggard,Okie from Muskogee,"[Verse 1]
We don't smoke marijuana in Muskogee
We don't take our trips on LSD
We don't burn our draft cards down on Main Street
'Cause we like living right, and being free

[Verse 2]
We don't make a party out of loving
But we like holding hands and pitching woo
We don't let our hair go long and shaggy
Like the hippies out in San Francisco do

[Chorus]
And I'm proud to be an Okie from Muskogee
A place where even squares can have a ball
We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse
And white lightning's still the biggest thrill of all

[Verse 3]
Leather boots are still in style for manly footwear
Beads and Roman sandals won't be seen
And football's still the roughest thing on campus
And the kids here still respect the college dean

[Chorus]
And I'm proud to be an Okie from Muskogee
A place where even squares can have a ball
We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse
And white lightning's still the biggest thrill of all
And white lightning's still the biggest thrill of all
(In Muskogee Oklahoma USA)"
Merle Haggard,Mama Tried,"[Verse 1]
The first thing I remember knowin'
Was a lonesome whistle blowin'
And a young'n's dream of growing up to ride
On a freight train leaving town
Not knowing where I'm bound
And no one could change my mind, but mama tried

[Verse 2]
A one and only rebel child
From a family meek and mild
My mama seemed to know what lay in store
Despite all my Sunday learnin'
Towards the bad I kept on turnin'
'Til mama couldn't hold me anymore

[Chorus]
And I turned twenty-one in prison, doing life without parole
No one could steer me right, but mama tried, mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading I denied
That leaves only me to blame, 'cause mama tried

[Verse 3]
Dear old daddy, rest his soul
Left my mom a heavy load
She tried so very hard to fill his shoes
Working hours without rest
Wanted me to have the best
She tried to raise me right, but I refused

[Chorus]
And I turned twenty-one in prison, doing life without parole
No one could steer me right, but mama tried, mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading I denied
That leaves only me to blame, 'cause mama tried"
Merle Haggard,One Day At a Time,"[Verse 1]
I'm only human, I'm just a man
Help me to believe in what I can be and all that I am
Show me the stairway that I have to climb
Lord, for my sake, teach me to take one day at a time

[Chorus]
One day at a time, sweet Jesus, that's all I'm asking of you
Give me the strength to do every day what I have to do
Yesterday's gone, sweet Jesus, and tomorrow may never be mine
So for my sake, teach me to take one day at a time

[Verse 2]
Do you remember when you walked among men?
Well Jesus you know, if you're looking below, it's worse now than then
Pushing and shoving, crowding my mind
So for my sake, teach me to take one day at a time

[Chorus]
One day at a time, sweet Jesus, that's all I'm asking of you
Give me the strength to do every day what I have to do
Yesterday's gone, sweet Jesus, and tomorrow may never be mine
So for my sake, teach me to take one day at a time

[Outro]
Yes, just for my sake, teach me to take one day at a time"
Merle Haggard,I’m a White Boy,"Some folks call me a ramblin’ man
I do a lotta thumbin’ and a kickin’ cans
And it wouldn’t do an ounce of good to call my name
Cause daddy’s name wadn’t Willy Woodrow
And I wadn’t born and raised in no ghetto
Just a white boy lookin’ for a place to do my thing

Well I’m out to find me a wealthy woman
And a line of work that don’t take no diploma
I ain’t got much to lose but a lot to gain
Well some might call me a goodtime fella
I ain’t black and I ain’t yella
Just a white boy lookin’ for a place to do my thing

Yeah I don’t want no handout livin’
Don’t want any part of anything they’re givin’
I’m proud and white and I’ve got a song to sing
Well I’ve said a few things and I’ll admit it
If you wanna get ahead you gotta hump and get it
I’m a white boy lookin’ for a place to do my thing

Hump and git it now
Yeah I’m a small town boy been around a little
I like guitars and I like a fiddle
And that’s the kinda soul it takes to fan my flame
Well I’m a blue eyed Billy kinda frail and ruddy
So I’ll have to work to be somebody
I’m a white boy lookin’ for a place to do my thing

I don’t want no handout livin’
And don’t want any part of anything they’re givin’
I’m proud and white and I’ve got a song to sing
Well I’ve said a few things and I’ll admit it
If you wanna get ahead you gotta hump and get it

I’m a white boy lookin’ for a place to do my thing"
Merle Haggard,Sing Me Back Home,"[Verse 1]
The warden led a prisoner down the hallway to his doom
And I stood up to say goodbye like all the rest
And I heard him tell the warden just before he reached my cell
""Let my guitar-playing friend do my request.""

[Chorus]
Let him sing me back home with a song I used to hear
Make my old memories come alive
Take me away and turn back the years
Sing me back home before I die

[Verse 2]
I recall last Sunday morning a choir from off the street
Came in to sing a few old gospel songs
And I heard him tell the singers, ""There's a song my mama sang
Could I hear it once before you move along?""

[Chorus]
Won't you sing me back home with a song I used to hear?
Make my old memories come alive
Take me away and turn back the years
Sing me back home before I die
Sing me back home before I die"
Merle Haggard,That’s the Way Love Goes,"[Verse]
I've been throwing horseshoes over my left shoulder
I've spent most all my life searching for that four-leaf clover
Yet you ran with me, chasing my rainbows
Honey, I love you too and that's the way love goes

[Chorus]
That's the way love goes, babe
That's the music God made
For all the world to sing
It's never old, it grows
Losing makes me sorry
You say ""Honey, now don't worry""
Don't you know I love you too?
And that's the way love goes

[Chorus]
That's the way love goes, babe
That's the music God made
For all the world to sing
It's never old, it grows
Losing makes me sorry
You say ""Honey, don't worry""
Don't you know I love you too?
And that's the way love goes"
Merle Haggard,If We Make It Through December,"[Chorus]
If we make it through December
Everything's gonna be all right, I know
It's the coldest time of winter
And I shiver when I see the falling snow
If we make it through December
Got plans to be in a warmer town come summertime
Maybe even California
If we make it through December, we'll be fine

[Verse]
Got laid off down at the factory
And their timing is not the greatest in the world
Heaven knows I've been working hard
I wanted Christmas to be right for Daddy's girl
I don't mean to hate December
It's meant to be the happy time of year
But my little girl don't understand
Why Daddy can't afford no Christmas gear

[Chorus]
If we make it through December
Everything's gonna be all right, I know
It's the coldest time of winter
And I shiver when I see the falling snow
If we make it through December
Got plans to be in a warmer town come summertime
Maybe even California
If we make it through December, we'll be fine"
Merle Haggard,He Walks With Me (In The Garden),"[Verse 1]
I come to the garden alone
While the dew is still on the roses
And the voice I hear falling on my ear
The son of God discloses

[Chorus]
And he walks with me and he talks with me
And he tells me I am his own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known

[Verse 2]
He speaks and the sound of his voice is so sweet
The birds hush their singing
And the melody that he gave to me
Within my heart is ringing

[Chorus]
And he walks with me and he talks with me
And he tells me I am his own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known"
Merle Haggard,Ramblin’ Fever,"[Verse 1]
My hat don't hang on the same nail too long
My ears can't stand to hear the same old song
And I don't leave the highway long enough
To bog down in the mud
'Cause I've got ramblin' fever in my blood

[Verse 2]
I caught this ramblin' fever long ago
When I first heard a lonesome whistle blow
If someone said I ever gave a damn
They damn sure told you wrong
I've had ramblin' fever all along

[Chorus]
Ramblin' fever
The kind that can't be measured by degrees
Ramblin' fever
There ain't no kind of cure for my disease

[Verse 3]
There's times I'd like to bed down on a sofa
And let some pretty lady rub my back
And spend the early morning drinking coffee
And talkin' about when I'll be coming back

[Verse 4]
'Cause I don't let no woman tie me down
And I'll never get too old to get around
I want to die along the highway and rot away
Like some old highline pole
And rest this ramblin' fever in my soul

[Chorus]
Ramblin' fever
The kind that can't be measured by degrees
Ramblin' fever
There ain't no kind of cure for my disease
Ooh, yeah"
Merle Haggard,Rainbow Stew,"[Verse 1]
There's a big brown cloud in the city
And the countryside's a sin
And the price of life is too high to give up
Got to come down again
When the world wide war is over and done
And the dream of peace comes true
We'll all be drinking that free bubble up
And eating that rainbow stew
When they find out how to burn water
And the gasoline car is gone
When an airplane flies without any fuel
And sunlight heats our home
One of these days when the air clears up
And the sun come shining through

[Pre-Chorus]
We'll all be drinking that free bubble up
And eating that rainbow stew

[Chorus]
Eating rainbow stew with a silver spoon
Underneath that sky of blue
We'll all be drinking that free bubble up
And eating that rainbow stew

[Verse 2]
You don't have to get high to be happy
Just think about what's in store
When people start doing what they oughta to be doing
They won't be booing no more
When a president goes through the white house doors
And does what he says he'll do

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus 2x]"
Merle Haggard,The Fightin’ Side of Me,"[Verse 1]
I hear people talking bad
About the way they have to live here in this country
Harping on the wars we fight
And griping 'bout the way things ought to be
And I don't mind them switching sides
And standing up for things they believe in
But when they're running down our country, man
They're walking on the fighting side of me

[Chorus]
They're walking on the fighting side of me
Running down a way of life
Our fighting men have fought and died to keep
If you don't love it, leave it
Let this song that I'm singing be a warning
When you're running down our country, hoss
You're walking on the fighting side of me

[Verse 2]
I read about some squirrely guy
Who claims that he just don't believe in fighting
And I wonder just how long
The rest of us can count on being free
They love our milk and honey
But they preach about some other way of living
And when they're running down our country, man
They're walking on the fighting side of me

[Chorus]
They're walking on the fighting side of me
Running down a way of life
Our fighting men have fought and died to keep
If you don't love it, leave it
Let this song that I'm singing be a warning
When you're running down our country, man
You're walking on the fighting side of me

[Outro]
You're walking on the fighting side of me
Running down a way of life
Our fighting men have fought and died to keep
If you don't love it, leave it
Let this song that I'm singing be a warning
When you're running down our country, hoss
You're walking on the fighting side of me"
Merle Haggard,Big City,"[Verse 1]
I'm tired of this dirty old city
Entirely too much work and never enough play
And I'm tired of these dirty old sidewalks
Think I'll walk off my steady job today

[Chorus]
Turn me loose, set me free
Somewhere in the middle of Montana
And give me all I've got coming to me
And keep your retirement
And your so-called social security
Big City, turn me loose and set me free
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Been working every day since I was twenty
Haven't got a thing to show for anything I've done
There's folks who never work and they've got plenty
Think it's time some guys like me had some fun
So

[Chorus]
Turn me loose, set me free
Somewhere in the middle of Montana
And give me all I've got coming to me
And keep your retirement
And your so-called social security
Big City, turn me loose and set me free

[Outro]
Hey, Big City, turn me loose and set me free"
Merle Haggard,Silver Wings,"[Chorus]
Silver wings shining in the sunlight
Roaring engines headed somewhere in flight
They're taking you away, leaving me lonely
Silver wings slowly fading out of sight

[Verse]
""Don't leave me,"" I cry
Don't take that airplane ride
But you locked me out of your mind
Left me standing here behind

[Chorus]
Silver wings shining in the sunlight
Roaring engines headed somewhere in flight
They're taking you away, leaving me lonely
Silver wings slowly fading out of sight

[Chorus]
Silver wings shining in the sunlight
Roaring engines headed somewhere in flight
They're taking you away, leaving me lonely
Silver wings slowly fading out of sight"
Merle Haggard,I Think I’ll Just Stay Here and Drink,"[Verse 1]
I could be holding you tonight
I could quit doing wrong, start doing right
You don't care about what I think

[Refrain]
Think I'll just stay here and drink

[Verse 2]
Hey, putting you down won't square the deal
At least you'll know the way I feel
Hey, take all the money in the bank

Think I'll just stay here and drink

[Verse 3]
Hey, listen close and you can hear
That loud jukebox playing in my ear
Ain't no woman gonna change the way I think

[Bridge]
Yessir
Here comes that piano
Yessir

[Verse 4]
Hey, hurtin' me now don't mean a thing
Since love ain't here it don't feel the pain
My mind ain't nothing but a total blank

[Refrain]
I think I'll just stay here and drink
Yeah

[Outro]
We're gone"
Merle Haggard,America First,"[Verse]
Why don't we liberate these United States
We're the ones need it the worst
Let the rest of the world help us for a change
And let's rebuild America first

Our highways and bridges are falling apart
Who's blessed and who has been cursed?
There's things to be done all over the world
But let's rebuild America first

Who's on the Hill and who's watching the valley?
And who's in charge of it all?
God bless the Army and God bless our liberty
And dadgum the rest of it all

Yeah, men in position are backing away
Freedom is stuck in reverse
Let's get out of Iraq and get back on the track
And let's rebuild America first

Why don't we liberate these United States?
We're the ones who need it the most
You think I'm blowing smoke? Boys, it ain't no joke
I make twenty trips a year from coast to coast"
Merle Haggard,I’m a Lonesome Fugitive,"[Verse 1]
Down every road, there's always one more city
I'm on the run, the highway is my home
I raised a lot of Cain back in my younger days
While Mama used to pray my crops would fail
Now I'm a hunted fugitive with just two ways
Outrun the law or spend my life in jail

[Chorus]
I'd like to settle down, but they won't let me
A fugitive must be a rolling stone
Down every road, there's always one more city
I'm on the run, the highway is my home

[Verse 2]
I'm lonely, but I can't afford the luxury
Of having one I love to come along
She'd only slow me down and they'd catch up with me
For he who travels fastest goes alone

[Chorus]
I'd like to settle down, but they won't let me
A fugitive must be a rolling stone
Down every road there's always one more city
I'm on the run, the highway is my home
I'm on the run, the highway is my home"
Merle Haggard,Are the Good Times Really Over (I Wish a Buck Was Still Silver),"[Verse 1]
I wish a buck was still silver
It was back when the country was strong
Back before Elvis
And before the Vietnam War came along
Before The Beatles and ""Yesterday""
When a man could still work, and still would

[Refrain]
Is the best of the free life behind us now?
And are the good times really over for good?

And are we rolling downhill
Like a snowball headed for hell?
With no kind of chance for
The flag or the Liberty Bell
I wish a Ford and a Chevy
Would still last ten years, like they should

[Refrain]
Is the best of the free life behind us now?
And are the good times really over for good?

I wish coke was still cola
And a joint was a bad place to be
And it was back before Nixon
Lied to us all on TV
Before microwave ovens
When a girl could still cook, and still would

[Refrain]
Is the best of the free life behind us now?
And are the good times really over for good?

Are we rolling downhill
Like a snowball headed for hell?

Would still last ten years, like they should

Is the best of the free life behind us now?
And are the good times really over for good?

Stop rolling downhill
Like a snowball headed for hell
Stand up for the flag
And let's all ring the Liberty Bell
Let's make a Ford and a Chevy
That'll still last ten years, like they should

[Outro]
'Cause the best of the free life is still yet to come
And the good times ain't over for good"
Merle Haggard,The Way I Am,"[Verse 1]
Wish I were down on some blue bayou
With a bamboo cane stuck in the sand
But the road I'm on don't seem to go there
So I just dream, keep on being the way I am

[Verse 2]
Wish I enjoyed what makes my living
Did what I do with a willing hand
Some would run, but that ain't like me
So I just dream and keep on being the way I am

[Chorus]
The way I am don't fit my shackles
The way I am, reality
I can almost see that bobber dancing
But I just dream, keep on being the way I am

[Chorus]
The way I am don't fit my shackles
The way I am, reality
I can almost see that bobber dancing
But I just dream, keep on being the way I am

I just dream, keep on being the way I am"
Merle Haggard,Workin’ Man Blues,"[Verse 1]
It's a big job just getting by with nine kids and a wife
But I've been a working man dang near all my life
And I'll keep on working
As long as my two hands are fit to use

[Refrain]
I'll drink my beer in a tavern
Sing a little bit of these working man blues

[Verse 2]

Come Monday morning I'm right back with the crew

I'll drink a little beer that evening
Sing a little bit of these working man blues

I want to throw my bills out the window, catch a train to another town
But I'll go back working
I gotta buy my kids a brand new pair of shoes

I'll drink a little beer in a tavern
Cry a little bit of these working man blues

Merle Haggard,Nobody’s Darling But Mine,"[Verse]
Come lay by my side, little darling
Come lay your cool hand on my brow
And promise me that you will always
Be nobody's darling but mine

You're as sweet as the flowers in springtime
You're as pure as the dew from a rose
And I'd rather be somebody's darling
Than a poor boy that nobody knows

Be nobody's darling but mine, love
Be honest, be faithful, be kind
And promise me that you will always
Be nobody's darling but mine

Goodbye, little darling, I'm leaving
I'm leaving this cold world behind
So promise me that you will never
Be nobody's darling but mine"

I almost felt you touchin' me just now
I wish I knew which way to turn and go
I feel so good and then I feel so bad
And I wonder what I ought to do

[Chorus]
If I could only fly, if I could only fly
I'd bid this place goodbye to come and be with you
But I can hardly stand and I got nowhere to run
Another sinking sun and one more lonely night

[Verse]
The wind keeps blowin' somewhere every day
Tell me things get better somewhere up the way
Just dismal thinking on a dismal day
The sad songs for us to bear

[Chorus]
If I could only fly, if I could only fly
I'd bid this place goodbye to come and be with you
But I can hardly stand and I got nowhere to run
Another sinking sun and one more lonely night

[Verse]
You know sometimes I write happy songs
Then some little thing goes wrong
And I wish they all could make you smile
Coming home soon and I want to stay
Maybe we can somehow get away
And I wish you could come with me when I go again

[Outro]
If I could only fly
If we could only fly
If you could only fly
There'd be no more lonely nights"
Merle Haggard,Running Kind,"[Chorus]
I was born the running kind
With leaving always on my mind
Home was never home to me at any time
Every front door found me hoping
I would find the back door open
There just had to be an exit for the running kind

[Verse]
Within me, there's a prison surrounding me alone
As real as any dungeon with its walls of stone
I know running's not the answer
But running's been my nature
And a part of me that keeps me moving on

[Chorus]
I was born the running kind
With leaving always on my mind
Home was never home to me at any time
Every front door found me hoping
I would find the back door open
There just had to be an exit for the running kind

[Chorus]
I was born the running kind
With leaving always on my mind
Home was never home to me at any time
Every front door found me hoping
I would find the back door open
There just had to be an exit for the running kind"
Merle Haggard,The Bottle Let Me Down,"[Verse 1]
Each night I leave the bar room when it's over
Not feeling any pain at closing time
But tonight your memory found me much too sober
I couldn't drink enough to keep you off my mind

[Chorus]
Tonight the bottle let me down
And let your memory come around
The one true friend I thought I'd found
Tonight the bottle let me down

[Verse 2]
I've always had a bottle I could turn to
And lately I've been turning every day
But the wine don't take effect the way it used to
And I'm hurting in an old familiar way

[Chorus]
Tonight the bottle let me down
And let your memory come around
The one true friend I thought I'd found
Tonight the bottle let me down
Tonight the bottle let me down"
Merle Haggard,He Walks With Me,"I come to the garden alone
While the dew is still on roses
And the voice I hear falling
On my ear the son of God discloses

And He walks with me and He talks with me
And He tells me I am His own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known

He speaks and the sound of His voice
Is so sweet the birds hush their singing
And the melody that He gave to me
Within my heart is ringing

And He walks with me and He talks with me
And He tells me I am His own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known"
Merle Haggard,The Fugitive,"Down every road there's always one more city
I'm on the run the highway is my home
I raised a lot a cane back in my younger days
While mama used to pray my crops would fail
Now I'm a hunted fugitive with just two ways
Outrun the law or spend my life in jail
I'd like to settle down but they won't let me
A fugitive must be a rolling stone
Down every road there's always one more city
I'm on the run the highway is my home
(Guitar Music)
I'm lonely but I can't afford the luxury
Of having one I love to come along
She'd only slow me down and they'd catch up with me
For he who travel fastest goes alone
I'd like to settle down but they won't let me
A fugitive must be a rolling stone
Down every road there's always one more city
I'm on the run the highway is my home
I'm on the run the highway is my home"
Reba McEntire,The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia,"[Verse 1]
He was on his way home from Candletop
Been two weeks gone and he thought he'd stop
At Web's and have him a drink 'fore he went home to her
Andy Wo-Lo said hello, he said, ""Hi, what's new?"" and Wo said
""Sit down, I got some bad news that's gonna hurt""

[Verse 2]
Said, ""I'm your best friend and you know that's right
But your young bride ain't home tonight
Since you've been gone, she's been seein' that Amos boy, Seth""
Now he got mad and he saw red
Andy said, ""Boy, don't you lose your head
'Cause to tell you the truth, I've been with her myself""

[Chorus]
That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
'Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands

[Verse 3]
Well, Andy got scared and left the bar
Walking on home 'cause he didn't live far
You see, Andy didn't have many friends and he just lost him one
Brother thought his wife must have left town
So he went home and finally found
The only thing Daddy had left him, and that was a gun

[Verse 4]
He went off to Andy's house
Slipping through the backwoods quiet as a mouse
Came upon some tracks too small for Andy to make
He looked through the screen at the back porch door
And he saw Andy lying on the floor
In a puddle of blood, and he started to shake

[Bridge]
The Georgia patrol was making their rounds
So he fired a shot just to flag 'em down
A big-bellied sheriff grabbed his gun and said
""Why'd you do it?""

[Verse 5]
The judge said guilty on a make-believe trial
Slapped the sheriff on the back with a smile
He said, ""Supper's waiting at home and I gotta get to it""

[Chorus]
That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
'Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands

[Verse 6]
Well, they hung my brother before I could say
The tracks he saw while on his way
To Andy's house and back that night were mine
And his cheating wife had never left town
That's one body that'll never be found
You see, little sister don't miss when she aims her gun

[Chorus]
That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
'Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands
That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
'Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands"
Reba McEntire,Fancy,"[Verse 1]
I remember it all very well looking back
It was the summer I turned eighteen
We lived in a one-room, rundown shack
On the outskirts of New Orleans
We didn't have money for food or rent
To say the least, we were hard pressed
Then mama spent every last penny we had
To buy me a dancing dress
Well, Mama washed and combed and curled my hair
Then she painted my eyes and lips (Lips)
Then I stepped into a satin dancing dress
That had a split on the side clean up to my hip
It was red velvet trim and it had fit me good
Well, standing back from the looking glass
There stood a woman where a half-grown kid had stood

[Chorus]
She said, ""Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down""
She said, ""Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down""

[Verse 2]
Mama dabbed a little bit of perfume on my neck
Then she kissed my cheek
And then I saw the tears welling up in her troubled eyes
As she started to speak
She looked at our pitiful shack
And then she looked at me and took a ragged breath
She said, ""Your Pa's runned off and I'm real sick
And the baby's gonna starve to death""
She handed me a heart-shaped locket that said
""To thine own self be true""
And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across
The toe of my high-heeled shoe
It sounded like somebody else that was talking
Asking Mama, ""What do I do?""
She said, ""Just be nice to the gentlemen, Fancy
They'll be nice to you""

[Chorus]
She said, ""Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Lord, forgive me for what I do
But if you want out, well, it's up to you
Now don't let me down now
Your Mama's gonna move you uptown""

[Verse 3]
Well, that was the last time I saw my Ma
The night I left that rickety shack
The welfare people came and took the baby
Mama died and I ain't been back
But the wheels of fate had started to turn
And for me there was no way out
It wasn't very long until I knew exactly
What my Mama'd been talking about
I knew what I had to do and I made myself this solemn vow
That I was gonna be a lady someday
Though I didn't know when or how
But I couldn't see spending the rest of my life
With my head hung down in shame
You know I might've been born just plain white trash
But Fancy was my name

[Chorus]
She said, ""Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down""
She said, ""Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down""

[Verse 4]
It wasn't long after a benevolent man
Took me in off the streets
And one week later I was pouring his tea
In a five-room hotel suite (Yes, she was)
I charmed a king, congressman
And an occasional aristocrat
Then I got me a Georgia mansion
And an elegant New York townhouse flat
And I ain't done bad (She ain't done bad)

[Verse 5]
Now in this world
There's a lot of self-righteous hypocrites that call me bad
They criticize Mama for turning me out
No matter how little we had
But though I ain't had to worry about nothing
For nigh on fifteen years
Well, I can still hear the desperation
In my poor Mama's voice ringing in my ears

[Chorus]
""Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Oh, here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Lord, forgive me for what I do
But if you want out, well, it's up to you
Now don't let me down, hon'
Your Mama's gonna move you uptown""
Oh, and I guess she did"
Reba McEntire,I’m a Survivor,"[Verse 1]
I was born three months too early
The doctor gave me thirty days
But I must've had my momma's will
And God's amazing grace
I guess I'll keep on livin'
Even if this love's to die for
'Cause your bags are packed and I ain't cryin'
You're walkin' out and I'm not tryin' to change your mind
'Cause I was born to be

[Chorus]
The baby girl without a chance
A victim of the circumstance
The one who ought to give up
But she's just too hard headed
A single mom who works two jobs
Who loves her kids and never stops
With gentle hands and a heart of a fighter
I'm a survivor

[Verse 2]
I don't believe in self-pity
It only brings you down
May be the queen of broken hearts
But I don't hide behind the crown
When the deck is stacked against me
I just play a different game
My roots are planted in the past
And though my life is changing fast
And who I am is who I wanna be

[Chorus]
The baby girl without a chance
A victim of the circumstance
The one who ought to give up
But she's just too hard headed
A single mom who works two jobs
Who loves her kids and never stops
With gentle hands and a heart of a fighter
I'm a survivor

[Chorus]
Oh, a single mom who works two jobs
Who loves her kids and never stops
With gentle hands and a heart of a fighter
I'm a survivor
But I must've had my mamma's will and God's
Amazing grace

[Outro]
I'm a survivor
I'm a survivor"
Reba McEntire,Does He Love You,"[Verse]
I've known about you for a while now
When he leaves me he wears a smile now
As soon as he's away from me
In your arms is where he wants to be
But you're the one he rushes home to
You're the one he gave his name to
I never see his face in the early morning light
You have his mornings, his daytimes
And sometimes I have his nights

[Pre-Chorus]
But does he love you? (does he love you?)
Like he loves me (like he loves me)
Does he think of you? (does he think of you?)
When he's holding me
And does he whisper (does he whisper) all of his fantasies?
Does he love you (does he love you) like he's been loving me?

[Chorus 1]
But when he's with me, he says he needs me
And that he wants me, that he believes in me

[Chorus 2]
And when I'm in his arms, oh he swears there's no one else
Is he deceiving me, or am I deceiving myself?

[Bridge]
Oh, shouldn’t I lose my temper?
Oh, and shouldn’t I be ashamed?
Cause I have everything to lose
And I, I have nothing to gain

[Pre-Chorus]
But does he love you? (does he love you?)
Like he loves me (like he loves me)
Does he think of you? (does he think of you?)
When he's holding me
And does he whisper (does he whisper) all of his fantasies?
Does he love you (does he love you) like he's been loving me?

[Chorus 1]
But when he's with me, he says he needs me
And that he wants me, that he believes in me

[Chorus 2]
And when I'm in his arms, oh he swears there's no one else
Is he deceiving me, or am I deceiving myself?"
Reba McEntire,Angel’s Lullaby,"Midnight moonlight shining through the curtain lace
Paints a perfect picture on your perfect face
One sweet angel sleeping in my arms
You are the promise I knew God would keep
You are the gift that makes my world complete

And you'll never know how much I love you
But I'll keep on telling you my whole life through
Now I believe in miracles, and you're the reason why
So dream on while I sing you my angel's lullaby"
Reba McEntire,I Need To Talk To You,"The whole town would be talking
If someone saw you in here with me
I'm telling you I'd understand
If you feel you need to leave
This room rents by the hour
Oh but I've got it all night long
This is the first time that I've asked you here
It ain't the first time that I've done wrong

I need to talk to you
I need to know your words are true
Don't just tell me, show me, give me, all that I need
I need to talk to you

Those pills there on the nightstand
They help make me believe
That the man I'm laying down with
Really cares for me
This book you see me holding
I usually hide in the drawer
I've done my best to put you away
I can't hide from you anymore

I need to talk to you
I need to know your words are true
Don't just tell me, show me, give me, all that I need
I need to talk to you

Oh, I've spent my whole life regretting
Each day that I've spent before
It's time that I face the things that I've done
Oh and that's what I came here for

Cause I need to talk to you
I need to know your words are true
Don't just tell me, show me, give me, all that I need
I need to talk to you
I need to talk to you"
Reba McEntire,Seven Minutes in Heaven,"[Verse 1]
I wouldn't ask Cash why he wore all-black
Or have Elvis sing me a song
I wouldn't ask why Kennedy died
'Cause I know that I wouldn't have long
I wouldn't small talk with Peter about those pearly gates
I'd ask him to let me on in
And I'd say somebody's waitin' on the other side
That I'd really like to catch up with

[Chorus]
If I had seven minutes in Heaven
I know just what I'd do
Take a walk down those golden streets
And find a quiet corner booth
I wouldn't spend all my seconds askin' God questions
'Cause He knows I'd be back soon
If I had seven minutes in Heavеn
I'd spend them all with you

[Verse 2]
How's the fishin' up thеre
Have you been gettin' our prayers
We've been sendin' them every night
The only issue here is oh Lord we miss you
But I swear we're doin' alright
Does the weather get colder?
Do you ever grow older?
Does it feel like the blink of an eye?
I'm so glad to be here
And I sure hope they serve beer
'Cause, for me, it's been a long time

[Chorus]
If I had seven minutes in Heaven
I know just what I'd do
Take a walk down those golden streets
And find a quiet corner booth
I wouldn't spend all my seconds askin' God questions
'Cause He knows I'll be back soon
If I had seven minutes in Heaven
I'd spend them all with you

[Bridge]
When it's last call, I'll hug you
And I'll tell you, ""I love you""
But I won't say goodbye
Right now, I got to leave
But the next round's on me
And I know it won't be the last time

[Chorus]
If I had seven minutes in Heaven
Then I know just what we'll do
Oh we'll take a walk down those golden streets
And find that same old corner booth
But I might take a few seconds to ask God some questions
I didn't last time I was through
If I had seven minutes in Heaven
I'd spend them all with you

[Outro]
If I had seven minutes in Heaven
I'd spend them all with you"
Reba McEntire,The Greatest Man I Never Knew,"[Verse 1]
The greatest man I never knew
Lived just down the hall
And everyday we said hello
But never touched at all
He was in his paper
I was in my room
How was I to know he thought I hung the moon?

[Verse 2]
The greatest man I never knew
Came home late every night
He never had too much to say
Too much was on his mind
I never really knew him
Well, now it seems so sad
Everything he gave to us took all he had

[Bridge]
Then the days turned into years
And the memories to black and white
He grew cold like an old winter wind
Blowing across my life

[Verse 3]
The greatest words I never heard
I guess I'll never hear
The man I thought could never die
He's been dead almost a year
Oh, he was good at business
But there was business left to do
He never said he loved me
Guess he thought I knew"
Reba McEntire,"If You See Him, If You See Her","[Verse 1: Reba McEntire]
If you see him
Tell him I wish him well
How am I doin'?
Well, sometimes it's hard to tell

[Pre-Chorus: Reba McEntire]
I still miss him more than ever
But please don't say a word

[Chorus: Reba McEntire]
If you see him
Oh, if you see him

[Verse 2: Ronnie Dunn]
If you see her
Tell her I'm doin' fine
And if you want to
Say that I think of her from time to time

[Pre-Chorus: Ronnie Dunn & Kix Brooks]
Ask her if she ever wonders
Where we both went wrong

[Chorus: Ronnie Dunn & Kix Brooks]
If you see her
If you see her

[Bridge: Ronnie Dunn, Reba McEntire, Ronnie Dunn & Reba McEntire]
Oh, I... I still want her
And I still need him so
Oh, I don't know why we let each other go

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3: Ronnie Dunn, Reba McEntire]
If you see her
Tell her the light's still on for her
Nothing's changed
Deep down the fire still burns for him

[Pre-Chorus: Ronnie Dunn, Kix Brooks & Reba McEntire]
And even if it takes forever
Say I'll still be here

[Chorus: Reba McEntire, Ronnie Dunn]
If you see him
If you see her
If you see him
If you see her"
Reba McEntire,She Thinks His Name Was John,"[Verse 1]
She can account for all of the men in her past
Where they are now, who they married, how many kids they have
She knew their backgrounds, family and friends
A few she even talks to now and then
But there is one she can't put her finger on
There is one who never leaves her thoughts
And she thinks his name was John

[Verse 2]
A chance meeting, a party a few years back
Broad shoulders and blue eyes, his hair was so black
He was a friend of friend you could say
She let his smile just sweep her away
And in her heart, though she knew that it was wrong
But too much wine and she left his bed at dawn
And she thinks his name was John

[Verse 3]
Now each day is one day that's left in her life
She won't know love, have a marriage, or sing lullabies
She lays all alone and cries herself to sleep
'Cause she let a stranger kill her hopes and her dreams
And all her friends say what a pity, what a loss
And in the end, when she was barely hangin' on
All she could say is she thinks his name was John
She thinks his name was John"
Reba McEntire,The Christmas Guest,"It happened one day near December's end
Two neighbors called on an old friend
And they found his shop so meager and lean
Made gay with thousand bows of green

And Conrad was sitting with face a-shine
When he suddenly stopped as he stitched a twine
And he said ""Old friends, at dawn today
When the cock was crowing the night away
The Lord appeared in a dream to me
And said ""I'm coming your guest to be.""

So I've been busy with feet astir
Strewing my shop with branches of fern
The table is spread and the kettle is shined
And over the rafters the holly is twined

Now I'll wait for my Lord to appear
And listen closely so I will hear
His step as He nears my humble place
And I'll open the door and look on His face

So his friends went home and left Conrad alone
For this was the happiest day he had known
For long since, his family had passed away
And Conrad had spent many a sad Christmas Day

But he knew with the Lord as his Christmas Guest
This Christmas would be the dearest and best
So he listened with only joy in his heart
And with every sound he would rise with a start
And look for the Lord to be at his door
Like the vision he had had a few hours before

So he ran to the window after hearing a sound
But all he could see on the snow covered ground
Was a shabby beggar whose shoes were torn
And all of his clothes were ragged and worn

But Conrad was touched and he went to the door
And he said, ""You know, your feet must be frozen and sore
I have some shoes in my shop for you
And a coat that will keep you warmer too.""

So with grateful heart the man went away
But Conrad noticed the time of day
And wondered what made the Lord so late
And how much longer he'd have to wait

When he heard a knock, he ran to the door
But it was only a stranger once more
A bent old lady with a shawl of black
With a bundle of kindling piled on her back
She asked for only a place to rest
But that was reserved for Conrad's Great Guest

But her voice seemed to plead ""Don't send me away
Let me rest for awhile on Christmas Day""
So Conrad brewed her a steaming cup
And told her to sit at the table and sup

But after she left he was filled with dismay
For he saw that the hours were slipping away
And the Lord hadn't come as he said he would
Then Conrad felt sure he had misunderstood

When out of the stillness he heard a cry
'Please help me and tell me where am I?""
So again he opened his friendly door
And stood disappointed as twice before
It was only a child who'd wandered away
And was lost from her family on Christmas Day

Again Conrad's heart was heavy and sad
But he knew he should make the little girl glad
So he called her in and he wiped her tears
And quieted all her childish fears

Then he led her back to her home once more
But as he entered his own darkened door
He knew the Lord was not coming today
For the hours of Christmas had passed away

So he went to his room and knelt down to pray
And he said ""Dear Lord, why did you delay?
What kept you from coming to call on me?
For I wanted so much your face to see.'

When soft in the silence a voice he heard
""Lift up your head for I kept my word
Three times my shadow crossed your floor
And three times I came to your lonely door

I was the beggar with bruised, cold feet
And I was the woman you gave something to eat
I was the child on the homeless street
Three times I knocked, and three times I came in
And each time I found the warmth of a friend
Of all the gifts, love is the best
And I was honored to be your Christmas Guest"
Reba McEntire,Somehow You Do (From The Motion Picture Four Good Days),"[Verse 1]
So you feel like you've run outta hope
Carrying all that weight
Your back's about to break
And you're standing at the end of your rope
You wanna give up the fight
You see no relief in sight
And it's hard to keep the faith
But the darkest night still finds the day

[Chorus]
When you think it's the end of the road
It's just 'cause you don't know where the road's leading to
When you think that the mountain's too high
And the ocean's too wide, you'll never get through
Some way, somehow, somehow you do

[Verse 2]
So you feel like you're right on the brink
Oh, you're in the battlе alone
And life's punched a holе in your soul
Yeah, you've been brought to your knees
But there's better days up ahead
You'll be back on your feet again
And you're gonna be ok
Oh, the darkest night will find the day

[Chorus]
When you think it's the end of the road
It's just 'cause you don't know where the road's leading to
When you think that the mountain's too high
And the ocean's too wide
And you'll never get through
Some way, somehow, somehow you do

[Bridge]
'Cause it's those times, it's those times when times get bad
You'll find the strength you didn't know you even had
Somehow you'll get through this

[Chorus]
When you think it's the end of the road
It's just 'cause you don't know where the road's leading to
When you think that the mountain's too high
And the ocean's too wide
And you'll never get through
Some way, somehow, somehow you do
Some way, somehow, somehow you do"
Reba McEntire,Consider Me Gone,"[Verse 1]
Every time I turn the conversation
To something deeper than the weather
I can feel you all but shutting down
And when I need an explanation for the silence
You just tell me you don't wanna talk about it now
What you're not saying is coming in loud and clear
We're at a crossroads here

[Chorus]
If I'm not the one thing you can't stand to lose
If I'm not that arrow to the heart of you
If you don't get drunk on my kiss
If you think you can do better than this
Then I guess we're done
Let's not drag this on
Consider me gone

[Verse 2]
With you, I've always been wide open, like a window or an ocean
There is nothing I've ever tried to hide
So when you leave me not knowing where you're going
I start thinking that we're looking, we're looking at goodbye
How about a strong shot of honesty?
Don't you owe that to me?

[Chorus]
If I'm not the one thing you can't stand to lose
If I'm not that arrow to the heart of you
If you don't get drunk on my kiss
If you think you can do better than this
Then I guess we're done
Let's not drag this on
Consider me gone

[Bridge]
Consider me a memory
Consider me the past
Consider me a smile in an old photograph
Someone who used to make you laugh

[Chorus]
If I'm not the one thing you can't stand to lose
If I'm not that arrow to the heart of you
Then I guess we're done
Let's not drag this on
Consider me gone
Consider me gone
Consider me gone

[Outro]
Just consider me gone"
Reba McEntire,The Heart Won’t Lie,"[Verse 1: Reba McEntire]
Looking back over the years
Of all the things I've always meant to say
But the words didn't come easily
So many times through empty fears
Of all the nights I tried to pick up the phone
So scared of who might be answering

[Pre-Chorus: Reba McEntire]
You try to live your life from day to day
But seeing you across the room tonight
Just gives me away

[Chorus: Reba McEntire & Vince Gill, Reba McEntire]
Because the heart won't lie
Sometimes life gets in the way
But there's one thing that won't change
I know I've tried
The heart won't lie
You can live your alibi
You can see you're lost inside a foolish disguise
The heart won't lie

[Verse 2: Vince Gill]
Long after tonight
Will you still hear my voice through the radio
Old desires make us act carelessly
Long after tonight, after the fire
After the scattered ashes fly
Through the four winds blown and gone
Will you come back to me?

[Pre-Chorus: Vince Gill]
You try to live your life from day to day
But seeing you across the room tonight
Just gives me away

[Chorus: Both, Vince Gill, Reba McEntire]
Because the heart won't lie
Sometimes life gets in the way
But there's one thing that won't change
I know I've tried
The heart won't lie
You can live your alibi
You can see you're lost inside a foolish disguise
The heart won't lie
The heart won't lie"
Reba McEntire,I’ll Be,"[Verse 1]
When darkness falls upon your heart and soul
I'll be the light that shines for you
When you forget how beautiful you are
I'll be there to remind you
When you can't find your way
I'll find my way to you
When troubles come around
I will come to you

[Chorus]
I'll be your shoulder when you need someone to lean on
Be your shelter
When you need someone to see you through
I'll be there to carry you
I'll be there
I'll be the rock that will be strong for you
The one that will hold on to you
When you feel that rain falling down
When there's nobody else around
I'll be

[Verse 2]
And when you're there with no one there to hold
I'll be the arms that reach for you
And when you feel your faith is running low
I'll be there to believe in you
When all you find are lies
I'll be the truth you need
When you need someone to run to
You can run to me

[Chorus]
I'll be your shoulder when you need someone to lean on
Be your shelter
When you need someone to see you through
I'll be there to carry you
I'll be there
I'll be the rock that will be strong for you
The one that will hold on to you
When you feel that rain falling down
When there's nobody else around
I'll be

[Bridge]
I'll be the sun
When your heart's filled with rain
I'll be the one
To chase the rain away

[Chorus]
I'll be your shoulder when you need someone to lean on
Be your shelter
When you need someone to see you through
I'll be there to carry you
I'll be there
I'll be the rock that will be strong for you
The one that will hold on to you
When you feel that rain falling down
When there's nobody else around
I'll be"
Reba McEntire,Love Isn’t Love (’Til You Give It Away),"[Verse 1]
Smile's not a smile until it wrinkles your face
Bell's not a bell without ringing
A home's not a home when there's nobody there
A song's not a song without singing

[Chorus]
Love isn't love till you give it away
Love isn't love till it's free
The love in your heart
Wasn't put there to stay
Oh love isn't love till you give it away

[Verse 2]
You might think love is a treasure to keep
Feeling to cherish and hold
But love is a treasure for people to share
You keep it by letting it go

[Chorus]
Love isn't love till you give it away
Love isn't love till it's free
The love in your heart
Wasn't put there to stay
Oh love isn't love till you give it away

[Bridge]
Cause love can't survive
When it's hidden inside
And love was meant to be shared

[Chorus]
Love isn't love till you give it away
Love isn't love till it's free
The love in your heart
Wasn't put there to stay
Oh love isn't love till you give it away"
Reba McEntire,You Lie,"[Verse 1]
We lie in the dark I know you're awake
The only sounds are the sounds this old house makes
But, oh, how I long, I long to hear your voice
Desperate to talk, yearning to touch
Burning inside because I want you so much
So I say I need you and leave you no choice

[Chorus]
You lie you don't want to hurt me
So you lie, buy a little time, and I go along
What else can I do? Maybe it's wrong
But you know how much I love you
So you lie until you can find a way to say goodbye
You lie

[Verse 2]
How long until you just can't go on?
And the urge to break loose is just too strong
You should let go that's what you want to do
Oh, but you don't know, you don't know
If it's the right thing to do

[Chorus]
You lie you don't want to hurt me
So you lie, buy a little time, and I go along
What else can I do? Maybe it's wrong
But you know how much I love you
So you lie until you can find a way to say goodbye
You lie"
Reba McEntire,I Keep On Lovin’ You,"[Verse 1]
Love takes the patience of Job
That's what my Mama always said
Faith is the belief in something more than what you know
That's what the Good Book says
You got to play the cards you got
Who knows what fate is holding
At times you got to go without knowing where you're going

[Chorus]
That's why I keep on loving you
I keep on loving you
Through the baby don't-leave-mes
And never-will-agains
And I-promise-tos
I keep on loving you

[Verse 2]
Lord knows we've had our share of fights
Our sleepless nights, our ups and downs
We've had plenty and then some of baby-I'm-gones and turnarounds
Sometimes I swear it might be easier to throw in the towel
Someday we're going to look back
Say look at us now

[Chorus]
That's why I keep on loving you
I keep on loving you
Through the baby don't-leave-mes
And never-will-agains
And I-promise-tos
I keep on loving you

[Outro]
Keep on loving you
Through the I-take-it-backs, I-didn't-mean-it-like-that
I'd-never-hurt-yous
Oh, I keep on loving you
Keep on loving you
Through the I-take-it-backs, I-didn't-mean-it-like-that
I'd-never-hurt-yous
Oh, I keep on loving you"
Reba McEntire,Whoever’s In New England,"[Verse 1]
You spend an awful lot of time in Massachusetts
Seems like every other week
You've got a meeting waiting there
Business must be booming or could something else
Be moving in the air up there

[Verse 2]
You say that it's important for our future
An executive on his way up has got to play the part
And each time duty calls, you got to give it all
You've got with all your heart

[Chorus]
When whoever's in New England is through with you
And Boston finds better things to do
You know it's not too late
'Cause you'll always have a place to come back to
When whoever's in New England's through with you

[Verse 3]
I hear the winter time up north can last forever
I've been told it's beautiful to see this time of year
They say the snow can blind you till the world you left behind
Just disappears I hear

[Verse 4]
I've packed your bags and left them in the hallway
But before you leave again
There's just one thing you ought to know
When the icy wind blows through you remember that it's me
Who feels the cold most of all

[Chorus]
When whoever's in New England is through with you
And Boston finds better things to do
You know it's not too late
And you'll always have a place to come back to
When whoever's in New England's through with you"
Reba McEntire,If I Had Only Known,"[Verse 1]
If I had only known
It was the last walk in the rain
I'd keep you out for hours in the storm
I would hold your hand
Like a lifeline to my heart
Underneath the thunder, we'd be warm
If I had only known
It was our last walk in the rain

[Verse 2]
If I had only known
I'd never hear your voice again
I'd memorize each thing you ever said
And on those lonely nights
I could think of them once more
And keep your words alive inside my head
If I had only known
I'd never hear your voice again

[Bridge]
You were the treasure in my hand
You were the one who always stood beside me
So unaware
I foolishly believed that you would always be there
But then there came a day and I turned my head
And you slipped away

[Verse 3]
If I had only known
It was my last night by your side
I'd pray a miracle would stop the dawn
And when you'd smile at me
I would look into your eyes
And make sure you know my love
For you goes on and on
If I had only known
If I had only known
Oh, the love I would've shown
If I had only known"
Reba McEntire,Back to God,"[Verse 1]
Oh, have you looked around
Have you heard the sound
Of Mama's crying
Or do you turn away
When you see the face
Of the innocent dying
In these darkest days
Are you not afraid?
That it's too late

[Chorus 1]
You gotta get down on your knees
Believe, fold your hands, and beg and plead
Gotta keep on praying
You gotta cry, rain, tears of pain
Pound the floor, and scream His name
'Cause we're still worth saving
Can't go on like this, and live like this
We can't love like this
We gotta give this world
Back to God

[Verse 2]
Have you lost a love?
Do you feel like giving up?
Has your heart been broken?
Are your kids okay?
Will they come home safe?
Do you lie there hoping?
You can make a wish
You can knock on wood
Ohh, it won't do no good

[Chorus 1]
You gotta get down on your knees
Believe, fold your hands, and beg and plead
Gotta keep on praying
You gotta cry, rain, tears of pain
Pound the floor, and scream His name
'Cause we're still worth saving
Can't go on like this, and live like this
We can't love like this
We gotta give this world
Back to God

[Interlude]

[Chorus 2]
You gotta get down on your knees
Believe, fold your hands, and beg and plead
Keep on! praying
You gotta cry, rain, tears of pain
Pound the floor, and scream His name
'Cause we're still worth saving
Can't go on like this, and live like this
We can't love like this
You can hope the best
Make a wish
The only answer is
We give this world back to God
Ohh, give it back ..."
Reba McEntire,You Never Gave Up on Me,"[Verse 1]
There's only one chance in a million
Of a dream like this coming true
And I've been told I'm not the one
By everyone but you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Through all my doubts and all my fears
Well, it seemed those clouds wouldn't ever clear

[Chorus]
You never gave up on me
Oh, you never gave up on me
I'm here, where I was always meant to be
I never gave up 'cause you never gave up on me

[Verse 2]
As I stand here and look around me
And think of how far we've come
Your faith, it still astounds me
Oh, just look at what we've done

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You've held me high up off the ground
Every time this old world tried, tried to bring me down

[Chorus]
You never gave up on me
Oh, you never gave up on me
I'm here, where I was always meant to be
I never gave up 'cause you never gave up on me

[Bridge]
Everyone needs someone
Someone to believe like you believed in me

[Chorus]
You never gave up on me
No, you never gave up on me
Right here, where I was always meant to be
I never gave up 'cause you never gave up on me
You never gave up on me

[Outro]
Thank you, Mama"
Reba McEntire,Is There Life Out There,"[Verse 1]
She married when she was twenty
She thought she was ready, now she's not so sure
She thought she'd done some living
Now she's just wondering what she's living for
Now she's feeling that there's something more

[Chorus]
Is there life out there?
So much she hasn't done
Is there life beyond
Her family and her home?
She's done what she should
Should she do what she dares?
She doesn't want to leave
She's just wondering is there life out there?

[Verse 2]
She's always lived for tomorrow
She's never learned how to live for today
Oh, she's dying to try something foolish
Do something crazy or just get away
Oh, something for herself for a change

[Chorus]
Is there life out there?
So much she hasn't done
Is there life beyond
Her family and her home?
She's done what she should
Should she do what she dares?
She doesn't want to leave
She's just wondering is there life out there?

[Verse 3]
There's a place in the sun that she's never been
Where life is fair and time is a friend
Would she do it the same as she did back then?
Oh, she looks out her window and she wonders again

[Chorus]
Is there life out there?
So much she hasn't done
Is there life beyond
Her family and her home?
She's done what she should
Should she do what she dares?
She doesn't want to leave
She's just wondering is there life out there?
Oh, is there life out there?
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
Is there life out there?
So much she hasn't done
Is there life beyond
Her family and her home?
She's done what she should
Should she do what she dares?
She doesn't want to leave
She's just wondering is there life out there?
Oh, she doesn't want to leave
She's just wondering is there life out there?"
Reba McEntire,He Gets That From Me,"[Verse 1]
His early morning attitude
You have to drag him out of bed
Only frosted flakes will do

[Hook 1]
He gets that from me
Yeah, he gets that from me

[Verse 2]
His curly hair and his knobby knees
The way the sun brings those freckles out
Talk and talk and never miss a beat

[Hook 1]
Yeah, he gets that from me
He gets that from me

[Chorus 1]
He looks at me with those big brown eyes
He's got me in the palm of his hands
And I swear sometimes
It's just like you're here again
He smiles that little crooked smile
There's no denying he's your child
Without him, I don't know what I'd do

[Hook 2]
He gets that from you
Oh, he gets that from you

[Chorus 2]
How he loves your old guitar
Yeah, he's taught himself to play
He melts my heart
Tells me he loves me every day
And cracks a joke at the perfect time
Makes me laugh when I want to cry
That boy is everything to me

[Hook 2]
He gets that from you
He gets that from you

[Verse 3]
Last night I heard him pray
""Lord, help me and Momma make it through
And tell Daddy we'll be okay""

[Hook 3]
He said he sure misses you
He sure misses you
He really misses you
He gets that from me"
Reba McEntire,You’re Gonna Be (Always Loved By Me),"[Verse 1]
6lbs and 9oz. looking up at me
Like I have all the answers
I hope I have the ones you need
I've never really done this
Now I know what scared is

Sometimes I'll protect you from everything that's wrong
Other times I'll let you just find out on your own
But that's when you'll be growing
And the whole time I'll be knowing

[Chorus]
You're going to fly with every dream you chase
You're going to cry
But know that that's okay
Sometimes life's not fair
But if you hang in there
You're going to see that sometimes bad is good

We just have to believe things work out like they should
Life has no guarantees
But always loved by me
You're going to be

[Verse 2]
I'm afraid you'll have to suffer through
Some of my mistakes
Lord knows I'll be trying
Oh, to give you what it takes
What it takes to know the difference
Between getting by and living

Because anything worth doing is worth doing all the way
Just know you'll have to live with all
The choices that you make
So make sure you're always giving way
More than you're taking

[Chorus]
You're going to fly with every dream you chase
You're going to cry
But know that that's okay
Sometimes life's not fair
But if you hang in there
You're going to see that sometimes bad is good

We just have to believe things work out like they should
Life has no guarantees
But always loved by me
You're going to be

[Bridge]
Someone's everything
You're going to see
Just what you are to me

[Outro]
You're going to fly with every dream you chase
We just have to believe things work out like they should
Life has no guarantees
But always loved by me
You're going to be
Always loved by me"
Patsy Cline,Crazy,"[Verse]
Crazy, I'm crazy for feeling so lonely
I'm crazy, crazy for feeling so blue
I knew, you'd love me as long as you wanted
And then someday, you'd leave me for somebody new

[Bridge]
Worry, why do I let myself worry?
Wondering, what in the world did I do?

[Chorus]
Crazy, for thinking that my love could hold you
I'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying
And I'm crazy for loving you

[Chorus]
Crazy, for thinking that my love could hold you
I'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying
And I'm crazy for loving you"
Patsy Cline,You Belong to Me,"[Verse 1]
See the pyramids along the Nile
Watch the sunrise on a tropic isle
Just remember darling all the while
You belong to me

[Verse 2]
See the market place in Old Algiers
Send me photographs and souvenirs
Just remember when a dream appears
You belong to me

[Bridge]
I'll be so alone without you
Maybe you'll be lonesome too
And blue

[Verse 3]
Fly the ocean in a silver plane
See the jungle when it's wet with rain
Just remember until you're home again
You belong to me

[Bridge]
I'm gonna be so alone without you
And I'm hopin' you'll be lonesome too
And blue

[Verse 4]
Fly that ocean in a silver plane
See the jungle when it's wet with rain
Just remember 'til you're home again
You belong to me"
Patsy Cline,Walkin’ After Midnight,"[Verse 1]
I go out walkin' after midnight
Out in the moonlight
Just like we used to do
I'm always walkin' after midnight
Searchin' for you

[Verse 2]
I walk for miles along the highway
Well, that's just my way
Of sayin', ""I love you""
I'm always walkin' after midnight
Searchin' for you

[Chorus]
I stop to see a weepin' willow
Cryin' on his pillow
Maybe he's cryin' for me
And as the skies turn gloomy
Night winds whisper to me
I'm lonesome as I can be

[Verse 3]
I go out walkin' after midnight
Out in the starlight
Just hopin' you may be
Somewhere a-walkin' after midnight
Searchin' for me

I stop to see a weepin' willow
Cryin' on his pillow
Maybe he's cryin' for me
And as the skies turn gloomy
Night winds whisper to me
I'm lonesome as I can be

I go out walkin' after midnight
Out in the starlight
Just hopin' you may be
Somewhere walkin' after midnight
Searchin' for me"
Patsy Cline,She’s Got You,"[Verse]
I've got your picture that you gave to me
And it's signed with love, just like it used to be
The only thing different, the only thing new
I've got your picture, she's got you
I've got the records that we used to share
And they still sound the same as when you were here
The only thing different, the only thing new
I've got the records, she's got you

[Chorus]
I've got your memory or has it got me?
I really don't know but I know it won't let me be
I've got your class ring that proved you cared
And it still looks the same as when you gave it dear
The only thing different, the only thing new
I've got these little things, she's got you

[Chorus]
I've got your memory or has it got me?
I really don't know but I know it won't let me be

And it still looks the same as when you gave it dear
The only thing different, the only thing new
I've got these little things, she's got you"
Patsy Cline,Blue,"Blue, oh, so lonesome for you
Why can't you be blue over me?
Blue, oh, so lonesome for you
Tears fill my eyes 'til I can't see

Three o'clock in the mornin'
Here am I
Sitting here so lonely
So lonesome I could cry

Blue, oh, so lonesome for you
Why can't you be blue over me?

Now that it's over, I realized
Those weak words you whispered
Were nothing but lies

Blue, oh, so lonesome for you
Why can't you be blue over me?
Why can't you be blue over me?"
Patsy Cline,Just a Closer Walk With Thee,"I am weak but thou art strong
Jesus, keep me from all wrong
I'll be satisfied as long
As I walk, let me walk close to Thee

Just a closer walk with thee
Grant it, Jesus, is my plea
Daily walking close to thee
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be

And when my feeble life is o'er
And time for me shall be no more
Guide me gently, safely o'er
To thy kingdom's shore, to thy shore

Just a closer walk with thee
Grant it, Jesus, is my plea
Daily walking close to thee
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be
(Just a closer walk with Thee)"
Patsy Cline,I Fall to Pieces,"[Chorus]
I fall to pieces
Each time I see you again
I fall to pieces
How can I be just your friend?

[Verse 1]
You want me to act like we've never kissed
You want me to forget (To forget)
Pretend we've never met (Never met)
And I've tried and I've tried but I haven't yet
You walk by and I fall to pieces

[Chorus]
I fall to pieces
Each time someone speaks your name (Speaks your name)
I fall to pieces
Time only adds to the flame

[Verse 2]
You tell me to find someone else to love
Someone who'll love me too (Love me too)
The way you used to do (Used to do)
But each time I go out with someone new
You walk by and I fall to pieces

You walk by and I fall to pieces"
Patsy Cline,Three Cigarettes In An Ashtray,"[Verse]
Two cigarettes in an ashtray
My love and I, in a small cafe
Then a stranger came along
And everything went wrong
Now there's three cigarettes
In the ashtray

[Chorus]
I watched her take him from me
And his love is no longer my own
Now they are gone and I sit alone
And watch one cigarette burn away
I watched her take him from me
And his love is no longer my own
Now they are gone and I sit alone
And watch one cigarette burn away"
Patsy Cline,Strange,"[Verse]
Strange how you stopped loving me
How you stopped needing me
When she came along
Oh, how strange
Strange you changed like night and day
Just up and walked away
When she came along
Oh, how strange

[Chorus]
Well, I guess that I was just your puppet
You held on a string
To think I thought you really loved me
But look what thoughts can bring
Strange you're still in all my dreams
Oh, what a funny thing
I still care for you
Oh, how strange
Well, I guess that I was just your puppet
You held on a string
To think I thought you really loved me
But look what thoughts can bring
Strange you're still in all my dreams
Oh, what a funny thing
I still care for you
Oh, how strange

Sweet dreams of you
Every night I go through
Why can't I forget you and start my life anew

You don't love me its plain
I should know I'll never wear your ring
I should hate you the whole night through
Instead of having sweet dreams about you

Sweet dreams of you
Things I know can't come true
Why can't I forget the past, start loving someone new
Instead of having sweet dreams about you"
Patsy Cline,The Wayward Wind,"[Chorus]
Oh, the wayward wind is a restless wind
A restless wind that yearns to wander
And he was born the next of kin
The next of kin to the wayward wind

[Verse 1]
In a lonely shack by a railroad track
He spent his younger days
And I guess the sound of the outward-bound
Made him a slave to his wanderin' ways

[Chorus]
Oh, the wayward wind (The wayward wind)
Is a restless wind (A restless wind)
A restless wind that yearns to wander
And he was born the next of kin
The next of kin to the wayward wind

[Verse 2]
Oh, I met him there in a border town
He vowed we'd never part
Though he tried his best to settle down
Now I'm alone with a broken heart

[Chorus]
Oh, the wayward wind (The wayward wind)
Is a restless wind (A restless wind)
A restless wind that yearns to wander
And he was born the next of kin
The next of kin to the wayward wind
The next of kin to the wayward wind

(The wayward wind)
(The wayward wind)
(The wayward wind)"

I'm back in baby's arms
How I missed those lovin' arms
I'm back where I belong
Back in baby's arms

Don't know why we quarreled
We never did before
Since we found out how it hurt
I bet we never quarrel anymore

[Chorus]
I'm back in baby's arms
How I missed those lovin' arms
I'm back where I belong
Back in baby's arms

Now I'm back where I belong
And in my baby's arms I'm gonna stay

How I missed those lovin' arms
I'm back where I belong
Back in baby's arms
Back in baby's arms
Back in baby's arms
Back in baby's arms"
Patsy Cline,San Antonio Rose,"[Verse]
Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
Well, it was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
For that moonlit pass that only he would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor known only to my heart
Call back my rose rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals fallin' apart
Speak once again of my love, my own

[Chorus]
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And rose my rose of San Antone

[Chorus]
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And rose my rose of San Antone

And rose my rose of San Antone
And rose my rose of San Antone"
Patsy Cline,Heartaches,"Heartaches, heartaches
My loving you meant only heartaches
Your kiss was such a sacred thing to me
I can't believe it's just a burning memory

Heartaches, heartaches
What does it matter how my heart breaks
I should be happy with someone new
But my heart aches for you (My heart aches for you)

Heartaches, heartaches
My loving you meant only heartaches
Your kiss was such a sacred thing to me
I can't believe it's just a burning memory

Heartaches, heartaches
What does it matter how my heart breaks
I should be happy with someone new
But my heart aches for you

Heartaches, heartaches
What does it matter how my heart breaks
I should be happy with someone new
But my heart aches
And my heart breaks
And my heart aches
For you

Patsy Cline,If I Could See The World (Through The Eyes Of A Child),"If I could see the world
Thru the eyes of a child
What a wonderful world this would be
There'd be no trouble and no strife
Just a big happy life
With a bluebird in every tree

I could see right, no wrong
I could see good, no bad
I could see all the good things
In life I've never had
If I could see the world
Thru the eyes of a child
What a wonderful world this would be

If I could see the world
Thru the eyes of a child
Smiling faces would greet me all the while
Like a lovely work of art
It would warm my weary heart
Just to see thru the eyes of a child

I could see right, no wrong
I could see good, no bad
I could see all the good things
In life I've never had
If I could see the world
Thru the eyes of a child
What a wonderful world this would be"
Patsy Cline,Lovesick Blues,"[Verse 1]
Got a feeling because I'm blue, oh, Lord
Since my daddy said goodbye
I don't know what I'm going to do
All I do is sit and cry, oh, lord
That last long day he said goodbye
Oh, Lord, I thought I would die
He'll do you, he'll do me
He's got that kinda loving
But, Lord, I love to hear him
When he calls me sweet baby
What a beautiful dream
I hate to think it all over
I lost my heart it seems

[Chorus]
I've grown so used to that man, somehow
And I'm nobody's sugar-baby now
Because I'm lonesome
I got the lovesick blues

[Verse 2]
Now I'm in love
I'm in love with a wonderful guy
That's what's the matter with me
Well, I'm in love
I'm in love with a wonderful guy
But he don't care about me
Well, I tried and I tried to keep him satisfied
But he just wouldn't stay
But now that he is leaving
This is all I've got to say
I got a feeling cause I'm blue, oh Lord
Since my daddy said goodbye
I don't know what I'm going to do
I lost my heart it seems

[Chorus][x2]"

Afraid of losing you

And there's nothing I can do
I want to hold you my dear, forever and ever
I love you so much, it hurts me so"

As I look at the letters that you wrote to me
It's you that I am thinking of

I miss you, darling, more and more everyday
As Heaven would miss the stars above
With every heartbeat, I still think of you
And remember our faded love

As I think of the past and all the pleasures we had
As I watched the mating of the dove
It was in the spring time that you said goodbye
I remember our faded love

As Heaven would miss the stars above
With every heartbeat, I still think of you
And remember our faded love

Patsy Cline,You Made Me Love You (I Didn’t Want to Do It),"[Verse]
You made me love you
I didn't want to do it
I didn't want to do it
You made me want you
And all the time you knew it
I guess you always knew it
You made me happy sometimes
Sometimes you made me glad
But there were times, dear
You made me feel so bad

[Chorus][x2]
You made me sigh for
I didn't want to tell you
I didn't want to tell you

You know you got the brand of kisses that I'd die for
You know you made me love you"

He takes me to the places you
And I used to go
He tells me over and over
That he loves me so

He gives me love
That I never got from you
He loves me too, his love is true
Why can't he be you?

He never fails to call and tell
Me I'm on his mind
And I'm lucky to have such a guy
I hear it all the time

[Chorus 2]
And he does all the things
That you would never do
He loves me too, his love is true
Why can't he be you?

[Bridge]
He's not the one
Who dominates
My mind and soul
And I should love him so
'Cause he loves me, I know
But his kisses leave me cold

He sends me flowers, calls on the hour
Just to prove his love
And my friends say when he's around
I'm all he speaks of

And he does all the things
That you would never do
He loves me too, his love is true
Why can't he be you?"
Patsy Cline,South of the Border (Down Mexico Way),"[Intro]
Ay ay ay ay[x2]

[Verse]
South of the border, down Mexico way
That's where they fell in love when stars above came out to play
And now as they wander, their thoughts ever stray
South of the border, down Mexico way
She was a picture in old Spanish lace
Just for a tender while he kissed the smile upon her face
For it was Fiesta and they were so gay
South of the border, down Mexico way
Then she sighed as she whispered ""Manana""
Never dreaming that they were parting
And he lied as he whispered ""Manana""
For that tomorrow never came
South of the border, he rode back one day
There in a veil of white by candlelight she knelt to pray
The mission bells told him that he mustn't stay
South of the border, down Mexico way

[Outro]
Ay ay ay ay[x4]"

Patsy Cline,I’ve Got Your Picture,"I've got your picture
That you gave to me
And it's signed with love
Just like it used to be
The only thing different, the only thing new

That we used to share
And they still sound the same

Jimmie Rodgers,In the Jailhouse Now,"[Verse 1]
I had a friend named Ramblin' Bob
Who used to steal, gamble and rob
He thought he was the smartest guy in town
But I found out last Monday
That Bob got locked up Sunday
They've got him in the jailhouse way downtown

Pinochle, Whist and Euchre
But shooting dice was his greatest game
Now he's downtown in jail
Nobody to go his bail
The judge done said that he refused the fine

I told him once or twice
To quit playing cards and shooting dice

Met a girl named Susie
I told her I was the swellest man around
We started to spend my money
Then she started to call me honey
We took in every cabaret in town

We're in the jailhouse now, we're in the jailhouse now
I told the judge right to his face
We didn't like to see this place
We're in the jailhouse now

All around the water tank
Waiting for a train
A thousand miles away from home
Sleeping in the rain
I walked up to a brakeman
To give him a line of talk

Not a penny can I show

A state I dearly love
The wide open spaces all around me
The moon and stars up above

I'm going back to Dixieland
Though my pocketbook is empty
And my heart is full of pain
I'm a thousand miles away from home
Just waiting for a train

Jimmie Rodgers,Frankie and Johnny,"Frankie and Johnny was sweethearts, oh Lord how they did love
Swore to be true to each other, true as the stars above
He was her man, he wouldn't do her wrong

Frankie went down to the corner, just for a bucket of beer
She says, Mr Bartender has my loving Johnny been here
He's my man, he wouldn't do me wrong

I don't want cause you no trouble, I ain't gonna tell you no lie
I saw your lover an hour ago with a gal named Nellie Bligh
He was your man, but he's doing you wrong

Frankie looked over the transom, she saw to her surprise
There on a cot sat Johnny, making love to Nellie Bligh
He is my man, and he's doing me wrong

Frankie drew back her kimono, she took out a little 44
Rooty toot toot, three times she shot, right through that hardwood door
Shot her man, he was doing her wrong

Bring out the rubber tied buggy, bring out the rubber tied hack
I'm taking my man to the graveyard, but I ain't gonna bring him back
Lord, he was my man, and he done me wrong

Bring out a thousand policemen, bring 'em around today
To lock me down in the dungeon cell, and throw that key away
I shot my man, he was doing me wrong

Frankie said to the warden what are they going to do
The warden he said to Frankie, it's electric chair for you
Cause you shot your man, he was doing you wrong

This story has no moral, this story has no end
This story just goes to show, that there ain't no good in men
He was her man, and he done her wrong"

Ho-ho hey-hey, the gamblin' bar room blues

[Verse 1]
I went down to the corner just to meet my gal
I found her standin' on the sidewalk talkin' to my pal
I strolled back to the bar room to get another drink of gin
But the first thing I knew I was reelin', rockin' and drunk again

[Verse 2]
I kept drinkin' gin and liquor 'till way up in the night
When my pal walked into the bar room we had an awful fight
I reached down for my razor, and then we knocked around
But when I pulled my pistol I quickly smoked him down

Hey hee hey-ho, ho hoo-hoo
Hoo-oo hoo-oo, hoo-ho, hoo hey-ho

I started down to the station and stopped in at the bar
There I met a policeman riding in a motor car

[Verse 4]
We both drank lots of liquor, that flatfooted cop and I
I thought he would never leave me, Lord, I thought I'd die
My baby came in to join us, and then it began to rain
Then I had to hurry-hurry to catch that midnight train

[Verse 5]
I laid my head in the bar room door, I'll never get drunk anymore
I've pawned my watch and my golden chain, I've pawned my baby's diamond ring

I'll grab that old eight-wheeler and make for the deep blue sea"
Jimmie Rodgers,"Mother, The Queen of My Heart","[Verse 1]
I had a home out in Texas
Down where the bluebonnets grew
I had the kindest old mother
How happy we were just we two
'Til one day the angels called her
That debt we all have to pay
She called me close to her bedside
These last few words to say

[Verse 2]
Son don't start drinking and gambling
Promise you'll always go straight
Ten years have passed since that parting
That promise I've broke I must say
I started gambling for pastime
At last I was just like them all
I bet my clothes and my money
Not dreaming that I'd ever fall

[Verse 3]
One night I bet all my money
Nothing was left to be seen
And all that I needed to break them
Was one card and that was a queen
The cards were dealt all round the table
Each man took a card on the draw
I drew the one that would beat them
I turned it and here's what I saw

[Verse 4]
I saw my mother's picture
And somehow she seemed to say
Son you have broken your promise
So I tossed the cards away
My winnings I gave to a newsboy
I knew I was wrong from the start
And I'll never forget that promise
To my Mother the queen of my heart

Jimmie Rodgers,Hobo Bill’s Last Ride,"[Chorus]
Hobo Billy

[Verse 1]
Riding on the eastbound freight train speeding through the night
Hobo Bill, a railroad bum, was fighting for his life
The sadness of his eyes revealed the torture of his soul
He raised a weak and weary hand to brush away the coal

[Chorus]
Hobo Billy

[Verse 2]
No warm lights flickered around him, no blankets there to fold
Nothing but the howling wind the driving rain so cold
When he heard a whistle blowing in a dreamy kind of way
The hobo seemed contented for he smiled there where he lay

[Chorus]
Hobo Bill

[Verse 3]
Outside the rain was falling on that lonely boxcar door
But the little form of Hobo Bill lay still upon the floor
While the train sped through the darkness and the raging storm outside
No one knew that Hobo Bill was taking his last ride

[Chorus]
*Train Whistle*

[Verse 4]
It was early in the morning when they raised the hobo's head
The smile still lingered on his face but Hobo Bill was dead
There was no mother's longing to soothe his weary soul
For he was just a railroad bum who died out in the cold

[Chorus]
*Train Whistle*"
Jimmie Rodgers,T.B. Blues,"[Verse 1]

Lord my gal's trying to make a fool out of me
Trying to make me believe I ain't got that old TB

When it rained down sorrow it rained all over me
Cause my body rattles like a train on that old SP
I've got the TB blues

Got that old TB I can't eat a bite
Got me worried so I can't even sleep at night

I've been fightin' like a lion looks like I'm going to lose

Jimmie Rodgers,Pistol Packin’ Papa,"I'm a pistol packin' papa
And when I walk down the street
You can hear those mamas shoutin'
Don't turn your gun on me

Now girls, I'm just a good guy
And I'm going to have my fun
And if you don't wanna smell my smoke
Don't monkey with my gun

Like a hobo when he's hungry
Like a drunk man when he's full
I'm a pistol packin' papa
I know how to shoot the bull

The hold-up men all know me
And they sure leave me be
I'm a pistol packin' papa
And I ramble where I please

When I have that funny feeling
That lorrying rambler's call
I swing aboard some freight train
And I shoot my pistol off

Sometimes one shot will do me
Sometime takes four or five
Sometimes I shoot all around
Before I'm satisfied

When you hear my pistol poppin'
You better hide yourself someplace
'Cause I ain't made for stoppin'
And I come from a shootin' race

My sweetheart understands me
She says I am her big shot
I'm her pistol packin' daddy
And I know I've got the drop

You can hear my new sport roadster
You can take my hardboil hat
But you can't never take from me
My silver-mounted gat

I'm a pistol packin' papa
I'm going to have my fun
Just follow me and you will hear
The barking of my gun"

She's long she's tall she's six feet from the ground

She's tailor made Lord she ain't no hand me down

Oh-di-lay-ee-ay, di-lay-dee-oh, de-lay-ee

Jimmie Rodgers,A Drunkard’s Child,"[Verse 1]
My father is a drunkard my mother she is dead
And I am just an orphan child no place to lay my head
All through this world I wander they drive me from their door
Someday I'll find a welcome on heaven's golden shore

[Verse 2]
Now if to me you'll listen I'll tell a story sad
How drinking rum and the gambling hell have stole away my dad
My mother she is in heaven where God and the angels smile
And now I know she's watching her lonely orphan child

[Chorus]
[?]

[Verse 3]
We were once so happy and had a happy home
Till daddy went to drinking rum and then he gambled some
He left my darling mother she died of a broken heart
And as I tell my story I can see your teardrops start

[Verse 4]
Don't weep for me and mother although I know it is sad
But try to find someone to cheer and save my poor lonely dad
I'm awful cold and hungry she closed her eyes and sighed
Then those who heard her story knew the orphan child had died

[Chorus]

Jimmie Rodgers,Blue Yodel No. 6 (She Left Me This Mornin’),"She left me this morning
Midnight was turning day
She left me this morning
Midnight turning day
I didn't have no blues
Until my good gal went away

I got the blues like midnight
The moon shining bright as day
I got the blues like midnight
Oh, The moon shines bright as day
I wish a Tornado
Would blow my blues away

One of these mornings
I'm gonna leave this town
One of these mornings
I'm gonna leave this town
'Cause you triflin' women
Really keep a good man down"
Jimmie Rodgers,Mississippi Delta Blues,"With friends around and even pals that I know are true
Still I'm lonely, homesick and blue
There's no one who can cheer me when I'm alone
Longing for my Mississippi home

Way down in the delta on that Mississippi shore
In that muddy water, I long to be once more
When night shadows creep about and the whippoorwill call
You can hear old mammy shout, ""Come in here, you all""

Way down on the levee, strolling in the pale moon light
You can see those steamboats and the fields of snowy white
That's a feeling I can't lose that muddy water in my shoes
When I get that Mississippi Delta blues

I long to hear them talk and sing those old melodies
Swanee River and Ol' Black Joe
That sweet magnolia perfume floating on the breeze
Way down south is where I long to go

Way down in the delta on that Mississippi shore
In that muddy water, I long to be once more
When night shadows creep about and the whippoorwill call
You can hear old mammy shout, ""Come in here, you all""

Way down on the levee, strolling in the pale moon light
You can see those steamboats and the fields of snowy white
That's a feeling I can't lose that muddy water in my shoes
When I get that Mississippi Delta blues"
Jimmie Rodgers,My Rough and Rowdy Ways,"For years and years I've rambled drank my wines and gambled
But one day I thought I'd settle down
I met a perfect lady she said she'd be my baby
We built a cottage in the old hometown
But somehow I can't forget my good old rambling days
The railroad trains are calling me away

I may be rough I may be wild I may be tough and countrified
But I can't give up my good old rough and rowdy ways
Sometimes I meet a bounder who knew me when I was a rounder
He grabs my hand and says boy have a drink
We'd go down to the poolroom get in the gang and then soon
The daylight comes before I'd had a wink
But somehow I can't forget..."
Jimmie Rodgers,Any Old Time,"I just received your letter
You're down and out, you say
At first I thought I would tell you
To travel on the other way

But in my memory lingers
All you once were to me
I'm going to give you another chance
To prove what you can be

Any old time you wanna come back home
Drop me a line and say no more you'll roam
You had your chance to play the game fair
And when you left me, sweetheart, you only left a load of care

Now that you're down
I'm going to stick by you
If you will only say
Your roaming days are through

You'll find me here
Like the day you left me alone
Any old time
You wanna come back home

You'll find me here
Like the day you left me alone
Any old time
You wanna come back home, home, home"
Jimmie Rodgers,Prairie Lullaby,"Shadows slowly creeping down the prairie trail
Everything is sleeping - ah, but the nightingale

Moon will soon be climbing in the purple sky
Night winds all a-humming this tender lullaby

Cares of the day have fled
My little sleepyhead
Stars are in the sky
Time that the prayers were said
My little sleepyhead
To a prairie lullaby

Saddle up your pony
Sandman's here
To guide you down the trail of dreams
Tumble in bed my tired
My little sleepyhead
To a prairie lullaby

Saddle up your pony
Sandman's here
To guide you down the trail of dreams
Tumble in bed my tired
My little sleepyhead
To a prairie lullaby"
Jimmie Rodgers,Hobo’s Meditation,"Tonight as I lay on a boxcar
Just waiting for a train to pass by
What will become of the hobo
Whenever that time comes to die

Has the Master up yonder in heaven
Got a place that we might call our home
Will we have to work for a living
Or can we continue to roam

Will there be any freight trains in heaven
Any boxcars in which we might hide
Will there be any tough cops and brakemen
Will they tell us we cannot ride

Will the hobo chum with the rich man
Will we always have money to spare
Will they have respect for a hobo
In the land that lies hidden up there"
Jimmie Rodgers,No Hard Times,"I got a barrel of flour Lord I got a bucket of lard
I got a barrel of flour Lord I got a bucket of lard
I ain't got no blues got chickens in my backyard

Got corn in my crib cotton growin' in my patch
I got corn in my crib cotton growin' in my patch
I got that old hen a sittin' waitin' for that old hen to hatch
Yodel lyee-oh hard time blues

[Instrumental]

I'm gonna hitch up my mule and take a holt of my line
I'm gonna hitch up my mule and take a holt of my line
I can't be bothered with all those old hard times

Oh, go ahead and pick one now

[Instrumental]

I'm gonna build me a shanty Lord I'm gonna settle down
I'm gonna build me a shanty Lord I'm gonna settle down
Get me a corn fed mama and Lordy quit a runnin round

I can make more money with my pick and plow
I can make more money with my pick and plow
With my one-eyed mule and my good ole Jersey cow

Jimmie Rodgers,Desert Blues,"Way out on the windswept desert where nature favors no man
The buffalo found his brother at rest on the sun-baked sand
He said, my brother, what ails you? Has sickness got you this way?
But his brother never said, for his brother was dead
Been dead since way last May

(yodel) Oh-de-lay-ee, ah-ee. oh-ay-ee

Here’s to Chief Big Buffalo Nickel, a mighty man in his day
Never once used a sickle to clear the bushes away
He would go ‘round from tent to tent, eat everything in sight
He loved a squaw, every one he saw
He loved a new one every night

(yodel) Oh-de-lay-ee, ah-ee. oh-ay-ee

Last night on the windswept desert I heard a big Indian moan
I left my tent, I knew what it meant, and I swore I’d never more roam
It was dawn when I reached safety, my legs were certainly sore
I must of lost fifty pounds on that hot desert ground
And I’d lose that many more

(yodel) Oh-de-lay-ee, ah-ee, oh-ay-ee-ee-day-ee-ee"
Waylon Jennings,Outlaw Shit,"[Verse 1]
I'm for law and order
The way that it should be
This song's about the night they spent
Protecting you from me
Someone called us outlaws
In some old magazine
New York sent a posse down
Like I ain't never seen

[Chorus]
Don't you think this outlaw shit
Has gotten out of hand?
What started out to be a joke
The law don't understand
Was it singing through my nose
That got me busted by the man?
This ain't it, this outlaw shit
Has gotten out of hand
Out of hand
Out of hand

[Verse 2]
We were wrapped up in the music
That's why we never saw
The cars pull up, the boys get out
And the room fill up with law
They came pounding through the back door
In the middle of my song
They got me for possession
Of something that was long gone

[Chorus]
Don't you think this outlaw shit
Has gotten out of hand?
What started out to be a joke
The law don't understand
Was it singing through my nose
That got me busted by the man?
This ain't it, this outlaw shit
Has gotten out of hand
Out of hand
Out of hand"
Waylon Jennings,Are You Sure Hank Done It This Way,"[Verse 1]
Lord, it's the same old tune, fiddle and guitar
Where do we take it from here?
Rhinestone suits and new shiny cars
It's been the same way for years
We need to change

[Verse 2]
Somebody told me when I came to Nashville
""Son, you finally got it made!
Old Hank made it here, we're all sure that you will""
But I don't think Hank done it this way, no
I don't think Hank done it this way, okay

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Ten years on the road making one night stands
Speeding my young life away
Tell me one more time, just so's I'll understand
Are you sure Hank done it this way?
Did old Hank really do it this a-way?

[Verse 4]
Lord, I've seen the world with a five-piece band
Looking at the back side of me
Singing my songs and one of his now and then
But I don't think Hank done 'em this way, no
I don't think Hank done 'em this way

[Outro]
Take it home"
Waylon Jennings,Waymore’s Blues,"Well, I woke up this mornin' it was drizzlin' rain
Around the curve come a passenger train
Heard somebody yodel and a hobo moan
Jimmy he's dead, he's been a long time gone
Been a long time gone, a long time gone

If you want to get to heaven, gotta D-I-E
You gotta put on your coat and T-I-E
Want to get the rabbit out of the L-O-G
You gotta make a commotion like D-O-G
Like D-O-G, like D-O-G, yeah

Well, I got a good woman, what's the matter with me?
What makes me want to love every woman I see?
I was trifling when I met her now I'm trifling again
And every woman she sees looks like the place I came in
Looks like the place I came in place I came in

I got my name painted on my shirt
I ain't no ordinary dude
I don't have to work
I don't have to work"
Waylon Jennings,Good Hearted Woman,"[Verse 1]
A long time forgotten our dreams had just fell by the way
And the good life he promised ain't what she's livin' today
But she never complains of the bad times or bad things he's done, Lord
She just talks about the good times they've had and all the good times to come

[Chorus]
She's a good hearted woman in love with a good timin' man
She loves him in spite of his ways that she don't understand
Through teardrops and laughter they'll pass through this world, hand in hand
A good hearted woman, lovin' her good timin' man

[Verse 2]
He likes the night life, bright lights and good timin' friends
When the party's all over she'll welcome him back home again
Lord knows she don't understand him but she does the best that she can
'Cause she's a good hearted woman, she loves her good timin' man

[Chorus]
She's a good hearted woman in love with a good timin' man
She loves him in spite of his ways that she don't understand
Through teardrops and laughter they'll pass through this world, hand in hand
A good hearted woman, lovin' her good timin' man
She's a good hearted woman in love with a good timin' man
She loves me in spite of my ways that she don't understand
Through teardrops and laughter they'll pass through this world, hand in hand
A good hearted woman, lovin' her good timin' man"
Waylon Jennings,I’ve Always Been Crazy,"I've always been crazy and the trouble that it's put me through
Been busted for things that I did, and I didn't do
I can't say I'm proud of all of the things that I've done
But I can say I've never intentionally hurt anyone

I've always been different with one foot over the line
Winding up somewhere one step ahead or behind
It ain't been so easy but I guess I shouldn't complain
I've always been crazy but it's kept me from going insane

Beautiful lady are you sure that you understand
The chances your taking loving a free living man
Are you really sure you really want what you see
Be careful of something that's just what you want it to be

I've always been crazy but it's kept me from going insane
Nobody knows if it's something to bless or to blame
So far I ain't found a rhyme or a reason to change
I've always been crazy but it's kept me from going insane"
Waylon Jennings,Honky Tonk Heroes,"[Verse]
Low down leavin' sun
Done did everything that needs done
Woe is me, why can't I see
I'd best be leavin' well enough alone?
Them neon light nights, couldn't stay out of fights
Keep a-hauntin' me in memories
Well, there's one in every crowd, for cryin' out loud
Why was it always turnin' out to be me?

[Chorus]
Where does it go? The good Lord only knows
It seems like it was just the other day
I was down at Green Gables, a-hawkin' them tables
And generally blowin' all my hard earned pay
Piano roll blues, danced holes in my shoes
There weren't another other way to be
For lovable losers, no account boozers
And honky tonk heroes like me, hey, hey

Waylon Jennings,Willy the Wandering Gypsy and Me,"[Verse 1]
Three fingers whiskey pleasures the drinkers
And moving does more than the same thing for me
Willy he tells me that doers and thinkers
Say moving is the closest thing to being free
Well he's rosined his riggings and laid back his wages
He's dead set on ridin' the big rodeo
My woman's tight with an overdue baby
And Willy keeps yelling, ""Hey, Gypsy, let's go""

[Chorus]
Willy, you're wild as a Texas Blue Norther
Ready rolled from the same makings as me
Well, I reckon we're gonna ramble 'til Hell freezes over
Willy the wandering Gypsy and me

[Verse 2]
Now, ladies, we surely will take of your favors
And we'll surely warn you there never will be
A single soul living that could put brand or handle
On Willy the wandering Gypsy and me
We'll dance on the mountains, shout in the canyons
And swarm in a loose herd like wild buffalo
Jammin' our heads full of figures and angles
And tellin' us stuff that we already know

Willy, you're wild as a Blue Texas Norther
Ready rolled from the same makings as me
Well, I reckon we're gonna ramble 'til Hell freezes over

Waylon Jennings,Lonesome On’ry and Mean,"[Verse 1]
On a Greyhound bus
Lord, I'm traveling this morning
I'm going to Shreveport
And down to New Orleans
Been traveling these highways
Been doing things my way
It's been making me lonesome, ornery, and mean

[Verse 2]
Now her hair was jet black
And her name was Codeine
She thought she was the cream
Of the Basin Street Queens
She got tired of that smoky wine dream
Began to feel lonesome, ornery, and mean

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
We got together
And we cashed in our sweeps
Gave 'em to a beggar
Who was mumblin' through the streets
There's no escaping from his snowy white dreams
Born lookin' lonesome, ornery, and mean

[Verse 4]
Now I'm down in this valley
Where the wheels turn so low
At dawn I pray
To the Lord of my soul
I say, ""Dear Lord, do right by me
You know I'm tired of being lonesome, ornery, and mean"""
Waylon Jennings,I Ain’t Living Long Like This,"[Verse 1]
I looked for trouble and I found it, son
Straight down the barrel of a lawman's gun

""You make one move and you're a dead man, friend""
Ain't living long like this
Can't live at all like this, can I baby?

He slipped the handcuffs on behind my back
Then left me reeling on a steel rail rack

Ain't living long like this
Can't live at all like this, can I baby?

Grew up in Houston off of Wayside Drive
Son of a carhop at some all night dive
Dad drove a stock car to an early death
All I remember was a drunk man's breath
Ain't living long like this
Can't live at all like this, can I baby?

[Verse 4]
You know the story how the wheel goes 'round
Don't let them take you to the man downtown
Can't sleep at all in a jailhouse, baby
Ain't living long like this
Can't live at all like this, can I baby?

[Bridge]

[Verse 5]
I live with Angel, she's a roadhouse queen
Makes Texas Ruby look like Sandra Dee
I want to love her but I don't know how
I'm at the bottom of the jailhouse now
Ain't living long like this
Can't live at all like this, can I baby?

Can't live at all like this, can I baby?"
Waylon Jennings,Black Rose,"[Verse 1]
Way down in Virginia
Amongst the tall grown sugar canes
Lived a simple man and a dominicker hen
And a rose of a different name
Well, the first time I felt lightning
I was standing in the drizzling rain
With a trembling hand and a bottle of gin
And a rose of a different name

[Chorus]
Well, the devil made me do it the first time
The second time I done it on my own
Lord, put a handle on a simple-headed man
And help me leave that black rose alone

[Verse 2]
When the devil made that woman
Lord, he threw the pattern away
She was built for speed with the tools you need
To make a new fool every day
Way down deep and dirty
On the darker side of shame
I caught a cane cuttin' man and a bottle of gin
With a rose of a different name

[Chorus]
The devil made me do it the first time
The second time I done it on my own
Lord, put a handle on a simple-headed man
Help me leave that black rose alone
Devil made me do it the first time
Second time I done it on my own
Lord, put a handle on a simple-headed man
Help me leave that black rose alone"
Waylon Jennings,Rebel Soldier,"Oh Polly Oh Polly its for your sake alone
I have left my old Father, my Country, my home
I have left my old Mother to weep and to mourn
I am a rebel soldier, and far from my home

The grape shot and musket and the cannons lumber lie
Its many a mangled body the blanket for the shroud
Its many a mangled body left on the fields alone
I am a rebel soldier and far from my home

Here is a good old cup of brandy and a glass of wine
You can drink to your true love and I will drink to mine
You can drink to your true love and I will lament and moan
I am a rebel soldier and far from my home

I will build me a castle on some green mountain high
Where I can see Polly when she is passing by
Where I can see Polly and help her to mourn
I am a rebel soldier and far from my home"

Up there where that green grass grows

Got a girl in Cincinatti
Waitin' where the Ohio River flows

Still do

Waylon Jennings,You Ask Me To,"Long ago and far away
In my ol' common labor shoes
I turned the world all which a way
Just because you asked me to

Like unto no other feel
Simple love is simple true
There's no end to what I'd do
Just because you asked me to

Let the world call me a fool
But if things are right with me and you
That's all that matters
And I'll do anything you asked me to

Knowing how much I love you
And after all that I've been through
I'd turn and walk away from you
Just because you asked me to
(Lord. I hope you'll never do.)

Let the world call me a fool
But if things are right with me and you
That's all that matters
And I'll do anything you asked me to"

Fate should have made you a gentleman's wife
Amanda, light of my life
Fate should have made you a gentleman's wife

[Verse 2]
It's a measure of people who don't understand
The pleasures of life in a hillbilly band
I got my first guitar when I was fourteen
Now I'm over thirty, still wearing jeans

[Chorus]
Amanda, light of my life
Fate should have made you a gentleman's wife
Amanda, light of my life
Fate should have made you a gentleman's wife"
Waylon Jennings,Don’t You Think This Outlaw Bit’s Done Got Out Of Hand,"[Verse 1]
I'm for the law and order the way that it should be
This song's about the night they spent protecting you from me
Someone called us outlaws in some old magazine
New York sent a posse down like I ain't never seen

[Chorus]
Don't you think this outlaw bit's done got out of hand?
What started out to be a joke, the law don't understand
Was it singing through my nose that got me busted by the man?
Maybe this here outlaw bit's done got out of hand...
Out of hand! (Woo!)

[Verse 2]
We were wrapped up in our music – that's why we never saw
The car pulls up, the boys get out, and the room fill up with law
They came boundin' through the backdoor in the middle of the song
They got me for possession of something that was gone
Long gone

[Chorus]
Don't you think this outlaw bit's done got out of hand?
What started out to be a joke, the law don't understand
Was it singing through my nose that got me busted by the man? Oh, Lord...
Maybe this here outlaw bit's done got out of hand... (Woo!)

Don't you think this outlaw bit's done got out of hand?
Out of hand!

Waylon Jennings,Drinkin’ And Dreamin’,"[Verse 1:]
Everybody's lookin' for some way in
I'm lookin' for some way out
I've been wastin' my time standin' in line
If this is what it's all about
All I got is a job that I don't like
And a woman that don't understand
So tonight at the bar
I'll get in my car
And take off for the promised land

[Chorus:]
Drinkin' and dreamin'
Knowin' damn well I can't go
I'll never see Texas, L.A., or Old Mexico
But here at this table, I'm able to leave it behind
Drink 'til I'm dreamin', a thousand miles out of my mind

[Verse 2:]
This suit and this tie, is just a disguise
This ain't really me
Some people are born, to be tied down
Some people are born to be free
When I look down the road she don't know
How it gets under my skin
She's got my body but my heart and soul
Are out there ridin' the wind

[Chorus][x2]"
Waylon Jennings,Bob Wills is Still the King,"[Verse 1]
Well the honky-tonks in Texas were my natural second home
Where you tip your hats to the ladies and the rose of San Antone
I grew up on music that we called western swing
It don't matter who's in Austin, Bob Wills is still the king

[Verse 2]
Lord, I can still remember the way things were back then
In spite of all the hard times, I'd live it all again
To hear the Texas playboys and Tommy Duncan sing
Makes me proud to be from Texas where Bob Wills is still the king

[Chorus 1]
You can hear the Grand Old Opry in Nashville Tennessee
It's the home of country music, on that we all agree
But when you cross that old Red River hoss, that just don't mean a thing
Because once you're down in Texas, Bob Wills is still the king

[Chorus 2]
Well if you ain't never been there then I guess you ain't been told
That you just can't live in Texas unless you got a lot of soul
It's the home of Willie Nelson, the home of western swing
He'll be the first to tell you, Bob Wills is still the king"
Waylon Jennings,Trouble Man,"[Verse 1]
I was so ugly the doctor slapped my momma when I was born
Then he took out his pocket knife and cut off my horns
He said, ""Lady if you ain't already picked out a name
Go ahead on and call him Trouble Man""

[Chorus]
He's gonna be wild
I'm giving you warning
He's gotta have room
Keep an eye on him

[Verse 2]
I grew up with long and lean and hungry looks
I learned you can't go nowhere when you go by the book
People all around me earthbound, I learned how to fly
Upside, downside, outside, sailing on by

[Chorus]
Out of my reach
Out of my hands
Out of control
Trouble Man

[Verse 3]
I've been so far in all directions as you can get
I ain't never had enough of anything yet
I have women that tore me apart without any reason
I say, ""Baby I don't get mad I just get even""

[Outro]
I don't explain
If you don't understand
I'm my own man
Trouble Man
Trouble man"
Waylon Jennings,If You See Me Getting Smaller,"[Verse 1:]
Willie, we've been constant companions
You know the light and shade
We have spent a million dollars
To find out what we made
We have made the maidens marvel
The things we do and say
Down, down and out, brother
Up, up and away

[Chorus:]
If you see me gettin' smaller, I'm leavin'
Don't be grieving
Just got to get away from here
If you see me gettin' smaller, don't worry
I'm in no hurry
I've got the right to disappear

[Verse 2:]
God bless old Philadelphia
They were standing in the rain
Out in front of the Main Point
A wet and lonely train
Who knows who they came to see
A mad man full of beer
A four piece band and a charter bus
Myborderline career

[Chorus]"
Waylon Jennings,Ain’t No God in Mexico,"[Verse 1]
Down the road a ways I've heard say a new day's coming on
Where the women folks are friendly and the law leaves you alone
I'll believe it when I see it and I haven't seen it yet
Don't mind me, just keep on talking, I'm just looking for my hat

[Chorus 1]
Ain't no God in Mexico, ain't no way to understand
How that border crossing feeling makes a fool out of a man
If I'd never felt the sunshine, hell, I would not curse the rain
If my feet could fit a railroad track I guess I'd been a train

[Verse 2]
Me and Louise Higginbotham used to chase across the yard
Back in 1947, that's when more than times were hard
Well, pity me, I didn't find the line in time like a fool
In front of God and everybody I politely blew my cool

[Chorus 2]
Ain't no God in Mexico, ain't no comfort in the cane
When you're down in Matamoros gettin' busted by the man
If I'd never felt the sunshine, hell, I would not curse the rain
If I hadn't been railroaded, well, I guess I'da been a train"
Waylon Jennings,A Long Time Ago,"[Verse 1]
I don't look the way the average cowboy singer looks
I'll admit I've taken things I never should have took
You can read a different story in a lot of different books
But even then you won't really know
How it was a long time ago

[Verse 2]
Women have been my trouble since I found out they weren't men
In spite of that I stopped and took a wife now and then
They built their fences high but they couldn't hold me in
I was born with a fire down below
And I learned to fly a long time ago, yeah

[Verse 3]
Don't ask me about the years I spent out in the rain
About the ones I spent in love or the ones I spent insane
Don't ask me who I gave my seat to on that plane
I think you already know
I told you that a long time ago

[Verse 4]
Me and ol' Willie, lordy we've been sold and bought
I guess y'all heard about some kind of system that we fought
We ain't the only outlaws just the only ones they caught
They tried to run us off but Willie's slow
I quit running a long time ago"
Waylon Jennings,Dreaming My Dreams With You,"[Verse 1]
I hope that I won't be that wrong anymore
And maybe I've learned this time
I hope that I find what I'm reaching for
The way that it is in my mind

[Chorus]
Someday I'll get over you
I'll live to see it all through
But I'll always miss
Dreaming my dreams with you

[Verse 2]
But I won't let it change me
Not if I can
I'd rather believe in love
And give it away as much as I can
To those that I'm fondest of

[Chorus]
Someday I'll get over you
I'll live to see it all through
But I'll always miss
Dreaming my dreams with you
Someday I'll get over you
I'll live to see it all through
But I'll always miss
Dreaming my dreams with you"
The Carter Family,Can the Circle Be Unbroken,"I was standing by the window
On one cold and cloudy day
And I saw the hearse come rolling
For to carry my mother away

Can the circle be unbroken
By and by Lord, by and by
There's a better home awaiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

Lord, I told the undertaker
Undertaker please drive slow
For this body you are hauling
Lord, I hate to see her go

Can the circle be unbroken
Bye and bye Lord, bye and bye
There's a better home awaiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

Oh, I followed close behind her
Tried to hold up and be brave
But I could not hide my sorrow
When they laid her in the grave

Can the circle be unbroken
Bye and bye Lord, bye and bye
There's a better home awaiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

I went back home, Lord, my home was lonesome
Since my mother, she was gone
All my brothers and sisters crying
What a home so sad and alone

Can the circle be unbroken
Bye and bye Lord, bye and bye
There's a better home awaiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

We sang songs of childhood
Hymns of faith that made us strong
Ones that mother Maybelle taught us
Hear the angels sing along

Will the circle be unbroken
Bye and bye Lord, bye and bye
There's a better home awaiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky"
The Carter Family,Wildwood Flower,"[Verse 1]
Oh, I'll twine with my mingles and waving black hair
With the roses so red and the lilies so fair
And the myrtle so bright with the emerald dew
The pale amanita and eyes look like blue

[Verse 2]
I will dance, I will sing, and my loft shall be gay
I will charm every heart, in his crown I will sway
When I woke from my dreaming my idol was clay
All portion of love had all flown away

[Verse 3]
Oh, he taught me to love him and promised to love
And to cherish me over all others above
How my heart is now wondering no misery can tell
He's left me no warning, no words of farewell

[Verse 4]
Oh, he taught me to love him and called me his flower
That's blooming to cheer him through life's dreary hour
Oh, I long to see him and regret the dark hour
He's gone and neglected this pale wildwood flower"
The Carter Family,Keep on the Sunny Side,"[Verse 1]
There's a dark and a troubled side of life
There's a bright and a sunny side, too
Though we meet with the darkness and strife
The sunny side we also may view

[Chorus]
Keep on the sunny side, always on the sunny side
Keep on the sunny side of life
It will help us every day, it will brighten all the way
If we'll keep on the sunny side of life

[Verse 2]
The storm and its fury broke today
Crushing hopes that we cherished so dear
Clouds and storm will in time pass away
The sun again will shine bright and clear

[Chorus]
Keep on the sunny side, always on the sunny side
Keep on the sunny side of life
It will help us every day, it will brighten all the way
If we'll keep on the sunny side of life

[Verse 3]
Let us greet with a song of hope each day
Though the moment be cloudy or fair
Let us trust in our Savior always
To keep us every one in His care

[Chorus]
Keep on the sunny side, always on the sunny side
Keep on the sunny side of life
It will help us every day, it will brighten all the way
If we'll keep on the sunny side of life"
The Carter Family,Can’t Feel at Home,"[Verse 1]
This world is not my home, I'm just a-passing through
My treasures and my hopes are all beyond the blue;
Where many Christian children have gone on before
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore
Over in glory land there is no dying there
The saints are shouting Victory and singing everywhere
I hear the voice of Nell that I have heard before
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore

[Chorus]
Oh Lord, You know I have no friend like you
If Heaven's not my home, Oh Lord what would I do?
Angels taken me to Heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore

[Verse 2]
Heaven's expecting me that's one thing I know
I fixed it up with Jesus a long time ago
He will take me through though I am weak and poor
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore
Oh I have a loving mother over in glory land
I don't expect to stop until I shake her hand
She's gone on before just waiting at heaven's door
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore

[Chorus]"
The Carter Family,Bury Me Under the Weeping Willow Tree,"[Verse 1]
My heart is sad, and I'm in sorrow
For the only one I love
When shall I see him, oh, no, never
Till I meet him in heaven above

[Chorus]
Oh, bury me under the weeping willow
Yes, under the weeping willow tree
So he may know where I am sleeping
And perhaps he will weep for me

[Verse 2]
They told me that he did not love me
I could not believe it was true
Until an angel softly whispered
""He has proven untrue to you""

[Chorus]
Oh, bury me under the weeping willow
Yes, under the weeping willow tree
So he may know where I am sleeping
And perhaps he will weep for me

[Verse 3]
Tomorrow was our wedding day
But, Oh Lord, where is he?
He's gone to seek him another bride
And he cares no more for me

[Chorus]
Oh, bury me under the weeping willow
Yes, under the weeping willow tree
So he may know where I am sleeping
And perhaps he will weep for me

[Verse 4]
Oh, bury me under the violets blue
To prove my love to him
Tell him that I would die to save him
For his love I never could win

Oh, bury me under the weeping willow
Yes, under the weeping willow tree
So he may know where I am sleeping
And perhaps he will weep for me"
The Carter Family,When the World’s on Fire,"Oh, my loving mother, when the world's on fire
Don't you want God's bosom to be your pillow

And I want God's bosom to be my pillow
Tide me over in the Rock of Ages
Rock of Ages cleft for me

Tide me over in the Rock of Ages
Rock of Ages cleft for me"

The Carter Family,I Never Will Marry,"[Verse 1]
One morning as I rambled all down the seashore
The wind it did whistle and the waters did roar
I heard a fair damsel make a pitiful sound
It sounded so lonesome in the waters around

[Chorus]
I never will marry or be no man's wife
I expect to live single all the days of my life
The shells in the ocean shall be my deathbed
The fish in deep water swim over my head

She plunged her fair body in the water so deep
She closed her blue eyes in the waters to sleep
My love's gone and left me, the one I adore
She's gone where I never will see her anymore

I expect to live single all the days of my life
The shells in the ocean shall be my deathbed
The fish in deep water swim over my head"

Built for Jesus on high, there we never shall die
This is a land where we'll never grow old

Never grow old, (where we'll) never grow old
In the land where we'll never grow old
Never grow old, (where we'll) never grow old
In the land where we'll never grow old

In that beautiful home, where we'll nevermore roam
We shall be in the sweet by and by
Happy praise to the king, through eternity sing
Is a land where we never shall die

When our work here is done, and the life's crown is won
And our troubles and trials are o'er
All our sorrow will end, and our voices will blend
With the loved ones who've gone on before

The Carter Family,Worried Man Blues,"CHORUS
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
I'm worried now
But I won't be worried long

I went across the river, I lay down to sleep
I went across the river, I lay down to sleep
When I woke up
Had shackles on my feet

Twenty-nine links of chain around my leg
Twenty-nine links of chain around my leg
And on each leg
The initials of my name

CHORUS

I asked the judge, what might be my fine?
I asked the judge, what might be my fine?
Twenty-one years
On the Rocky Mountain Line

The train I ride, sixteen coaches long
The train I ride, sixteen coaches long
The girl I love
Is on that train and gone

If anyone asks you who composed this song
If anyone asks you who composed this song
Tell 'em was I
And I sing it all day long

The Carter Family,Give Me Roses While I Live,"[Verse 1]
Wonderful things of folks are said
When they have passed away
Roses adorn their narrow bed
Over the sleeping clay

Give me the roses while I live
Trying to cheer me on
Useless are flowers that you give
After the soul has gone

Let us not wait to do good deeds
Till they have passed away
Now is the time to sow good seeds
While here on earth we stay

Now should the words be said

The Carter Family,No Depression In Heaven,"For fear the hearts of men are failing
For these are latter days we know
The Great Depression now is spreading
God's word declared it would be so

I'm going where there's no depression
To the lovely land that's free from care
I'll leave this world of toil and trouble
My home's in Heaven, I'm going there

In that bright land, there'll be no hunger
No orphan children crying for bread
No weeping widows, toil or struggle
No shrouds, no coffins and no death

I'm going where there's no depression
To the lovely land that's free from care
I'll leave this world of toil and trouble
My home's in Heaven, I'm going there

This dark hour of midnight nearing
Tribulation time will come
This storm will hurl in midnight fear
And sweep lost millions to their doom

I'm going where there's no depression
To the lovely land that's free from care
I'll leave this world of toil and trouble
My home's in Heaven, I'm going there"

How will it be with my poor soul
Where shall I be

Oh, where shall I be
When the first trumpet sounds
Oh, where shall I be
When it sounds so loud
When it sounds so loud as to wake up the dead
Oh, where shall I be when it sounds

Where shall I be
And to the rocks and mountains flee
Where shall I be
When hills and mountains flee away
Where shall I be
And all the work of men decay
Where shall I be

When the savior reigns from shore to shore
Where shall I be
From God's angry presence thrown
Where shall I be

I'll be sleeping in my grave
When it sounds so loud
When it sounds so loud as to wake up the dead

Oh come, come, come, come
Come to the church in the wildwood
Oh come to the church in the dale

The Carter Family,Diamonds in the Rough,"[Verse 1]
While walking out one evening, not knowing where to go
Just to pass the time away before we held our show
I heard the Bethel Nation stand, singing with all their might
I give my heart to Jesus and left the show that night

[Chorus]
The day will soon be over and digging will be done
And no more gems be gathered, so let us all press on
When Jesus comes to claim us and says it is enough
The diamonds will be shining, no longer in the rough

[Verse 2]
One day, my precious comrade, you, too, were lost in sin
And others sought your rescue and Jesus took you in
And when you're tired and tempted and scoffers can rebuff
Don't turn away in anger this diamond in the rough

[Chorus]
The day will soon be over and digging will be done
And no more gems be gathered, so let us all press on
When Jesus comes to claim us and says it is enough
The diamonds will be shining, no longer in the rough

[Verse 3]
While reading through the Bible, some wondrous sights I see
I read of Peter, James, and John on the Sea of Galilee
And Jesus when he found them he bound them very tough
And they were precious diamonds he gathered in the rough

The day will soon be over and digging will be done
And no more gems be gathered, so let us all press on
When Jesus comes to claim us and says it is enough
The diamonds will be shining, no longer in the rough"

Who is sailing far over the sea
Oh, I'm thinking tonight of my blue eyes
And I wonder if he ever thinks of me

Oh, you told me once, dear, that you loved me
You said that we never would part
But a link in the chain has been broken
Leaves me with a sad and aching heart

Will you come, dear, and shed just one tear
And say to the strangers around you
A poor heart you have broken lies here

But I'll return to you some time
If I go 10,000 miles

The storms are on the ocean
The heavens may cease to be
This world may lose its motion, love
If I prove false to thee

Oh, who will dress your pretty little feet
Oh, who will glove your hand
Who will kiss your rosy red cheeks
When I'm in the far off land

The storms are on the ocean
The heavens may cease to be
This world may lose its motion, love
If I prove false to thee

Oh, papa will dress my pretty little feet
And mama will glove my hand
You can kiss my rosy red cheeks
When you return again

The storms are on the ocean
The heavens may cease to be
This world may lose its motion, love
If I prove false to thee

Oh, have you seen those lonesome doves
Flying from pine to pine
A-mourning for their own true loves
Just like I mourn for mine

The storms are on the ocean
The heavens may cease to be
This world may lose its motion, love
If I prove false to thee

I'll never go back on the ocean, love
I'll never go back on the sea
I'll never go back on the blue-eyed girl
Till she goes back on me

All my joys with you I'll share
I'm going to take a trip in that old gospel ship
And go sailing through the air

I can scarcely wait, I know I won't be late
I'll spend my time in prayer
And when the ship comes in, I'll leave this world of sin
And go sailing through the air

If you are ashamed of me, you ought not to be
Yes, you'd better have a care
If too much fault you find, you will sure be left behind
While I'm sailing through the air"
The Carter Family,The Winding Stream,"[Verse 1]
O give to me a winding stream
It must not be too wide
Where waving leaves from maple trees
Do meet from either side
The water must be deep enough
To float a small canoe
With no one else but you

[Chorus]
Do not disturb
My waking dream
The splendour of
That winding stream
Flower in my canoe
Her eyes they look me through
A maiden fair with golden hair
Is very much like you

[Verse 2]
The sparkling trout beneath the bank
Does leave his hiding place
Kingfisher from the bough above
So eager to give chase
The spreading branches overhead
The sunrise peeping through
When looking, dear, at you

[Chorus]"
The Carter Family,Wabash Cannonball,"[Verse 1]
Out from the wide Pacific to the broad Atlantic shore
She climbs flowery mountains, over hills and by the shore
Although she's tall and handsome and she's known quite well by all
She's a regular combination of the Wabash Cannonball
Oh, the eastern states are dandy, so the western people say
Chicago, Rock Island, St. Louis by the way
To the lakes of Minnesota, where the rippling waters fall
No changes to be taken on the Wabash Cannonball

[Chorus]
Oh, listen to the jingle, the rumour and the roar
As she glides along the woodlands, over hills and by the shore
She climbs the flowery mountains, hear the merrier hobo squall
She glides along the woodlands, the Wabash Cannonball

[Verse 2]
Oh, here's old Daddy Cleton, let his name forever be
And long be remembered in the courts of Tennessee
For he is a good old rounder, till the curtain round him fall
He'll be carried back to victory on the Wabash Cannonball
I have rode the I.C. Limited, also the Royal Blue
Across the eastern countries, on mail car number two
I have rode those high ball trains from coast to coast, that's all
But I have found no equal to the Wabash Cannonball

[Chorus]"
The Carter Family,We Will March Through the Streets of the City,"[Chorus]
We will march through the streets of the city
With our loved ones (that's) gone before
We will sit on the banks of the river
Where we'll meet to part no more

[Verse 1]
Jesus sought me when a stranger
Wandering from the fold of God
He to rescue me from danger
And transported by his blood
Come, thy fount of every blessing
Do now hark to sing God's praise
Streams of mercy never ceasing
Calls for songs of loudest praise

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Hark the voice of Jesus calling
Who will go and work today
Fields are white and harvest is waiting
Who will bear the sheaves away

[Chorus]"
The Carter Family,Anchored in Love,"[Verse 1]
I found a sweet haven of sunshine at last
In Jesus abiding above
His dear arms around me are lovingly cast
And sweetly he tells his love

[Chorus]
The tempest is o'er
(The dangerous tempest forever is o'er)
I'm safe evermore
(My anchor is holding, I'm safe evermore)
What gladness, what rapture is mine
(What gladness, what rapture is mine)
The danger is past
(The waters are peaceful, the danger is past)
I'm anchored at last
(My spirit is happy, I'm anchored at last)
I'm anchored in love divine
(I'm anchored in love divine)

[Verse 2]
He saw me endangered and lovingly came
To pilot my stormy doomed soul
Sweet peace he has spoken and bless his dear name
The billows no longer roll

[Chorus]
The tempest is o'er
(The dangerous tempest forever is o'er)
I'm safe evermore
(My anchor is holding, I'm safe evermore)
What gladness, what rapture is mine
(What gladness, what rapture is mine)
The danger is past
(The waters are peaceful, the danger is past)
I'm anchored at last
(My spirit is happy, I'm anchored at last)
I'm anchored in love divine
(I'm anchored in love divine)

[Verse 3]
His love shall enfold me through life and in death
Completely I'll trust to the end
I'll praise him each hour and my last fleeting breath
Shall sing of my soul's best friend

[Chorus]
The tempest is o'er
(The dangerous tempest forever is o'er)
I'm safe evermore
(My anchor is holding, I'm safe evermore)
What gladness, what rapture is mine
(What gladness, what rapture is mine)
The danger is past
(The waters are peaceful, the danger is past)
I'm anchored at last
(My spirit is happy, I'm anchored at last)
I'm anchored in love divine
(I'm anchored in love divine)"
Randy Travis,Three Wooden Crosses,"[Verse 1]
A farmer and a teacher, a hooker and a preacher
Riding on a midnight bus bound for Mexico
One was headed for vacation, one for higher education
And two of them were searching for lost souls
That driver never ever saw the stop sign
And eighteen wheelers can't stop on a dime

[Chorus]
There are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway
Why there's not four of them, Heaven only knows
I guess it's not what you take when you leave this world behind you
It's what you leave behind you when you go

[Verse 2]
That farmer left a harvest, a home, and eighty acres
The faith and love for growing things in his young son's heart
And that teacher left her wisdom in the minds of lots of children
And did her best to give 'em all a better start
And that preacher whispered, ""Can't you see the Promised Land?""
As he laid his blood-stained Bible in that hooker's hand

[Chorus]
There are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway
Why there's not four of them, Heaven only knows
I guess it's not what you take when you leave this world behind you
It's what you leave behind you when you go

[Bridge]
That's the story that our preacher told last Sunday
As he held that blood-stained Bible up for all of us to see
He said, ""Bless the farmer, and the teacher, and the preacher
Who gave this Bible to my mama, who read it to me""

[Chorus]
There are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway
Why there's not four of them, now I guess we know
It's not what you take when you leave this world behind you
It's what you leave behind you when you go

[Outro]
There are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway"
Randy Travis,I Told You So,"[Verse 1]
Suppose I called you up tonight and told you that I love you
And suppose I said I want to come back home
And suppose I cried and said I think I've finally learned my lesson
And I'm tired of spendin' all my time alone

[Verse 2]
If I told you that I realized you're all I ever wanted
And it's killin' me to be so far away
Would you tell me that you love me too and would we cry together?
Or would you simply laugh at me and say

[Chorus]
I told you so, oh, I told you so
I told you someday you'd come crawlin' back and askin' me to take you in
I told you so, but you had to go
But now I've found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again

[Verse 3]
If I got down on my knees and told you I was yours forever
Would you get down on yours too and take my hand?
Would we get that old-time feelin'? Would we laugh and talk for hours?
The way we did when our love first began

[Verse 4]
Would you tell me that you've missed me too and that you've been so lonely
And you've waited for the day that I returned
And we'd live and love forever, and that I'm your one and only
Or would you say the tables finally turned?

[Chorus]
Would you say I told you so, oh, I told you so
I told you someday you'd come crawlin' back and asking me to take you in
I told you so, but you had to go
And now I've found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again

[Outro]
And now I've found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again"
Randy Travis,Where That Came From,"[Verse 1]
She had eyes like diamonds and they caught the light
Oh, but they were dark and deeper than the night

[Chorus]
But when she'd smile, out came the sun
And there ain't no more where that came from

[Verse 2]
She had a dress that swayed all around her knees
And a voice as soft as a summer breeze

[Chorus]
A touch that told me I was the one
And there ain't no more where that came from

[Bridge]
I must have said to myself, there might be somebody else
Out there, somewhere
I must have said to myself, it's a great big world
Girls are everywhere

[Chorus]
Oh, but now I know, there was only one
And there ain't no more where that came from
And it ain't like I ain't been trying to find someone
There just ain't no more where that came from

[Outro]
Oh, where that came from"
Randy Travis,Deeper Than the Holler,"Well I've heard those city singers singin' 'bout how they can love,
Deeper than the oceans, higher than the stars above.
Well, I come from the country, and I know I ain't seen it all
But I heard that ocean's salty, and the stars, they sometimes fall.
And that would not do justice to the way I feel for you
So I had to sing this song about all the things I knew

My love is deeper than the holler.
Stronger than the river
Higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill
My love is purer than the snowflakes,
That fall in late December
And honest as a Robin on a springtime window sill
And longer than the song of a whippoorwill.

From the back roads to the Broadway shows with a million miles between
There's a least a million love songs that people love to sing
And every one is different, and every one's the same
And this is just another way of sayin' the same thing

My love is deeper than the holler
Stronger than the river
Higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill
My love is purer than the snowflakes
That fall in late December
And honest as a Robin on a spring-time window sill
And longer than the song of a whippoorwill

My love is deeper than the holler
Stronger than the river
Higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill
My love is purer than the snowflakes
That fall in late December
And honest as a Robin on a spring-time window sill
And longer than the song of a whippoorwill
A Whippoorwill"
Randy Travis,"Forever and Ever, Amen (2011)","You may think that I'm talking foolish

Make people forget things they knew

Randy Travis,Peace in the Valley,"[Verse 1]
Well, I'm tired and so weary, but I must go along
'Til the Lord comes and calls me away
Where the morning's so bright and the Lamb is the light
And the night, night is as fair as the day

There will be peace in the valley for me some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh, Lord, I pray

Randy Travis,On the Other Hand,"[Verse 1]
On one hand, I count the reasons I could stay with you
And hold you close to me all night long
So many lover's games, I'd love to play with you
On that hand, there's no reason why it's wrong

[Chorus]
But on the other hand, there's a golden band
To remind me of someone who would not understand
On one hand, I could stay and be your lovin' man
But the reason I must go is on the other hand

[Verse 2]
In your arms, I feel the passions I thought had died
When I looked into your eyes, I found myself
And when I first kissed your lips, I felt so alive
I've got to hand it to you girl, you're somethin' else

[Chorus]
But on the other hand, there's a golden band
To remind me of someone who would not understand
On one hand, I could stay and be your lovin' man
But the reason I must go is on the other hand
Yeah, the reason I must go is on the other hand"
Randy Travis,The Simple Things,"You can offer me a diamond-plated pearl;
You can send me all the riches in the world;
You can tempt me with the palaces of kings;
I'd give 'em back in a big ol' sack and keep the simple things

I've got the simple things; I've got the rain in spring
Got spicy chicken wings, and French-fried onion rings

You can line me up a mile of limousines;
For me it don't add up to a hill o' beans;
I got no hankerin' for grabbin' your brass ring;
It's crystal clear - I'll stay right here and keep the simple things

I've got the summer breeze, got 16 cans of peas
A two-speed window fan when it's 93 degrees
So forgive me for not grabbin' your brass ring;
It's crystal clear - I'll stay right here and keep the simple things
It's crystal clear - I'll stay right here and keep the simple things"
Randy Travis,Diggin’ Up Bones,"[Verse 1]
Last night, I dug your picture out from my old dresser drawer
I set it on the table and I talked to it 'til four
I read some old love letters right up 'til the break of dawn
Yeah, I've been sittin' alone, diggin' up bones

[Verse 2]
Then I went through the jewelry and I found our wedding rings
I put mine on my finger and I gave yours a fling
Across this lonely bedroom of our recent broken home
Yeah, tonight, I'm sittin' alone, diggin' up bones

[Chorus]
I'm diggin' up bones (Diggin' up bones)
I'm diggin' up bones (Diggin' up bones)
Exhumin' things that's better left alone
I'm resurrectin' memories of a love that's dead and gone
Yeah, tonight, I'm sittin' alone, diggin' up bones

[Verse 3]
And I went through the closet and I found some things in there
Like that pretty negligee that I bought you to wear
And I recall how good you looked each time you had it on
Yeah, tonight, I'm sittin' alone, diggin' up bones

I'm diggin' up bones (Diggin' up bones)

Randy Travis,Cowboy Boogie,"[Verse 1]
When he swings in the saddle, he's a real gone cat
With his Spanish spurs and his buckaroo hat
Camps in an old line shack way back in the sticks
He loves to tie 'em down and burn their hide
And there ain't no rough string he can't ride
But cuttin' a rug is how he gets his kicks

[Chorus]
He does the cowboy boogie
The cowboy way
The cowboy boogie
Come ah ty yah yippy yippy yah yippy yippy yay

[Verse 2]
So it's adios to his old payoose
And down the road to turn it loose
At an old dance hall he cuts that gal out straight
Spins her sideways through the herd
He's bucking like he's being spurred
Twisting and a rocking like a bronc
Coming outta the gate

[Chorus]
He does the cowboy boogie
The cowboy way
The cowboy boogie
Come ah ty yah yippy yippy yah yippy yippy yay

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Well he swings in the saddle, he's a real gone cat
With his Spanish spurs and his buckaroo hat
A true ? walking fool, he ain't no dude
The Fred Astaire of hill and range
Two parts cool and one part strange
He's the best out west at any altitude

[Chorus]
He does the cowboy boogie
The cowboy way
The cowboy boogie
Come ah ty yah yippy yippy yah yippy yippy yay

[Chorus]
He does the cowboy boogie
The cowboy way
The cowboy boogie
Come ah ty yah yippy yippy yah yah yippy
Come ah ty yah yippy yippy yah yah yippy
Come ah ty yah yippy yippy yah yah yippy yippy yay"
Randy Travis,He Walked on Water,"[Intro]
He wore starched white shirts buttoned at the neck
And he'd sit in the shade and watch the chickens peck
And his teeth were gone, but what the heck
I thought, that he walked, on water

[Verse 1]
He said he was a cowboy, when he was young
He could handle a rope, and he was good with a gun
And my mama's daddy was his oldest son
And I thought, that he walked, on water

[Chorus]
And if the story was told, only heaven knows
But his hat seemed to me, like an old halo
And although his wings, they were never seen
I thought, that he walked, on water

[Verse 2]
Then he tied a cord, to the end of a mop
And said, ""son, here's a pony, keep her at a trot""
And I'd ride in circles while he laughed a lot
Then I'd flop down beside him

[Bridge]
And he was ninety years old in '63
And I loved him and he loved me
And lord, I cried the day he died
'Cause I thought, that he walked, on water

[Chorus]
And if the story was told, only heaven knows
But his hat seemed to me, like an old halo
And though his wings, they were never seen
I thought, that he walked, on water

[Outro]
Yeah, I thought that he walked, on water"
Randy Travis,Better Class Of Losers,"[Verse 1]
I'm gettin' out of this high-rise penthouse suite
Where we pretend life's rosy and sweet
I'm going back to the folks that I used to know
Where everyone is what they seem to be

[Verse 2]
And these high class friends that you like to hang around
When they look my way, they're always looking down
And I'm tired of you spending every dime I make
To finance this way of life I've learned to hate

[Chorus]
I'm going back to a better class of losers
This uptown living's really got me down
I need friends who don't pay their bills on home computers
And they buy their coffee beans already ground
You think it's disgraceful that they drink three dollar wine
But a better class of loser suits me fine

[Verse 3]
You said the grass was greener on the other side
But from where I stand, I can't see grass at all
And the concrete and the steel won't change the way you feel
And it takes more than caviar to have a ball

[Chorus]
I'm going back to a better class of losers
This uptown living's really got me down
I need friends who don't pay their bills on home computers
And they buy their coffee beans already ground
You think it's disgraceful that they drink three dollar wine
But a better class of loser suits me fine

[Outro]
Yes, a better class of loser just suits me fine"
Randy Travis,Are You Washed in the Blood?,"[Verse 1]
Have you been to Jesus for the cleansing power?
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?
Are you fully trusting in His grace this hour?
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?

[Chorus]
Are you washed (Are you washed) in the blood? (In the blood)
In the soul-cleansing blood of the Lamb?
Are your garments spotless, are they white as snow?
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?

[Verse 2]
Are you walking daily by the Saviors side?
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?
Do you rest each moment in the crucified?
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?

[Chorus]
Are you washed (Are you washed) in the blood? (In the blood)
In the soul-cleansing blood of the Lamb?
Are your garments spotless, are they white as snow?
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Are you washed (Are you washed) in the blood? (In the blood)
In the soul-cleansing blood of the Lamb?

Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?

Are your garments spotless, are they white as snow?
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?"

Randy Travis,If I Didn’t Have You,"[Verse 1]
Well, I lost my heart on the day we met
But I gained a lot and that I don't regret
Then I hung around 'til you said I do
I knew I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you

[Verse 2]
Well, it changed my thinkin' when you changed your name
And neither one of us will ever be the same
And I swear I'm never gonna be untrue
'Cause I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you

[Chorus]
If I didn't have you, I'd long ago
Been left in the dark, out in the cold
Blowin' around from town to town
Like a feather in the wind
If I didn't have you, I know I'd be
Flounderin' around like a ship at sea
Lost in the rain of a hurricane
And that's where I'd have been

[Post-Chorus]
But I didn't get lost 'cause I saw your light
Shinin' like a beacon on a cold dark night
And the sun came up and the skies turned blue
No, I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you

[Verse 3]
Well, I count my blessings every night I pray
That the Lord lets me keep you just one more day
And every day He does, 'cause God knows too
That I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you

[Chorus]
If I didn't have you, I'd long ago
Been left in the dark out in the cold
Blowin' around from town to town

If I didn't have you, I know I'd be
Flounderin' around like a ship at sea
Lost in the rain of a hurricane
And that's where I'd have been

Shinin' like a beacon on cold dark night

I know I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you"
Randy Travis,Pray For The Fish,"[Verse 1]
Everybody gathered where the river runs wider
At the edge of town
To see if that Eddy Lee Vaughn baptism
Was really gonna go down
Folks bet their hard earned money that water wouldn't change a thing
They set the odds at a hundred to one his soul would never come clean

[Pre-Chorus]
Then the preacher said, ""People take a moment or two
There's something we need to do""

[Chorus]
Pray for the fish
They won't know what's comin'
When the sin starts rolling off the likes of him
Lord, be with 'em, they ain't done nothin'
Please, won't you leave 'em just a little bit of room to swim
Pray for the fish

[Verse 2]
Well, the preacher ducked him under that cool clear water
Then he did it again
Eddy came up yellin', ""Lord in Heaven
Hallelujah, I'm a brand new man""
Well, the water got to bubblin', sky got to rumblin'
And the thunder backed up the choir
The fish started jumpin'
It was like they was swimmin' in a lake of fire

[Pre-Chorus]
Then Eddy's mama stepped out of the crowd
And started yellin' out loud

[Chorus]
Pray for the fish
They won't know what's comin'
When the sin starts rollin' off the likes of him
Lord, be with 'em, they ain't done nothin'
Please, won't you leave 'em just a little bit of room to swim
Pray for the fish

[Bridge]
He said, ""Everybody cross your fingers, fold your hands
Pray for old Eddy but before we say Amen
Pray for the fish

[Chorus]
Lord, be with 'em, they ain't done nothin'
Please, won't you leave 'em just a little bit of room to swim
Pray for the fish

[Outro]
Lord, pray for the fish"
Randy Travis,"Look Heart, No Hands","I remember how it used to feel
Riding down old two mile hill
Tennis shoes up on the handle bars
Paying no mind to the passing cars
No doubts, no fears, just like when you are here

No chains, no strings, no fences, no walls
No net, just you to catch me when I fall
Look heart, no hands

It took a little time to get up to speed
To find the confidence and strength I'd need
To just let go and reach for the sky
You know sometimes it felt I could fly
No doubts, no fears, just like when you are here

No chains, no strings, no fences, no walls
No net, just you to catch me when I fall
Look heart, no hands

It doesn't take much
Just a smile or a touch
And I'm a kid again
I can almost feel that wind

No chains, no strings, no fences, no walls
No net, just you to catch me when I fall
Look heart, no hands
Look heart, no hands"
Randy Travis,It’s Just a Matter of Time,"[Verse 1]
Someday, someway
You'll realize that you've been blind
Yes, darlin', you're gonna need me again
It's just a matter of time

[Verse 2]
Go on, go on
'Til you've reached the end of the line
'Cause I know, you'll pass my way again
It's just a matter of time

[Chorus]
After I gave you, everything I had
You laughed and called me a clown
Remember, in your search, for fortune and fame
What goes up, must come down

[Verse 3]
I... I know, I know
That one day you'll wake up and find
That my love is a true love
It's just a matter of time

[Bridge]
Someday, in some way
Girl, you'll realize that you've been blind
Yes, darlin', I know you're gonna need me again
It's just a matter of time

After I gave you everything I had
You laughed and you called me a clown
But remember, in your search, for fortune and fame
What goes up, must come down

I... I know, I know
That one day you'll wake up and find
That my love was a true love
It's just a matter of time"
Randy Travis,Just A Closer Walk With Thee,"[Verse 1]
I am weak, but Thou art strong
Jesus, keep me from all wrong
I'll be satisfied as long as I walk
Dear Lord, close to Thee

[Chorus]
Just a closer walk with Thee
Grant it, Jesus, is my plea
Daily walkin' close to Thee
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be

Through this world of toils and snares
If I falter, Lord, who cares?
Who with me my burden shares?
None but Thee, dear Lord, none but Thee

Just a closer walk with Thee
Grant it, Jesus, is my plea
Daily walkin' close to Thee

When my feeble life is o'er
And time for me will be no more
Guide me gently, safely o'er
To Thy kingdom, dear Lord, to Thy shore

[Chorus]
Just a closer walk with Thee
Grant it, Jesus, is my plea
Daily walkin' close to Thee
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be"
Randy Travis,More Life,"(Verse)
He stares into the mirror
At the shell of a man he once was
At the hard evidence
Of what living for a dollar one day does
He thinks about the things he's gonna change
As soon as he gets back up to speed
Then the nurse comes in with something for the pain
And says ""Is there anything more you need?""

(Chorus)
He says ""Yeah""
More life
More time
More faith
And the presence of mind to breath deeper
Love stronger
Stay the moment, one moment longer
Less anger
Less worries
Born alive

(Verse)
He says
I've been a mover and a shaker,buddy
Second to none
With the will of steel
Like a closing deal
You bet your life I got it done
Lately I think about the ones I might have hurt
And how easily I've easen in their way
What did I think it all was worth
Cause there's nothing I would not trade

(Chorus)
For
More life
More time
More faith
And a presence of mind to deep breathe deeper
Love stronger
Stay in the moment,one moment longer
Less anger
Less worry

(Bridge)
There is a woman who has loved me faithfully
And children I can't believe are grown
God knows why only now I see
They are the one true happiness I know

Breathe deeper
Love stronger
Stay in the moment, one moment longer
More love
More light
More light"

Randy Travis,Angels,"Me and some of the boys were sitting around the other night
Started talking about politics, religion, love and life
And what a shame it was about 9/11
And what about hell and what about heaven
And is there or isn't there angels on earth
And then one guy said
Well you can take that for what it's worth
If it's something I can see or something I can touch
Well I might believe in all that stuff
So I just had to say to him
Are you telling me you've never seen an angel?
Never felt the presence of one standing by
No robe of white, no halo in site
Well you missed the most obvious thing
Man, are you blind? Just look in your mothers eyes
And then I said ""Who went through the pain
And smiled through the tears on the day of your birth?""
She counted your fingers and toes and thank God you were whole
Son you outta know who loved you first, that's right
And who always came running every time you cried out
And how many more things have you forgotten about
And who tried their best to teach you wrong from right
And how many nights did she leave on the light
While she waited and prayed that you came in
And who'd be there for you right up to the end think about it tonight
Are you telling me that you've never seen an angel?
Never felt the presence of one standing by
No robe of white, no halo in sight
Well you missed the most obvious thing
Ah man, are you blind? Just look in your mothers eyes
Ah man, are you blind? Just look in your mothers eyes, well that's right"
Randy Travis,1982,"[Verse 1]
Operator, please connect me with 1982
I need to make apologies for what I didn't do
I sure do need to tell her that I've thought the whole thing through
And now it's clear that she is what I should have held onto

[Chorus]
They say hindsight's 20/20, but I'm nearly goin' blind
From starin' at her photograph and wishing she was mine
It's that same ol' lost love story, it's sad but it's true
There was a time when she was mine in 1982

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Postman, can you sell me a special kind of stamp
One to send a letter from this crazy lonely man
Back into the wasted years of my living past
I need to tell her now I know how long my love will last

[Chorus]
They say hindsight's 20/20, but I'm nearly goin' blind
From starin' at her photograph and wishing she was mine
It's that same ol' lost love story, it's sad but it's true
There was a time when she was mine in 1982

[Tag]
Losing my mind goin' back in time to 1982"
Randy Travis,Point of Light,"[Verse 1]
There is a point when you cannot walk away
When you have to stand up straight and tall and mean the word you say
There is a point you must decide just to do it 'cause it's right
That's when you become a point of light

[Verse 2]
There is a darkness that everyone must face
It wants to take what's good and fair and lay it all to waste
And that darkness covers everything in sight
Until it meets a single point of light

[Chorus]
All it takes is a point of light
A ray of hope in the darkest night
If you see what's wrong and you try to make it right
You will be a point of light

[Verse 3]
There are heroes whose names we never hear
A dedicated army of quiet volunteers
Reaching out to feed the hungry, reaching out to save the land
Reaching out to help their fellow man

[Verse 4]
There are dreamers who are making dreams come true
Taking time to to teach the children, there's nothing they can't do
Giving shelter to the homeless, giving hope to those without
Isn't that what this land's all about?

[Bridge]
One by one, from the mountains to the sea
Points of light are calling out to you and me

[Chorus]
All it takes is a point of light
A ray of hope in the darkest night
If you see what's wrong and you try to make it right
You will be a point of light

[Refrain]
If you see what's wrong and you try to make it right
You will be a point of light"
Alabama,Dixieland Delight,"[Verse 1]
Rollin' down a backwoods Tennessee byway
One arm on the wheel
Holding my lover with the other
A sweet, soft, southern thrill
Worked hard all week, got a little jingle
On a Tennessee Saturday night
Couldn't feel better, I'm together
With my Dixieland Delight

[Chorus]
Spend my dollar, parked in a holler
'Neath the mountain moonlight
Hold her up tight
Make a little lovin'
A little turtle-dovin'
On a Mason-Dixon night
Fits my life, oh, so right
My Dixieland Delight

[Instrumental Bridge: 1:27 - 1:49]

[Verse 2]
White-tail buck deer, munching on clover
Red-tail hawk, sitting on a limb
Chubby old groundhog, croaking bullfrog
Free as the feeling in the wind
Home-grown country girl, gonna give me a whirl
On a Tennessee Saturday night
Lucky as a seven, livin' in heaven
With my Dixieland Delight

[Chorus]
Spend my dollar, parked in a holler
'Neath the mountain moonlight
Hold her up tight
Make a little lovin'
A little turtle-dovin'
On a Mason-Dixon night
Fits my life, oh, so right
My Dixieland Delight

[Instrumental Bridge: 3:11 - 3:43]

[Chorus]
Spend my dollar, parked in a holler
'Neath the mountain moonlight
Hold her up tight

A little turtle-dovin'
On a Mason-Dixon night
Fits my life, oh, so right
My Dixieland Delight

Rolling down a backwoods Tennessee byway

Holding my lover with the other

With my Dixieland Delight"
Alabama,Song of the South,"[Chorus]
Song, Song of the South
Sweet potato pie, and I shut my mouth
Gone, Gone with the Wind
There ain't nobody lookin' back again

Cotton on the roadside, cotton in the ditch
We all picked the cotton, but we never got rich
Daddy was a veteran, a Southern Democrat
They oughta get rich man to vote like that

But we were so poor that we couldn't tell
Cotton was short, and the weeds were tall
But Mr. Roosevelt a-gonna save us all
Well, momma got sick, and daddy got down
The county got the farm, and they moved to town
Poppa got a job with the TVA
We bought a washin' machine and then a Chevrolet

Sweet potato pie, and I shut my mouth
Gone, Gone with the Wind
There ain't nobody lookin' back again

Alabama,40 Hour Week (For A Livin’),"[Verse 1]
There are people in this country
Who work hard every day
But not for fame or fortune do they strive
But the fruits of their labor
Are worth more than their pay
And it's time a few of them were recognized

[Pre-Chorus]
Hello Detroit auto workers
Let me thank you for your time
You work a 40 hour week for a livin'
Just to send it on down the line
Hello Pittsburgh steel mill worker
Let me thank you for your time
You work a 40 hour week for a livin'
Just to send it on down the line

[Chorus]
This is for the one who swings the hammer
Driving home the nail
Or the one behind the counter
Ringing up the sale
Or the one who fights the fires
The one who brings the mail
For everyone who works behind the scenes

[Verse 2]
You can see them every morning
In the factories and the fields
In the city streets and the quiet country towns
Working together like spokes inside a wheel
They keep this country turning around

[Pre-Chorus]
Hello Kansas wheat field farmer
Let me thank you for your time
You work a 40 hour week for a livin'
Just to send it on down the line
Hello West Virginia coal miner
Let me thank you for your time
You work a 40 hour week for a livin'
Just to send it on down the line

[Chorus]
This is for the one who drives the big rig
Up and down the road
Or the one out in the warehouse
Bringing in the load
Or the waitress, the mechanic
The policeman on patrol
For everyone who works behind the scenes
With a spirit you can't replace with no machine

[Outro]
Hello America, let me thank you for your time"
Alabama,Mountain Music,"[Intro]
You see that mountain over there? Yeah?
Well, one of these days I'm going to climb that mountain

[Chorus]
Oh, play me some mountain music
Like grandma and grandpa used to play
Then I'll float on down the river
To a Cajun hideaway

[Verse]
Drift away like Tom Sawyer, ride a raft with old Huck Finn
Take a nap like Rip Van Winkle, daze dreaming again

[Chorus]
Oh, play me some mountain music
Like grandma and grandpa used to play
Then I'll float on down the river
To a Cajun hideaway

[Verse 2]
Swim across the river, just to prove that I'm a man
Spend the day being lazy, just being nature's friend
Climb a long tall hickory. Bend it over, skinning cats
Playing baseball with chert rocks, using sawmill slabs for bats

[Bridge]
Play some back-home, come-on music
That comes from the heart
Play something with lots of feeling
Because that's where music has to start

[Chorus]
Oh, play me some mountain music
Like grandma and grandpa used to play
Then I'll float on down the river
To a Cajun hideaway

[Outro]
Oh play me mountain music
Oh play me mountain music
Oh play me mountain music
Oh play me mountain music"
Alabama,I’m In A Hurry (And Don’t Know Why),"[Chorus]

Oh, I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why

Don't know why
I have to drive so fast
My car has nothing to prove
It's not new
But it'll do 0 to 60 in 5.2, oh

I'm in a hurry to get things done
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why

Can't be late
I leave in plenty of time
Shaking hands with the clock
I can't stop
I'm on a roll and I'm ready to rock, oh

[Chorus]
I'm in a hurry to get things done
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why

I hear a voice
It says I'm running behind
I better pick up my pace
It's a race
And there ain't no room
For someone in second place

I'm in a hurry to get things done
I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why
I'm in a hurry to get things done
I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why
I'm in a hurry to get things done

Alabama,Old Flame,"[Verse 1]
I saw you staring at each other
I saw your eyes begin to glow
And I could tell you once were lovers
But you ain't hiding nothing that I don't know

[Chorus]
There's an old flame burning in your eyes
That tears can't drown and make-up can't disguise
Now that old flame might not be stronger
But it's been burning longer
Than any spark I might have started in your eyes

[Verse 2]
You said it ended when he left you
You say your love for me is strong
But those old memories still upset you
Well, I might be a memory before too long

Alabama,Angels Among Us,"[Verse 1]
I was walking home from school on a cold winter day
Took a shortcut through the woods and I lost my way
It was getting late and I was scared and alone
But then a kind old man took my hand, and led me home
Now mama couldn't see him oh but he was standing there
And I knew in my heart he was the answer to my prayers

[Chorus]
Oh, I believe there are angels among us
Sent down to us from somewhere up above
They come to you and me in our darkest hours
To show us how to live to teach us how to give
To guide us with the light of love

[Verse 2]
When life held troubled times and had me down on my knees
There's always been someone to come along and comfort me
A kind word from a stranger to lend a helping hand
A phone call from a friend just to say I understand
But ain't it kind of funny at the dark end of the road
That someone lights the way with just a single ray of hope

[Chorus]
Oh, I believe there are angels among us
Sent down to us from somewhere up above
They come to you and me in our darkest hours
To show us how to live to teach us how to give
To guide us with the light of love

[Bridge]
They wear so many faces show up in the strangest places
To grace us with their mercy in our time of need

[Chorus]
Oh, I believe there are angels among us
Sent down to us from somewhere up above
They come to you and me in our darkest hours
To show us how to live to teach us how to give
To guide us with the light of love
To guide us with the light of love"
Alabama,If You’re Gonna Play In Texas (You Gotta Have A Fiddle In The Band),"[Chorus]
If you're gonna play in Texas, you gotta have a fiddle in the band
That lead guitar is hot but not for ""Louisiana Man""
So rosin up that bow for ""Faded Love"" and let's all dance
If you're gonna play in Texas you gotta have a fiddle in the band

[Verse 1]
I remember down in Houston we were puttin' on a show
When a cowboy in the back stood up and yelled ""Cotton Eye Joe!""
He said, ""We love what you're doing, boys don't get us wrong
There's just something missing in your song""

[Chorus]
If you're gonna play in Texas, you gotta have a fiddle in the band
That lead guitar is hot but not for ""Louisiana Man""

If you're gonna play in Texas you gotta have a fiddle in the band

[Verse 2]
So we dusted off our boots and put our cowboy hats on straight
Them Texans raised the roof when Jeff opened up his case
You say y'all all want to two-step, say you wanna do-si-do
Well here's a fiddling song before we go

[Chorus]
If you're gonna play in Texas, you gotta have a fiddle in the band
That lead guitar is hot but not for ""Louisiana Man""
So rosin up that bow for ""Faded Love"" and let's all dance
If you're gonna play in Texas you gotta have a fiddle in the band

If you're gonna play in Texas, you gotta have a fiddle in the band

And in Atlanta, Georgia, there's peace on earth tonight

Christmas in Dixie, it's snowing in the pines
Merry Christmas from Dixie to everyone tonight

Alabama,His Eye Is On The Sparrow,"Why should I feel discouraged?
And why should the shadows come?
And why should my heart be lonely
And long for heaven and home?

When Jesus is my portion
My constant friend is He
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me

And I sing because I'm happy
I sing because I am free
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me

Let not your heart be troubled
His tender word I hear
And resting on His goodness
I lose my doubts and fears

Though by the path He leads us
But one step I may see
His eye is on the sparrows
And I know He watches me

And I sing because I'm happy
And I sing because I'm free
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me

His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me"

In the mountains where I call home
Lord, times were good there

Oh, Tennessee River and a mountain man
We get together anytime we can
Oh, Tennessee River and a mountain man
We play together in Mother Nature's band

[Verse 2]
This mountain king done left his throne
On the Tennessee River and his mountain home
But I'm going back, leaving today
For my homeland so far away
Driving to Dixie, wasting no time
Back to the good life I left behind
Going down to the river with my fishing line
Climb back up the mountain by supper time

Oh, Tennessee River and a mountain man
We get together anytime we can
Oh, Tennessee River and a mountain man
We play together in Mother Nature's band

[Verse 3]
Me and my woman's done made our plans
On the Tennessee River, walking hand in hand
Going to raise a family, Lord, settle down
Where peace and love can still be found

[Chorus]
Oh, Tennessee River and a mountain man
We get together anytime we can
Oh, Tennessee River and a mountain man
We play together in Mother Nature's band
Oh, Tennessee River and a mountain man
We get together anytime we can
Oh, Tennessee River and a mountain man
We play together in Mother Nature's band
Oh, Tennessee River and a mountain man
We get together anytime we can
Oh, Tennessee River and a mountain man
We play together in Mother Nature's band"
Alabama,Roll On (Eighteen Wheeler),"[Chorus]
Roll on highway, roll on along
Roll on daddy 'til you get back home
Roll on family, roll on crew
Roll on momma like I asked you to do
And roll on eighteen-wheeler, roll on (Roll on)

[Verse 1]
Well, it's Monday morning, he's kissing momma goodbye
He's up and gone with the sun
Daddy drives an eighteen-wheeler
And he's off on a midwest run
As three sad faces gather round momma
They ask her when daddy's coming home
Daddy drives an eighteen-wheeler
And they sure miss him when he's gone (Yeah, they do)

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah, but he calls them everynight
And he tells them that he loves them
He taught them this song to sing

[Chorus]
Roll on highway, roll on along
Roll on daddy 'til you get back home
Roll on family, roll on crew
Roll on momma like I asked you to do
And roll on eighteen-wheeler, roll on(Roll on)

[Verse 2]
Well, it's Wednesday evening, momma's waitin by the phone
It rings but it's not his voice
Seems the highway patrol has found a jackknifed rig
In a snow bank in Illinois
But the driver was missing
And the search had been abandoned
'Cause the weather had everything stalled
And they had checked all the houses and the local motels
When they had some more news they'd call

[Pre-Chorus]
And she told them when they found him
To tell him that she loved him
And she hung up the phone singing

[Chorus]
Roll on highway, roll on along
Roll on daddy 'til you get back home
Roll on family, roll on crew
Roll on momma like I asked you to do
And roll on eighteen-wheeler, roll on

[Verse 3]
Momma and the children will be waiting up all night long
Thinking nothing but the worst is coming
With the ringing of the telephone
Oh, but the man upstairs was listening
When momma asked him to bring daddy home
And when the call came in it was daddy on the other end
Asking her if she had been singing the song, singing

[Chorus]
Roll on highway, roll on along
Roll on daddy 'til you get back home
Roll on family, roll on crew
Roll on momma like I asked you to do
And roll on eighteen-wheeler
Roll on highway, roll on along
Roll on daddy 'til you get back home
Roll on family, roll on crew
Roll on momma like I asked you to do
And roll on eighteen-wheeler roll on (Roll on)

[Outro]
Eighteen-wheeler
Eighteen-wheeler
Eighteen-wheeler
Eighteen-wheeler
Roll on, roll on, roll on, roll on"
Alabama,Feels So Right,"[Verse 1]
Whisper to me softly
Breathe words upon my skin
No one's near and listening
So please don't say goodbye

[Chorus]
Just hold me close and love me
Press your lips to mine
Mmm, feels so right, feels so right

[Verse 2]
Lying here beside you
I hear the echoes of your sighs
Promise me you'll stay with me
And keep me warm tonight

Just hold me close and love me
Give my heart a smile
Mmm, feels so right, feels so right

Your body feels so gentle
And my passion rises high
You're loving me so easy

Feels so right

Oh how you feel so right baby"
Alabama,Take Me Down,"[Verse 1]
Fly away with me tonight
Take me on a one-way flight in your loving arms
And everything's going to be alright
You're the one who took my hand
When no one else could understand
You're the one who moves me
Like nobody else can

[Chorus]
Take me down where I want to be
Turn around, this man who lives inside of me
Take me down and love me all night long
Hold me close and make me strong
Take me down, take me down tonight

[Verse 2]
In your eyes I see a light
It's your emotions glowing bright
So keep the fires burning
And let it warm me through the night
You can be a part of me
'Cause you're what love was meant to be
You and me, baby
We'll set this flame inside free

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You don't have to stay forever
Let's just put our hearts together
Share another night in ecstasy
We know that it's feeling better
Every time we get together
Maybe love was meant for you and me

Alabama,High Cotton,"[Intro]
Yeah, rockin' chair (One, two)

[Verse 1]
We didn't know the times were lean
'Round our house, the grass was green
It didn't seem like things were all that bad
I bet we walked a thousand miles
Choppin' cotton and pushin' plows
And learnin' how to give it all we had

[Verse 2]
As life went on and years went by
I saw the light in daddy's eyes
And felt the love in mama's hands
They kept us warm and kept us fed
And taught us how to look ahead
Now lookin' back, I understand

[Chorus]
We were walking in high cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Those fertile fields are never far away
We were walking in high cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Leavin' home was the hardest thing we ever faced

[Verse 3]
When Sunday mornings rolled around
We dressed up in hand-me-downs
Just in time to gather with the church
Sometimes I think how long it's been
And how it impressed me then
It was the only day my daddy wouldn't work

[Chorus]
We were walkin' in high cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Those fertile fields are never far away
We were walkin' in high cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Leavin' home was the hardest thing we ever faced
We were walkin' in high cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Those fertile fields are never far away
We were walkin' in high cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Leavin' home was the hardest thing we ever faced
We were walkin' in high cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Those fertile fields are never far away
We were walkin' in high cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Leavin' home was the hardest thing we ever faced

[Outro]
Walkin' in high cotton"
Alabama,She And I,"She and I live in our own little world
Don't worry about the world outside

She and I agree
She and I lead a perfectly normal life
Ah but just because we aren't often seen socially
People think we've got something to hide
But all our friends know we're just a little old fashioned
She and I

Oh ain't that great
Ain't it fine
To have a love someone that others can't find
Ain't it wonderful to know all we ever need is just the two of us
She and I
So wonderful
She and I

She and I share with every body else
The same wants, needs and desires
She and I save
She and I pay on everything we acquire

Ah but just because we aren't often seen separately
People think we live one life

Its hard for them to see how anyone could be as close as
She and I"
Alabama,Jukebox In My Mind,"In the corner of my mind stands a jukebox
It's playin' all my favorite mem-o-ries
One by one, they take me back
To the days when you were mine
And I can't stop this jukebox in my mind

I don't need no quarters, don't need any dime
You filled it up forever
When you said good-bye
Heaven knows I love old melodies
They were meant to ease the pain
But the kind that's playin' on my mind
Are drivin' me insane

In the corner of my mind stands a jukebox
It's playin' all my favorite mem-o-ries
One by one, they take me back
To the days when you were mine
And I can't stop this jukebox in my mind

Song by song, those melodies
Were meant to ease the pain
But the kind that's playin' on my mind
Are drivin' me insane;

In the corner of my mind stands a jukebox
It's playin' all my favorite mem-o-ries
One by one, they take me back
To the days when you were mine
And I can't stop this jukebox in my mind"
Alabama,Love In The First Degree,"[Verse 1]
I once though of love as a prison
A place I didn't want to be
So long ago, I made a decision
To be footloose and fancy-free
But you came and I was so tempted
To gamble on love just one time
I never thought that I would get caught
It seemed like a perfect crime

[Chorus]
Baby, you left me defenseless
But I've only got one plea
Lock me away inside of your love
And throw away the key
I'm guilty, of love in the first degree

[Verse 2]
I thought it would be so simple
Like a thousand times before
I'd take what I wanted and just walk away
But I never made it to the door
Now, babe I'm not begging for mercy
Go ahead and throw the book at me
If loving you's a crime
I know that I'm as guilty as a man can be

[Chorus]
Baby, you left me defenseless
But I've only got one plea
Lock me away inside of your love
And throw away the key
I'm guilty, of love in the first degree
Baby, you left me defenseless
But I've only got one plea
Lock me away inside of your love
And throw away the key
I'm guilty, of love in the first degree

Love in the first degree
Love in the first degree
Love in the first degree
Love in the first degree

Life sounds better

Life sounds better with a southern drawl
Life sounds better
Life sounds better

[Verse 1]
Here's a song for the southland
Chewin' on Redman
It's been all mornin'
Up in the tree stand
Burgers and hot dogs
Livin' for football
Backwoods battle cry made with a duck call
Life's so simple, like sweet ice tea
Here's our down home recipe

We drive trucks, we drink beer
We shoot whiskey and hunt deer
We say things like yes ma'am and howdy ya'll
Life sounds better with a southern drawl

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
We got family tradition, good intentions
Get a little crazy, I love our religion
Apple pie, baseball, honky-tonk, dancehall
[?]
We mind our manners and we talk real slow
Down here buddy, that's the way it goes

We drive trucks, we drink beer
We shoot whiskey and hunt deer
We say things like yes ma'am and howdy ya'll
Life sounds better with a southern drawl

[Bridge]
Country music, mashed potato, nothin' like a ripe tomato
Bible belt to the core, we support our troops at war
Grand Ol' Opry, barbecue, we support Amendment Two
Just about everything is a little better with a twang

We drive trucks, we drink beer
We shoot whiskey and hunt deer
We say things like yes ma'am and howdy ya'll

A sure 'nuff a better, life sounds better
Life sounds better with a southern drawl y'all"
Alabama,I’ll Fly Away,"Some glad morning when this life is o'er
I'll fly away
To a home on God's celestial shore
I'll fly away (I'll fly away)

[Chorus]
I'll fly away, Oh Glory
I'll fly away; (in the morning)
When I die, Hallelujah, by and by
I'll fly away (I'll fly away)
When the shadows of this life have gone
I'll fly away
Like a bird from prison bars has flown
I'll fly away (I'll fly away)

[Chorus]
Just a few more weary days and then
I'll fly away
To a land where joy shall never end
I'll fly away (I'll fly away)

Alabama,My Home’s In Alabama,"[Verse 1]
Drinking was forbidden in my Christian country home
I learned to play the flattop on them good old Gospel songs
Then I heard about the bar rooms just across the Georgia line
Where a boy could make a living playing guitar late at night
Had to learn about the ladies, too young to understand
Why the young girls fall in love with the boys in the band
When the boys turn to music, the girls just turn away
To some other guitar picker in some other late night place
Yeah, held on to my music, I let the ladies walk away
Took my songs and dreams to Nashville then I moved on to L.A
Up to New York City all across the USA
I lost so much of me but there's enough of me to say that my

[Chorus]
Home's in Alabama, no matter where I lay my head
My home's in Alabama, Southern born and Southern bred

[Verse 2]
What keeps me going I don't really know
Can't be the money Lord knows I'm always broke
Could it be the satisfaction of being understood
When the people really love you and let you know when it's good
Oh I'll speak my Southern English just as natural as I please
I'm in the heart of Dixie, Dixie's in the heart of me
And someday when I make it, when love finds a way
Somewhere high on Lookout Mountain I'll just smile with pride and say that my

[Chorus]
Home's in Alabama, no matter where I lay my head
My home's in Alabama, Southern born and Southern bred"
Keith Whitley,When You Say Nothing At All,"[Verse 1]
It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart
Without saying a word, you can light up the dark
Try as I may I could never explain
What I hear when you don't say a thing

[Chorus]
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall
Now you say it best when you say nothing at all

[Verse 2]
All day long I can hear people talking out loud
But when you hold me near you drown out the crowd
Old Mr. Webster could never define
What's being said between your heart and mine

[Chorus]
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall
Now you say it best when you say nothing at all

The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall
Now you say it best when you say nothing at all"
Keith Whitley,Don’t Close Your Eyes,"[Verse 1]
I know you loved him a long time ago
And even now in my arms you still want him I know
But, Darling, this time let your memories die
When you hold me tonight, don't close your eyes

[Chorus]
Don't close your eyes, let it be me
Don't pretend it's him in some fantasy
Darling, just once let yesterday go
And you'll find more love than you've ever known
Just hold me tight when you love me tonight
And don't close your eyes

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Maybe I've been a fool, holding on all this time
Lying here in your arms, knowing he's in your mind
But I keep hoping some day that you'll see the light
Let it be me tonight, don't close your eyes

[Chorus]
Don't close your eyes, let it be me
Don't pretend it's him in some fantasy
Darling, just once let yesterday go
And you'll find more love than you've ever known
Just hold me tight when you love me tonight
And don't close your eyes

[Chorus]
Don't close your eyes, let it be me
Don't pretend it's him in some fantasy
Darling, just once let yesterday go
And you'll find more love than you've ever known
Just hold me tight when you love me tonight
And don't close your eyes

Just hold me tight when you love me tonight
And don't close your eyes"
Keith Whitley,I’m No Stranger To The Rain,"[Verse 1]
I'm no stranger to the rain
I'm a friend of thunder
Friend, is it any wonder lightnin' strikes me
I've fought with the devil
Got down on his level
But I never gave in, so he gave up on me

[Verse 2]
I'm no stranger to the rain
I can spot bad weather
And I'm good at finding shelter in a downpour
I've been sacrificed by brothers
Crucified by lovers
But through it all I withstood the pain
I'm no stranger to the rain

[Bridge]
But when I get that foggy feelin'
When I'm a feelin' down
If I don't keep my head up, I may drown
But it's hard to keep believing
I'll even come out even
While the rain beats your hope in the ground
And tonight it's really comin' down

[Verse 3]
I'm no stranger to the rain
But there'll always be tomorrow
And I'll beg, steal, or borrow a little sunshine
And I'll put this cloud behind me
That's how the Man designed me
To ride the wind and dance in a hurricane
I'm no stranger to the rain
Oh no, I'm no stranger to the rain

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
I'm no stranger to the rain
I'm a friend of thunder
Friend, is it any wonder lightning strikes me
But I'll put this cloud behind me
That's how the Man designed me
Ride the wind and dance in a hurricane
I'm no stranger to the rain, oh no
I'm no stranger to the rain"
Keith Whitley,I Never Go Around Mirrors,"[Verse 1]
I can't stand to see a good man go to waste
One who never combs his hair or shaves his face
A man who leans on wine over love that's told a lie
Oh, it tears me up to see a grown man cry

[Chorus]
So I never go around mirrors
I can't stand to see me without you by my side
No, I never go around mirrors
Because I got a heartache to hide

[Verse 2]
I can't stand to be where heartaches hang around
It's so easy for the blues to get me down
To see a grown man crawl is more than I can stand
And I can't look into the eyes of half a man

[Chorus]
So I never go around mirrors
I can't stand to see me without you by my side
No, I never go around mirrors
Because I got a heartache to hide
And it tears me up to see a grown man cry"
Keith Whitley,"Miami, My Amy","[Verse 1]
Well everybody talks about the California quakes
But the first time I ever felt the earth shake was in Miami
When Amy touched me ah, it shook me
I told her I loved her and I wanted to stay
But she said ""be sure and I'll call you in L. A.""
Even in the taxi I could hear my telephone ring

[Chorus]
Calling me from Miami, my Amy
What took you so long, I thought you'd never call
Miami, my Amy
Miami, my Amy loved me after all

[Verse 2]
Now Amy just called and said, ""please come back""
Said ""I'm on my way babe, I ain't even unpacked""
""I want you, I love you,"" that's all she had to say
Goodbye L. A., now once again I'm Miami bound
Can't wait 'til this plane touches down
Because I know my Amy will be waiting at that Miami gate

[Chorus]
I can't wait, Miami, my Amy
What took you so long, I thought you'd never call
Miami, oh my Amy
Miami, my Amy loves me after all

[Tag]
Miami, my Amy loves me after all"
Keith Whitley,Tell Lorrie I Love Her,"[Verse 1]
If I were alone in the desert
Without a drink of water around
With my knees and hands in that white scorching sand
With the hot Sahara sun beating down
If I could be granted my wishes
And anything I want would come true
Well, I know that it might sound funny
But here's what I want you to do

[Chorus]
Tell Lorrie I love her
Tell Lorrie I need her
Tell her everything would be okay
If I could just see her
Tell Lorrie I love her
Tell Lorrie I need her
And if I leave this old world
Tell her she's the only girl for me

[Verse 2]
If I were adrift on the ocean
A vessel with no sails or steam
Floating aimlessly on an endless sea
Hopelessly lost, it would seem
If all of the fish in the water
Could echo my last dying plea
Well I know you might not understand it
But here's what I want it to be

[Chorus]
Tell Lorrie I love her
Tell Lorrie I need her
Tell her everything would be okay
If I could just see her
Tell Lorrie I love her
Tell Lorrie I need her
And if I leave this old world
Tell her she's the only girl for me
And if I leave this old world
Tell her she's the only girl for me"
Keith Whitley,I’m Over You,"Where there's a cloud, don't mean there's rain
Tears in my eyes, don't mean there's pain
Don't flatter yourself
I'm over you

Things aren't always what they seem
You can't believe everything you read
On my face
I'm over you

You heard I'm drinking more than I should
That I ain't been looking all that good
Someone told you I was taking it rough
Why they making those stories up
When I'm over you

There were times that if you'd been around
You would have seen me broken down
But now you won't
I'm over you

So if I seem a little bit cold
It only means you've lost the hold
You had on me
I'm over you

You heard I'm drinking more than I should
That I ain't been looking all that good
Someone told you I was taking it rough
But why they making those stories up
When I'm over you

You heard I'm drinking more than I should
That I ain't been looking all that good
Someone told you I was taking it rough
But why they making those stories up
When I'm over you
I'm over you
I'm over you"
Keith Whitley,Charlotte’s In North Carolina,"Verse 1:
I watched the taxi take her away
Through the window she was waving goodbye
There wasn't much left to say
Her last ""I love you"" was a lie
Did she leave me for somebody else
And just leave me behind
All she left me was by myself
And if that plane arrives on time

Chorus:
Charlotte's in North Carolina
Back where she wanted to be
Charlotte's in North Carolina
She left me here in Saint Louis in misery

Verse 2:
I was kinda hoping she'd call
Let me know she made it okay
Now that phone's driving me up the wall
It hasn't rung all day
I hope she finds what she's looking for
That's all that matters to me
Cause all it cost me was my heart
To set my sweet Charlotte free"
Keith Whitley,Kentucky Bluebird,"Blown down the highway by two different winds
Lord only knows when I'll see you again
You're 'bout as close as the stars up above
You're my long distance love
Kentucky Bluebird, I heard your song today
But when I try to touch you, you fly away
Blue is a feeling I'm learning so well
Turn on the TV in another hotel
Turn down the volume and stare at the wall
God I wish you would call
Kentucky Bluebird, I heard your song today
But when I try to touch you, you fly away
How I hate the miles between us
They get longer each day
I had this dream and you should have seen us
Holding each other and drifting away
Kentucky Bluebird, I heard your song today
But when I try to touch you, you fly away
You fly away"
Keith Whitley,There’s A New Kid In Town,"We're looking for The King
The new Messiah
We're following the star
Shining brighter
Old man
Won't you help us if you can?
He shook his head
But he pointed his hand
There's a new kid in town
And he's lying in a manger down the road
There's a new kid in town
But he's just another baby I suppose
Heaven knows
There's a new kid in town
Here in Bethlehem
I see you've traveled far
Bearing treasures
You say these gifts are for
The new Kings pleasures
Well, I've heard
That a King might come
But up 'til now
There hasn't been one
There's a new kid in town
And he's lying in a manger down the road
There's a new kid in town
But he's just another baby I suppose
Heaven knows
There's a new kid in town
Here in Bethlehem
There's a new kid in town
And he's lying in a manger down the road
There's a new kid in town
But he's just another baby I suppose
Heaven knows
There's a new kid in town
Here in Bethlehem"
Keith Whitley,I Wonder Do You Think Of Me,"[Verse 1]
If you drive around back in our old hometown
I wonder, do you think of me
When you drive by a school, do you remember two fools
I wonder, do you think of me

[Chorus]
And remember the park where you struck the spark
To a fire that's still burning oh, in my heart
That old graduation day you just drifted away
I wonder, do you think of me

[Verse 2]
And remember those games, those cold football games
I was your hero though I seldom played
Back then could you see what our future would be
I wonder, do you think of me

[Chorus]
And the classes we missed, caused by a kiss
I can tell you that I've never felt like that since
I don't know if you would, but I'd go back if I could
I wonder, do you think of me

[Tag]
I still love you
Do you think of me"
Keith Whitley,Somebody’s Doin’ Me Right,"Runnin' around
I've spent my whole life runnin' around
Settlin' down
I never dreamed I'd be settlin' down

But something's comin' over me
Woman, you have got a hold on me
And the reason just might be
You're so good to me

Somebody's doin' me right
Somebody's holdin' me tight
Sharin' my days and my nights
Somebody I really like
Just took a hold of my hand
You make me feel like a man
There's been a change in my life
Somebody's doin' me right

It's alright
Oh girl it's alright

Set in my ways
Thinkin' that love would only get in my way
But now I'm wantin' to stay
I like this feelin' of wantin' to stay

Really it's no mystery
What brought all this change in me
You're the one who made me see
How love was meant to be

Somebody's doin' me right
Somebody's holdin' me tight
Sharin' my days and my nights
Somebody I really like
Just took a hold of my hand
You make me feel like a man
There's been a change in my life

There's been a change in my life
Somebody's doin' me right"
Keith Whitley,I Wonder Where You Are Tonight,"Tonight, I'm sad, my heart is weary
Wondering if I'm wrong or right
To dream about you though you left me
I wonder where you are tonight
CHORUS
The rain is cold and slowly fallin'
Upon my windowpane tonight
And though our love was even colder
I wonder where you are tonight
Your heart was cold, you never loved me
Though you've often said you cared
And now, you've gone to find another
Someone who'll know the love I share
CHORUS
The rain is cold and slowly fallin'
Upon my windowpane tonight
And though our love was even colder
I wonder where you are tonight
I wonder where you are tonight"
Keith Whitley,Ten Feet Away,"Alone at a corner table
She was watching me watching her
I was singin' about an old flame burning
She was hanging on to every word

I was pouring out my feelings
She was pouring out the wine
Through the smoke and the beer
It was perfectly clear
That we were touching each others minds

It was love ten feet away
Imagine her in my arms, with that look on her face
Lying somewhere in some shadowy place
It was love just ten feet away

I just knew my closing song would do it
I knew that I was heaven bound
I could tell she was moved, but before I was through
This stranger walked up and set down

He was trying his best to impress her
But she never took her eyes off me
When he got up and left, I said to myself...
Woh-o-woh what a night this will be

It was love ten feet away
Imagine her in my arms, with that look on her face
Lying somewhere in some shadowy place
It was love just ten feet away

It was love ten feet away
Imagine her in my arms, with that look on her face
Lying somewhere in some shadowy place
It was love just ten feet away"
Keith Whitley,I Want My Rib Back,"Now the bible tells the story about Adam's rib
How the Lord made a woman for companionship
And the first thing she did was take a bite of that forbidden fruit
Well, I guess we'll be paying till the end of time
At least that's how it is with that woman of mine
Oh Lord, I think I want my rib back
Now this is wrong and baby, that ain't right
And I'm huggin' tryin' to please that woman day and night
She's never satisfied although I try to do the best that I can
Somethin's got a change honey, I'm gonna leave
I won't let evolution gonna make a monkey out of me
Oh Lord, I think I want my rib back
There's been a hole in wallet and a pain in my side
Ever since I made that girl my blushing bride
Her daddy calls her angel and her momma calls her three times a night
Her cousins on the sofa, her sister's got my car
Her brother's drink my liquor like my house was a bar
Oh Lord, well, I think I want my rib back
Now this is wrong and, baby, that ain't right
And I'm huggin' tryin' to please that woman day and night
She's never satisfied although I try to do the best that I can
Somethin's got a change honey, I'm gonna leave
I won't let evolution gonna make a monkey out of me
Oh Lord, I think I want my rib back
Oh Lord, I think I want my rib back"
Keith Whitley,Nobody In His Right Mind Would’ve Left Her,"I burn with desire each time my heart fans the fire
To that old flame that burns inside of me
She cried when I left her now I cry to forget her
Oh, how foolish I was to ever want to leave

Nobody in his right mind would've left her
I had to be crazy to say goodbye
Nobody in his right mind would've left her
Even my heart was smart enough to stay behind

I still carry her picture I wish her well
With the new love I know she's found by now
Each night finds me dreaming each day I spend thinking
How much I wish she was still around

'Cause nobody in his right mind would've left her
I had to be crazy to say goodbye
Nobody in his right mind would've left her
Even my heart was smart enough to stay behind

Even my heart was smart enough to stay behind"
Keith Whitley,Homecoming ’63,"[Verse 1]
Homecoming '63
I was so proud you went with me
Everyone turned their head when we walked in
They said look at that perfect pair
As you blushed from all their stares
And my chest swelled up with pride
Grinning from ear to ear inside
An hour full of dance and fun
An hour later and I gunned
My '57 off to heaven
Back seat lovin' girl you were somethin'

[Chorus]
Homecoming '63
You went home with the love you gave to me
You turned me on to ecstasy
Homecoming '63

[Verse 2]
What a night that was for us
I remember plain as day the touch
I felt when I felt your love melt in my arms
And that old and pleated backseat bed
I pleaded with you and instead
Of the usual no you said yes
You let go

[Chorus]
Homecoming '63
You went home with the love you gave to me
You turned me on to ecstasy
Homecoming '63
Homecoming '63"
Keith Whitley,It Ain’t Nothin’,"[Verse 1]
My boss is the boss' son and that makes for a real long day
When that day is finally done I'm facing forty-thousand cars on the Interstate
Feeling lower than a well digger's shoes
Knee deep in a mess of blues
But those blues just fade away
When I hear my baby say

[Chorus]
It ain't nothin' a little bit of love won't fix
It ain't nothin' but a scratch, a little bit of love can't stitch
It ain't nothin' a little bit of love can't heal
Your love makes me feel
No matter what hell life deals
It ain't nothin', it ain't nothin'

[Verse 2]
It was written all over her face
She was about to climb the walls
She said you gotta get me out of this place
'Cause even Cinderella got to go to the ball
If you multiply hell times three
That's what this day's been like for me
I said, ""Honey, we'll do the town
Just don't let it get you down""

[Chorus]
'Cause it ain't nothin' a little bit of love won't fix
It ain't nothin' but a scratch a little bit of love can't stitch
It ain't nothin' a little bit of love can't heal
Your love makes me feel
No matter what hell life deals
It ain't nothin'

[Chorus]
It ain't nothin' a little bit of love won't fix
It ain't nothin' but a scratch a little bit of love can't stitch
It ain't nothin' a little bit of love can't heal
Your love makes me feel
No matter what hell life deals
It ain't nothin', it ain't nothin'

[Tag]
Naw, it ain't nothin'
It ain't nothin'
Naw, it ain't nothin'
Well it ain't nothin'
Naw, it ain't nothin'
Naw, it ain't nothin'
It ain't nothin'
Naw, it ain't nothin'"
Keith Whitley,I’m Gonna Hurt Her On The Radio,"I'm gonna hurt her on the radio
She's gonna hear me everywhere she goes
I'll get revenge the only way I know
I'm gonna hurt her on the radio

Take these pieces of this broken heart
I'll watch them climb the country music charts
She's going to pay me back in royalties
For bringing me down to my knees

I'm gonna hurt her on the radio
She's gonna hear me everywhere she goes
I'll get revenge the only way I know
I'm gonna hurt her on the radio

Gonna tell the world the way she done me wrong
Make a million while she sings along
She thinks she's heard the last of my love song
But she won't feel that way for long

I'm gonna hurt her on the radio
She's gonna hear me everywhere she goes
I'll be hurting down inside I know
I'm gonna hurt her on the radio

I'm gonna hurt her on the radio
I'm gonna get to her in stereo
I'll get revenge the only way I know
I'm gonna hurt her on the radio

I'm gonna hurt her on the radio
She's gonna hear me everywhere she goes
I'll get revenge the only way I know
I'm gonna hurt her on the radio"
Keith Whitley,Hard Livin’,"Well you can call out the sheriff and the highway patrol
Cause there's a fool on the road careenin' out of control
Hard liquor fast women I just can't let 'em be
Lord I wish hard livin' didn't come so easy for me

Well I keep my motor runnin' got my beer on the ice
And my idea of heaven is a pair of dice
Seven come on eight set this poor boy free
Lord I wish hard livin' didn't come so easy for me

Bright lights Saturday night I had a couple and I'm feeling alright
My cupcake she can wiggle and shake spend more money than anybody make

So give me a shot of that octane juice
You know where ain't no cure for the honky tonk blues
And if they come up with somethin' I'll develop an immunity
And I wish hard livin' didn't come easy for me

Out on the town just a foolin' around
Hey I got my mind on the lost and found
Step up no need to be shy
All right pretty women you got the ticket to ride

When my tires are flat and I'm out of gas
I promise myself I'll let the next one pass
Lord I wish that a promise didn't break so easily
And I wish hard livin' didn't come easy for me
Hey I wish hard livin' didn't come easy for me"
Keith Whitley,Would These Arms Be In Your Way,"Would you like to hear I love you all the time
And if you couldn't turn around without us touching would you mind
You know there's something missing 'round your waist
Tell me would these arms be in your way

Would you mind another heart beating for you
Two ears that listen you could talk to
Kisses filled with feeling on your face..
Now tell me would these arms be in your way

Would you mind another heart beating for you
Two ears that listen you can talk to
Kisses filled with feeling on your face
Darlin tell me would these arms be in your way
Now tell me would these arms be in your way.."
Keith Whitley,Light At The End Of The Tunnel,"There's a light at the end of the tunnel
There's a chance that it ain't gonna rain
There's a light at the end of the tunnel
And for once it ain't a fast moving train

All these lines in my face tell a story
Though I've never been one to complain
It's a roadmap of hard luck and glory
And some places I won't see again

There's a light at the end of the tunnel
There's a chance that it ain't gonna rain
There's a light at the end of the tunnel
And for once it ain't a fast moving train

I've been sheltered and shattered and shaken
By the lessons that life made me learn
There were choices and chances worth taking
And some bridges I hated to burn

There's a light at the end of the tunnel
There's a chance that it ain't gonna rain
There's a light at the end of the tunnel
And for once it ain't a fast moving train"
Keith Whitley,Tennessee Courage,"When they open the bar, I'll be there on the stool
And forget all my cares in a hurry
And it's my belief that I find relief
In a bottle of Tennessee courage
Her memory keeps waitin', in a line every night
Along with the rest of my worries
But I'll never crawl, I can hold up the walk
With the help of some Tennessee courage

Now my good friend Jack Daniels, stands tall on the shelf
And he'll go to war with my troubles
And he'll never desert this old friend when I'm hurt
And needin' some Tennessee courage

Straight 90 proof, can alter the truth
Put hair on your chest in a hurry
How do I survive, raise a hell for a while
With the help of some Tennessee courage

Now my good friend Jack Daniels, stands tall on the shelf
And he'll go to war with my troubles
And he'll never desert, this old friend when I'm hurt
And needin' some Tennessee courage
No he'll never desert, this old friend when I'm hurt
And needin' some Tennessee courage
So pour me some Tennessee Courage"
Keith Whitley,Between An Old Memory And Me,"I was sittin' at a table
In a little club downtown
Playin' songs on the jukebox
And pourin' whiskey down

When I heard a sweet voice sayin'
""Would you like some company?""
And I had to tell her
This is just between
An old memory and me

All my friends tell me
That I'm a fool for holding on
I know their trying to help me
But I've been a fool too long

And I don't want to talk about it
So why can't they just let me be?
'Cause this is just between
An old memory and me

And I'm not hurtin' anybody
As far as I can see
I just need to be alone sometimes
While she goes walkin' through my mind

Oh, I'm not hurtin' anybody, yeah
As far as I can see
I just need to be alone sometimes
While she goes walkin' through my mind

And I don't want to talk about it
So why can't everybody see?
This is just between
An old memory and me

Oh, yeah, yeah
This is just between
Her memory and me"
Keith Whitley,I Get The Picture,"The moving van is waitin' for the rain to stop
Your agent put a sign up in the yard
I wondered was there anything that you'd forgot
I guess that goodbye's got to be this hard

One last look around the rooms that we both shared
I knew I couldn't stay here by myself
I saw a box and wondered why you'd left it out
Right there on the bedroom closet shelf

Faded yellow photos of a boy and girl
Smiling in the blazing Texas sun
It must have been the year before your daddy died
He tried to warn me then this day would come

I get the picture though the love has gone away
I get the picture though your memory will fade I get the picture

Wasn't that the guy you told me you forgot
Oh what's his name who never made you laugh
But I never made you smile the way you're smilin' here
By his side in this faded photograph

Last night when I met you at your lawyer's house
I wondered bout the guy who dropped you off
Guess I prob'ly never place this smiling face
If you hadn't left behind this box

I get the picture though the love has gone away
I get the picture though your memory will fade I get the picture

I get the picture"
Alan Jackson,Chattahoochee,"[Verse 1]
Well way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
It gets hotter than a hoochie coochie
We laid rubber on the Georgia asphalt
We got a little crazy but we never got caught

[Pre-Chorus]
Down by the river on a Friday night
A pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Talkin' about cars and dreamin' about women
Never had a plan just a livin' for the minute

[Chorus]
Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
A lot about livin' and a little about love
Aw haw

[Verse 2]
Well we fogged up the windows in my old chevy
I was willin' but she wasn't ready
So I settled for a burger and a grape snow cone
I dropped her off early but I didn't go home

[Pre-Chorus]
Down by the river on a Friday night
A pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Talkin' about cars and dreamin' about women
Never had a plan just a livin' for the minute

[Chorus]
Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
A lot about livin' and a little about love
[Verse 1]
Well way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
It gets hotter than a hoochie coochie
We laid rubber on the Georgia asphalt
We got a little crazy but we never got caught

[Verse 2]
Well we fogged up the windows in my old chevy
I was willin' but she wasn't ready
So I settled for a burger and a grape snow cone
I dropped her off early but I didn't go home

[Pre-Chorus]
Down by the river on a Friday night
A pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Talkin' about cars and dreamin' about women
Never had a plan just a living for the minute

[Chorus]
Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
A lot about livin' and a little about love
A lot about livin' and a little about love

[Outro]
Yeah-eee
That's right"
Alan Jackson,Remember When,"[Verse 1]
Remember when
I was young and so were you
And time stood still and love was all we knew
You were the first, so was I
We made love and then you cried
Remember when

[Verse 2]
Remember when
We vowed the vows and walked the walk
Gave our hearts, made the start, and it was hard
We lived and learned, life threw curves
There was joy, and there was hurt
Remember when

[Verse 3]
Remember when
Old ones died and the new were born
And life was changed, disassembled, rearranged
We came together, fell apart
And broke each other's hearts
Remember when

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
Remember when
The sound of little feet
Was the music we danced to week to week
Brought back the love, we found trust
Vowed we'd never give it up
Remember when

[Verse 5]
Remember when
Thirty seemed so old
Now looking back, it's just a stepping stone
To where we are, where we've been
Said we'd do it all again
Remember when

[Verse 6]
Remember when
We said when we turned gray
When the children grow up and move away
We won't be sad, we'll be glad
For all the life we've had
And we'll remember when

[Outro]
Remember when
Remember when"
Alan Jackson,It’s Five O’Clock Somewhere,"[Verse 1: Alan Jackson]
The sun is hot and that old clock is movin' slow
An' so am I
Work day passes like molasses in wintertime
But it's July
I'm gettin' paid by the hour, an' older by the minute
My boss just pushed me over the limit
I'd like to call him somethin'
I think I'll just call it a day

[Chorus: Alan Jackson]
Pour me somethin' tall an' strong
Make it a ""Hurricane"" before I go insane
It's only half-past twelve but I don't care
It's five o'clock somewhere

[Verse 2: Alan Jackson]
Oh, this lunch break is gonna take all afternoon
An' half the night
Tomorrow mornin', I know there'll be hell to pay
Hey, but that's alright
I ain't had a day off now in over a year
Our Jamaican vacation's gonna start right here
If the phone’s for me
You can tell 'em I just sailed away

[Chorus: Alan Jackson]
And pour me somethin' tall an' strong
Make it a ""Hurricane"" before I go insane
It's only half-past twelve but I don't care
It's five o'clock somewhere

[Bridge: Alan Jackson, Jimmy Buffett, Both]
I could pay off my tab, pour myself in a cab
An' be back to work before two
At a moment like this, I can't help but wonder
What would Jimmy Buffett do?
Funny you should ask Alan, I'd say:
""Pour me somethin' tall an' strong
Make it a ""Hurricane"" before I go insane
It's only half-past twelve but I don't care""
Pour me somethin' tall an' strong
Make it a ""Hurricane"" before I go insane
It's only half-past twelve but I don't care
He don't care
And I don't care
It's five o'clock somewhere

[Outro: Alan Jackson & Jimmy Buffett]
What time zone am I on? What country am I in?
It doesn't matter, it's five o'clock somewhere
It's always on five in Margaritaville, come to think of it
Yeah, I heard that
You been, there haven't you?
Yessir
I seen your boat there
I've been to Margaritaville a few times
Alright, that's good
Stumbled all the way back
Okay, just wanna make sure you can keep it between the navigational beacons
Ha ha ha ha, between the buoys, I tell you
Alright. Well, it's five o'clock. Let's go somewhere
I'm ready, crank it up
Let's get out of here
I'm gone"
Alan Jackson,The Older I Get,"[Verse 1]
The older I get
The more I think
You only get a minute, better live while you’re in it
'Cause it’s gone in a blink
And the older I get
The truer it is
It’s the people you love, not the money and stuff
That makes you rich

[Chorus]
And if they found a fountain of youth
I wouldn’t drink a drop and that’s the truth
Funny how it feels I’m just getting to my best years yet

[Verse 2]
The older I get
The fewer friends I have
But you don’t need a lot when the ones that you got
Have always got your back
And the older I get
The better I am
At knowing when to give
And when to just not give a damn

[Chorus]
And if they found a fountain of youth
I wouldn’t drink a drop and that’s the truth
Funny how it feels I’m just getting to my best years yet
The older I get

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
And I don’t mind all the lines
From all the times I’ve laughed and cried
Souvenirs and little signs of the life I’ve lived

[Verse 3]
The older I get
The longer I pray
I don’t know why, I guess that I've
Got more to say
And the older I get
The more thankful I feel
For the life I’ve had, and all the life I’m living still"
Alan Jackson,Drive (For Daddy Gene),"[Verse 1]
It was painted red, the stripe was white
It was eighteen feet from the bow to stern light
Secondhand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with Daddy when he went there to get her
We put on a shine, put on a motor
Built out of love, and made for the water
Ran her for years, 'til the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood will never be forgotten

[Chorus]
It was just an old plywood boat
With a '75 Johnson and electric choke
A young boy, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would turn her sharp
And I would make it whine
He'd say, ""You can't beat the way an old wood boat rides""
Just a little lake 'cross the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When Daddy let me drive

[Verse 2]
Just an old half ton short bed Ford
My Uncle bought new in '64
Daddy got it right 'cause the engine was smoking
A couple of burnt valves and he had it going
He'd let me drive her when we'd haul off a load
Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thigpen Road
I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals
Smiling like a hero that just received his medal

[Chorus]
It was just an old hand me down Ford
With three speed on the column and a dent in the door
A young boy, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel and
I would press that clutch
And I'd keep it right
He'd say ""A little slower son, you're doing just fine""
Just a dirt road with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti
When Daddy let me drive

[Bridge]
I'm grown up now, three daughters of my own
I let them drive my old Jeep
Across the pasture at our home
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile and say

[Chorus]
It was just an old worn out Jeep
With rusty old floorboards, hot on my feet
A young girl, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And he'd say ""Turn it left"" and ""Steer it right""
Straighten up girl now, you're doing just fine
Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
But I was high on a mountain
When Daddy let me drive
When Daddy let me drive
Oh he let me drive

[Outro]
It was just an old plywood boat
With a '75 Johnson and electric choke"
Alan Jackson,Good Time,"[Verse 1]
Work, work all week long
Punching that clock from dusk till dawn
Counting the days till Friday night
That's when all the conditions are right
For a good time
I need a good time

[Chorus]
I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time

[Verse 2]
I cashed my check, cleaned my truck
Put on my hat, forgot about work
Sun going down, head across town
Pick up my baby and turn it around
Good time
Ahh, I need a good time

[Chorus]
I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time

[Verse 3]
Pig in the ground, beer on ice
Just like ole Hank taught us about
Singing along, Bocephus songs
Rowdy friends, all night long
Good time
Lord, we're having a good time

[Chorus]
I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time
Whew!

[Verse 4]
Heel toe, do-si-do
Scooting our boots, swinging doors
B & D, Kix and Dunn
Honking tonk heaven, Double shotgun
Good time
Lord, we're having a good time
Cause

[Chorus]
I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time

[Verse 5]
Shot of Tequila, beer on tap
Sweet southern woman set on my lap
G with an O, O with a D
T with an I and an M and an E
And a good time
Shhheww, good time

[Chorus]
I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time

[Bridge]
Ahh, turn it up now!
A shot of Tequila
Beer on tap
A good looking woman
To set on my lap
A G with an O, an O with a D
A T with an I an M with an E
That spells good time
A good time
Ohh

[Chorus]
I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time

[Verse 6]
Twelve o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock four
Five o'clock we know we're that's going to go
Closing the door, shutting them down
Head for that Waffle House way across town
Good time?
Ohh, we're having a good time
Ohh

[Chorus]
I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time

I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time

I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time

[Outro]
Ohh, yea, a good time
I need a good time
Yea, a good time"
Alan Jackson,Freight Train,"[Verse 1]
I just came down from Chippewa
Had a station wagon and a hundred dollars
Thinking about the girl I'd lost a year before
I hadn't seen her for some time
Thought I might go on by
When your memory came flooding in and you closed that door

[Chorus]
Wish I was a freight train, baby
Wish I was a diesel locomotive
I'd come whistling down your track
Crashing in your doorway
Wish I was a freight train, baby
Wish I didn't have a heart
You need a shovel for the coal
Just to get me started
Wish I was a freight train, baby
Wish I was a freight train, baby
Wish I was a freight train

[Verse 2]
Well, every time I talk to you I hear your jealous lies
I feel like I've been left abandoned on some old railway side
And every time I hear your voice my water just gets cold
My stoker will not stoke and my boiler will not boil

[Chorus]
Wish I was a freight train, baby
Wish I was a diesel locomotive
I'd come whistling down your track
Crashing in your doorway
Wish I was a freight train, baby
Wish I didn't have a heart
You need a shovel for the coal
Just to get me started
Wish I was a freight train, baby
Wish I was a freight train, baby
Wish I was a freight train

[Verse 3]
Well, every time I fell behind I could not get ahead
I wish someone would pull the lever and give me a little sand
And every time I slip behind even further back
I wish some switch man would come out of the fog and change my track

[Chorus]
Wish I was a freight train, baby
Wish I was a diesel locomotive
I'd come whistling down your track
Crashing in your doorway
Wish I was a freight train, baby
Wish I didn't have a heart
You need a shovel for the coal
Just to get me started
Wish I was a freight train, baby
Wish I was a freight train, baby
Wish I was a freight train

[Chorus]
Wish I was a freight train, baby
Wish I was a diesel locomotive
I'd come whistling down your track
Crashing in your doorway
Wish I was a freight train, baby
Wish I didn't have a heart
You need a shovel for the coal
Just to get me started
Wish I was a freight train, baby
Wish I was a freight train, baby
Wish I was a freight train"
Alan Jackson,Where I Come From,"[Verse 1]
Well, I was rollin' wheels and shiftin' gears 'round that Jersey Turnpike
When Barney stopped me with his gun ten minutes after midnight
Said, ""Sir, you broke the limit, in this rusty old truck
I don't know about that accent, son, just where did you come from?""

[Chorus]
I said, ""Where I come from, it's cornbread and chicken""
Where I come from, a lot of front porch sittin'
Where I come from, tryin' to make a livin'
And workin' hard to get to heaven, where I come from

[Verse 2]
Well, I was south of Detroit City, I pulled in this country kitchen
To try their brand of barbecue, the sign said finger-lickin'
Well, I paid the tab, and the lady asked me how'd I like my biscuit
""I'll be honest with you ma'am, it ain't like mama fixed it""

[Chorus]
'Cause where I come from, it's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from, lot of front porch pickin'
Where I come from, tryin' to make a livin'
And workin' hard to get to heaven, where I come from

[Verse 3]
I was chasin' sun on 101, somewhere around Ventura
And I lost a universal joint, and I had to use my finger
This tall lady stopped and asked if I had plans for dinner
Said, ""No, thanks, ma'am, back home, we like the girls who'd sing soprano""

[Chorus]
'Cause where I come from, it's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from, a lot of front porch sittin'
Where I come from, tryin' to make a livin'
And workin' hard to get to heaven, where I come from

[Verse 4]
Well, I was headin' home on 65, somewhere around Kentucky
And the CB rang for the bobtail rig, it's rollin' on like thunder
Well, I answered him and he asked me, ""Aren't you from out in Tulsa?""
""Nah, but you might've seen me there, I just dropped a load of salsa""

[Chorus]
Where I come from, it's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from, a lot of front porch pickin'
Where I come from, tryin' to make a livin'
And workin' hard to get to heaven, where I come—
Where I come from, yeah, it's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from, a lot of back porch pickin'
Where I come from, tryin' to make a livin'
And workin' hard to get to heaven, where I come from

[Outro]
Where I come from
Yeah, where I come from
A lot of front porch sittin'
And starin' up at heaven, where I come from
Where I come from
Trying to make a livin'
Oh, where I come from
Where I come from"
Alan Jackson,Where Were You (When The World Stopped Turning),"[Verse 1]
Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day?
Were you in the yard with your wife and children
Or working on some stage in L.A.?
Did you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke
Rising against that blue sky?
Did you shout out in anger in fear for your neighbor
Or did you just sit down and cry?

[Verse 2]
Did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones
And pray for the ones who don't know?
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
And sob for the ones left below?
Did you burst out with pride for the red, white and blue
And the heroes who died just doing what they do?
Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer
And look at yourself and what really matters?

[Chorus]
I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell
You the difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
Faith, hope and love are some good things he gave us
And the greatest is love

[Verse 3]
Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day?
Were you teaching a class full of innocent children
Or driving down some cold interstate?
Did you feel guilty because you're a survivor
In a crowded room did you feel alone?
Did you call up your mother and tell her you loved her?
Did you dust off that Bible at home?

[Verse 4]
Did you open your eyes, and hope it never happened
Close your eyes and not go to sleep?
Did you notice the sunset for the first time in ages
Or speak to some stranger on the street?
Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow?
Or go out and buy you a gun?
Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watching?
And turn on ""I Love Lucy"" reruns?

[Bridge]
Did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers?
Stand in line and give your own blood?
Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family
Thank God you had somebody to love?

[Chorus]
I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell
You the difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
Faith, hope and love are some good things he gave us
And the greatest is love

[Chorus]
I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell
You the difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
Faith, hope and love are some good things he gave us
And the greatest is love

[Outro]
And the greatest is love
And the greatest is love
Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day?"
Alan Jackson,Blessed Assurance,"[Verse 1]
Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine!
O what a foretaste of glory divine!
Heir of salvation, purchase of God
Born of his Spirit, washed in his blood

[Chorus]
This is my story, this is my song
Praising my Savior all the day long;
This is my story, this is my song
Praising my Savior all the day long

[Verse 2]
Perfect submission, perfect delight
Visions of rapture now burst on my sight
Angels descending bring from above
Echoes of mercy, whispers of love

[Chorus]"
Alan Jackson,What A Friend We Have In Jesus,"[Verse]
What a friend we have in Jesus
All our sins and griefs to bear!
What a privilege to carry
Everything to God in prayer!
O what peace we often forfeit
O what needless pain we bear
All because we do not carry
Everything to God in prayer
Have we trials and temptations?
Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged;
Take it to the Lord in prayer
Can we find a friend so faithful
Who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our every weakness
Take it to the Lord in prayer"
Alan Jackson,Country Boy,"[Verse 1]
Excuse me ma'am, I saw you walking
I turned around, I'm not a stalker
Where you going? Maybe I can help you
My tank is full, I'd be obliged to take you

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a country boy, I got a four-wheel drive
Climb in my bed and I'll take you for a ride
Up city streets, down country roads
I can get you where you need to go
'Cause I'm a country boy

[Verse 2]
You sure look good sitting in my right seat
Buckle up and I'll take you through the five speeds
Wind it up or I can slow it way down
In the woods or right up town

[Chorus]
I'm a country boy, I got a four-wheel drive
Climb in my bed and I'll take you for a ride
Up city streets, down country roads
Yeah I can get you where you need to go
'Cause I'm a country boy

[Verse 3]
Big thirty-fives, whining on the asphalt
Grabbing mud and slinging up some red dirt
'Cause I'm a country boy

[Verse 4]
My mufflers loud, dual Thrush tubes
Crank the music and the tone gets real good
Let me know when we're getting close
You can slide on out or we can head on down the road

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a country boy, I got a four-wheel drive
Climb in my bed and I'll take you for a ride
Up city streets, down country roads
Yeah, I can get you where you want to go
'Cause I'm a country boy

[Bridge]
Bucket seats, soft as babies nude butt
Locking hubs to take you through a deep rut

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a country boy, I got a four-wheel drive
Climb in my bed and I'll take you for a ride
Up city streets, down winding roads
Yeah I can get you where you need to go
'Cause I'm a country boy

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm a country boy, I got a four-wheel drive
Climb in my bed and I'll take you for a ride
Up city streets, down country roads
I can get you where you want to go
'Cause I'm a country boy

[Outro]
Yeah, I'm a country boy
Ah, I'm just a country boy
A nice little country boy"
Alan Jackson,The Old Rugged Cross,"[Verse 1]
On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross
The emblem of suffering and shame
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain

[Chorus]
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown

[Verse 2]
To the old rugged cross I will ever be true
It's shame and reproach gladly bear
Then he'll call me some day to my home far away
Where his glory forever I'll share

[Chorus]
And I'll cherish the old rugged cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down
And I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown

[Outro]
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown"
Alan Jackson,Midnight in Montgomery,"[Verse 1]
Midnight in Montgomery, Silver Eagle, lonely road
I was on my way to Mobile, for a big New Year's Eve show
I stopped for just a minute, to see a friend outside of town
Put my collar up, I found his name, and felt the wind die down

[Verse 2]
And a drunk man in a cowboy hat took me by surprise
Wearing shiny boots, a Nudie suit, and haunting haunted eyes
He said friend it's good to see you, it's nice to know you care
Then the wind picked up and he was gone, was he ever really there?

[Chorus]
'Cause it's midnight in Montgomery
Just hear that whip-poor-will
See the stars light up the purple sky
Feel that lonesome chill
'Cause when the wind is right you'll hear his songs
Smell whiskey in the air
Midnight in Montgomery
He's always singing there

[Verse 3]
Well I climbed back on that Eagle, took one last look around
Through red tail lights, a shadow moved, slow across the ground
And off somewhere a midnight train is slowly passing by
I can hear that whistle moan, I'm so lonesome I could cry

[Chorus]
'Cause it's midnight in Montgomery
Just hear that whip-poor-will
See the stars light up the purple sky
Feel that lonesome chill
'Cause when the wind is right you'll hear his songs
Smell whiskey in the air
Midnight in Montgomery
He's always singing there

[Outro]
Yeah, he's always singing there
Oh, Hank's always singing there"
Alan Jackson,I Want To Stroll Over Heaven With You,"[Verse 1]
If I survey all the good things that come to me from above
If I count all the blessings from the storehouse of love
I'd simply ask for the favor of him beyond mortal king
And I'm sure he would grant it again

[Chorus]
I want to stroll over Heaven with you some glad day
When all our troubles and heartaches are vanished away
Then we'll enjoy the beauty where all things are new
I want to stroll over Heaven with you

[Verse 2]
So many places of beauty we long to see here below
But time and treasures have kept us from making plans as you know
But come the morning of rapture together we'll stand a new
While I stroll over Heaven with you

[Chorus]
I want to stroll over Heaven with you some glad day
When all our troubles and heartaches are vanished away
Then we'll enjoy the beauty where all things are new
I want to stroll over Heaven with you"
Alan Jackson,Little Bitty,"[Verse 1]
Have a little love on a little honeymoon
You got a little dish and you got a little spoon
A little bitty house and a little bitty yard
A little bitty dog and a little bitty car

[Chorus]
Well, it's alright to be little bitty
A little hometown or a big old city
Might as well share, might as well smile
Life goes on for a little bitty while

[Verse 2]
A little bitty baby in a little bitty gown
It'll grow up in a little bitty town
Big yellow bus and little bitty books
It all started with a little bitty look

[Chorus]
Well, it's alright to be little bitty
A little hometown or a big old city
Might as well share, might as well smile
Life goes on for a little bitty while

Hehyeee!

[Verse 3]
You know you got a job and a little bitty cheque
A six pack of beer and television set
Little bitty world goes around and around
Little bit of silence and a little bit of sound

[Bridge]
A good ole boy and a pretty little girl
Start all over in a little bitty world
Little bitty plan and a little bitty dream
It's all part of a little bitty scheme

[Chorus]
It's alright to be little bitty
A little hometown or a big old city
Might as well share, might as well smile
Life goes on for a little bitty while

It's alright to be little bitty
A little hometown or a big old city
Might as well share, might as well smile
Life goes on for a little bitty while"
Alan Jackson,Here in the Real World,"[Verse 1]
Cowboys don't cry and heroes don't die
Good always wins again and again
And love is a sweet dream that always comes true
Oh, if life were like the movies, I'd never be blue

[Chorus]
But here in the real world, it's not that easy at all
'Cause when hearts get broken, it's real tears that fall
And darling, it's sad but true, but the one thing I've learned from you
Is how the boy don't always get the girl here in the real world

[Verse 2]
I gave you my love, but that wasn't enough
To hold your heart when times got rough
And tonight on that silver screen, it'll end like it should
Two lovers will make it through, like I hoped we would

[Chorus]
But here in the real world, it's not that easy at all
'Cause when hearts get broken, it's real tears that fall
And darling, it's sad but true, but the one thing I've learned from you
Is how the boy don't always get the girl here in the real world

[Outro]
No, the boy don't always get the girl here in the real world"
Alan Jackson,Livin’ on Love,"[Verse 1]
Two young people without a thing
Say some vows and spread their wings
And settle down with just what they need
Livin' on love
She don't care 'bout what's in style
She just likes the way he smiles
It takes more than marble and tile
Livin' on love

[Chorus]
Livin' on love, buyin' on time
Without somebody nothing ain't worth a dime
Just like an old fashion story book rhyme
Livin' on love
It sounds simple, that's what you're thinkin'
But love can walk through fire without blinkin'
It doesn't take much when you get enough
Livin' on love

[Verse 2]
Two old people without a thing
Children gone but still they sing
Side by side in that front porch swing
Livin' on love
He can't see anymore
She can barely sweep the floor
Hand in hand they'll walk through that door
Just livin' on love

[Chorus]
Livin' on love, buyin' on time
Without somebody nothing ain't worth a dime
Just like an old fashion story book rhyme
Livin' on love
It sounds simple that's what you're thinkin'
But love can walk through fire without blinkin'
It doesn't take much when you get enough
Livin' on love

[Chorus]
Livin' on love, buyin' on time
Without somebody nothing ain't worth a dime
Just like an old fashion story book rhyme
Livin' on love
But, it sounds simple that's what you're thinkin'
But love can walk through fire without blinkin'
It doesn't take much when you get enough
Livin' on love

[Outro]
No it doesn't take much when you get enough
Livin' on love"
Alan Jackson,Amazing Grace,"[Chorus]
Amazing grace! How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found;
Was blind, but now I see

[Verse]
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed
Through many dangers, toils, and snares
I have already come;
'tis grace hath brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home
When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we first begun

[Chorus]
Amazing grace! How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found;
Was blind, but now I see"
Alan Jackson,Chasin’ That Neon Rainbow,"[Verse 1]
Daddy won a radio, he tuned it to a country show
I was rocking in the cradle to the crying of a steel guitar
Mama used to sing to me, she taught me that sweet harmony
Now she worries 'cause she never thought I'd ever really take it this far
Singing in the bars

[Chorus]
And chasing that neon rainbow, living that honky-tonk dream
'Cause all I've ever wanted is to pick this guitar and sing
Just trying to be somebody, just wanna be heard and seen
I'm chasing that neon rainbow, living that honky-tonk dream

[Verse 2]
An atlas and a coffee cup, five pickers in an old Dodge truck
Heading down to Houston for a show on Saturday night
This overhead is killing me, half the time I sing for free
When the crowd's into it, lord, it makes this thing I'm doing seem right
Standing in the spotlight

[Chorus]
And chasing that neon rainbow, I'm-a living that honky-tonk dream
'Cause all I've ever wanted is to pick this guitar and sing
Just trying to be somebody, just wanna be heard and seen
I'm chasing that neon rainbow, living that honky-tonk dream

[Verse 3]
Daddy's got a radio, he won it thirty years ago
He said, ""Son, I just know we're going to hear you singing on it someday""
I made it up to Music Row, but lordy, don't the wheels turn slow
Still I wouldn't trade a minute and I wouldn't have it any other way
Just show me to the stage

[Chorus]
I'm chasing that neon rainbow, I'm-a living that honky-tonk dream
'Cause all I've ever wanted is to pick this guitar and sing
Just trying to be somebody, just wanna be heard and seen
I'm chasing that neon rainbow, living that honky-tonk dream

[Outro]
Oh, I'm chasing that neon rainbow, living that honky-tonk dream"
Alan Jackson,Like Red On A Rose,"[Verse]
Like red on a rose
When your lips first smiled at me
I was captured instantly
To each his own
Like blue in the sky
The gaze of your willing eyes
Touched something deep inside
And the truth be known

[Chorus]
That I love you
Like all little children love pennies
And I love you because I know that
I can't do anything wrong
You're where I belong
Like red on a rose

[Chorus]
And I love you
Like all little children love pennies
And I love you
Like good times of which
I've known many
And I love you
Because I know you give me
A heart of my own
You make my blood flow
Like red on a rose"
Alan Jackson,Gone Country,"[Verse 1]
She's been playing in a room on the strip
For ten years in Vegas
Every night she looks in the mirror
And she only ages

[Bridge]
She's been readin' about Nashville, and all the records
That everybody's buyin'
Says, I'm a simple girl myself
Grew up on Long Island

[Pre-Chorus]
So she packs her bags to try her hand
Says this might be my last chance

[Chorus]
She's gone country
Look at them boots
She's gone country
Back to her roots
She's gone country
A new kind of suit
She's gone country
Here she comes

[Verse 2]
Well the folk scene's dead
But he's holding out in the Village
He's been writin' songs, speakin' out against
Wealth and privilege

[Bridge]
He says, I don't believe in money
But a man could make him a killin'
Cause some of that stuff don't sound
Much different than Dylan

[Pre-Chorus]
I hear down there
It's changed, you see
Well, they're not as backward
As they used to be

[Chorus]
He's gone country
Look at them boots
He's gone country
Lack to his roots
He's gone country
A new kind of suit
He's gone country
Here he comes

[Verse 3]
Well, he commutes to L.A
But he's got a house in the Valley
But the bills are pilin' up
And the pop scene just ain't on the rally

[Bridge]
And he says, honey, I'm a serious composer
Schooled in voice and composition
But with the crime and the smog these days
This ain't no place for children

[Pre-Chorus]
Lord, it sounds so easy
This shouldn't take long
Be back in the money
In no time at all

[Chorus]
He's gone country
Look at them boots
He's gone country
Back to his roots
He's gone country
A new kind of suit
He's gone country
Here he comes

[Chorus 2]
Yeah, he's gone country
A new kind of walk
He's gone country
A new kind of talk
He's gone country
Look at them boots
He's gone country
Oh, back to his roots

[Outro]
He's gone country
He's gone country
Everybody's gone country
Yeah, we've gone county
The whole world's gone country
We're gone

Songwriter:  Bob McDill"
Alan Jackson,Don’t Rock the Jukebox,"[Chorus]
Don't rock the jukebox
I wanna hear some Jones
'Cause my heart ain't ready
For the Rolling Stones
I don't feel like rocking
Since my baby's gone
So don't rock the jukebox
Play me a country song

[Verse 1]
Before you drop that quarter
Keep one thing in mind
You got a heart-broke hillbilly
Standing here in line
I've been down and lonely
Ever since she left
Before you punch that number
Could I make one request

[Chorus]
Don't rock the jukebox
I wanna hear some Jones
'Cause my heart ain't ready
For the Rolling Stones
I don't feel like rocking
Since my baby's gone
So don't rock the jukebox
Play me a country song

[Verse 2]
I ain't got nothing
Against rock and roll
But when your heart's been broken
You need a song that's slow
Ain't nothing like a steel guitar
To drown a memory
Before you spend your money baby
Play a song for me

[Chorus]
Don't rock the jukebox
I wanna hear George Jones
'Cause my heart ain't ready
For the Rolling Stones
I don't feel like rocking
Since my baby's gone
So don't rock the jukebox
Play me a country song

[Outro]
Yeah, don't rock the jukebox
Play me a country song"
Alan Jackson,Let It Be Christmas,"[Verse 1]
Let it be Christmas everywhere
In the hearts of all people
Both near and afar
Christmas everywhere
Feel the love of the season where ever you are
On the small country roads
Lined with green mistletoe
Big city streets where a thousand lights glow

[Chorus]
Let it be Christmas everywhere
Let heavenly music fill the air
Let every heart sing
Let every bell ring
The story of hope and joy and peace
And let it be Christmas everywhere
Let heavenly music fill the air
Let anger and fear and hate disappear
Let there be love that lasts through the year
And let it be Christmas, Christmas everywhere

[Verse 2]
Let it be Christmas everywhere
With the gold and the silver, the green and the red
Christmas everywhere
In the smiles of all children asleep in their beds
In the eyes of young babies
Their first fallen snow
The elderly's memories that never grow old

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Let it be Christmas everywhere
In the songs that we sing
And the gifts that we bring
Christmas everywhere
In what this day means
And what we believe
From the sandy white beaches
Where blue water rolls
Snow covered mountains and valleys below

[Chorus]

[Outro][2x]
Christmas everywhere"
Alan Jackson,I’ll Fly Away,"[Verse 1]
Some glad morning when this life is o'er
I'll fly away
To a home on God's celestial shore
I'll fly away

[Chorus]
I'll fly away, Oh Glory
I'll fly away
When I die, Hallelujah, by and by
I'll fly away

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Just a few more weary days and then
I'll fly away
To a land where joy shall never end
I'll fly away

[Chorus]
I'll fly away, Oh Glory
I'll fly away
When I die, Hallelujah, by and by
I'll fly away

[Outro]
Yeah, when I die, Hallelujah, by and by
I'll
Fly
Away"
Kenny Rogers,The Gambler,"[Verse 1]
On a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere
I met up with a gambler, we were both too tired to sleep
So we took turns a-starin' out the window at the darkness
'Til boredom overtook us and he began to speak

[Verse 2]
He said, ""Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces
And knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes
So if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces
For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice""

[Verse 3]
So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light
And the night got deathly quiet and his face lost all expression
Said, ""If you're gonna play the game, boy, you gotta learn to play it right""

[Chorus]
You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done

[Verse 4]
Every gambler knows that the secret to survivin'
Is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep
'Cause every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser
And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep

[Verse 5]
And when he finished speakin', he turned back toward the window
Crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep
And somewhere in the darkness, the gambler, he broke even
But in his final words, I found an ace that I could keep

[Chorus]
You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done

[Outro]
You got to know when to hold 'em (When to hold 'em)
Know when to fold 'em (When to fold 'em)
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done
You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done"
Kenny Rogers,Through the Years,"[Verse 1]
I can't remember when you weren't there
When I didn't care for anyone but you
I swear we've been through everything there is
Can't imagine anything we've missed
Can't imagine anything the two of us can't do

[Chorus]
Through the years, you've never let me down
You've turned my life around
The sweetest days I've found, I've found with you
Through the years, I've never been afraid
I've loved the life we've made and I'm so glad I've stayed
Right here with you through the years

[Verse 2]
I can't remember what I used to do
Who I trusted, whom I listened to before
I swear you've taught me everything I know
Can't imagine needing someone so
But through the years it seems to me
I need you more and more

[Chorus]
Through the years, through all the good and bad
I knew how much we had
I've always been so glad to be with you
Through the years, it's better every day
You've kissed my tears away as long as it's okay
I'll stay with you through the years
Through the years, when everything went wrong
Together we were strong
I know that I belonged right here with you
Through the years, I never had a doubt
We'd always work things out, I've learned what love's about
By loving you through the years

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Through the years, you've never let me down
You've turned my life around
The sweetest days I've found, I've found with you
Through the years, it's better every day
You've kissed my tears away as long as it's okay
I'll stay with you through the years"
Kenny Rogers,Coward of the County,"[Verse 1]
Everyone considered him the coward of the county
He'd never stood one single time to prove the county wrong
His mama named him Tommy, but folks just called him yellow
Something always told me they were reading Tommy wrong

[Verse 2]
He was only ten years old when his daddy died in prison
I looked after Tommy 'cause he was my brother's son
I still recall the final words my brother said to Tommy
""Son, my life is over, but yours has just begun""

[Chorus]
Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
Now it don't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you don't have to fight to be a man

[Verse 3]
There's someone for everyone, and Tommy's love was Becky
In her arms he didn't have to prove he was a man
One day while he was working, the Gatlin boys came calling
They took turns at Becky, n'there was three of them
Tommy opened up the door and saw his Becky crying
The torn dress, the shattered look was more than he could stand
He reached above the fireplace, took down his daddy's picture
As a tear fell on his daddy's face, he heard these words again

[Chorus]
Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
Now it won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you don't have to fight to be a man

[Verse 4]
The Gatlin boys just laughed at him
When he walked into the barroom
One of them got up and met him half way cross the floor
Tommy turned around they said, ""Hey look, old yella's leavin'""
But you could've heard a pin drop
When Tommy stopped and locked the door
Twenty years of crawling was bottled up inside him
He wasn't holding nothing back, he let 'em have it all
When Tommy left the bar room, not a Gatlin boy was standing
He said, ""This one's for Becky"" as he watched the last one fall
N' I heard him say

[Chorus 2]
I promised you, Dad, not to do the things you've done
I walk away from trouble when I can
Now please don't think I'm weak, I didn't turn the other cheek
And Papa, I sure hope you understand
Sometimes you gotta fight when you're a man

[Outro]
Everyone considered him the coward of the county"
Kenny Rogers,Lady,"[Verse 1]
Lady
I'm your knight in shining armor
And I love you
You have made me what I am and I am yours
My love
There's so many ways I want to say
I love you
Let me hold you in my arms forever more

[Chorus]
You have gone
And made me such a fool
I'm so lost in your love
And oh
We belong together
Won't you believe in my song

[Verse 2]
Lady
For so many years I thought
I'd never find you
You have come into my life and made me whole
Forever
Let me wake to see you each
And every morning
Let me hear you whisper softly in my ear

[Chorus]
In my eyes
I see no one else but you
There's no other love like our love
And yes
Oh yes, I'll always want you near me
I've waited for you for so long

[Verse 3]
Lady
Your love's the only love I need
And beside me
Is where I want you to be
'Cause my love
There's something I want you to know
You're the love of my life
You're my lady"
Kenny Rogers,Lucille,"[Verse 1]
In a bar in Toledo, across from the depot
On a bar stool she took off her ring
I thought I'd get closer, so I walked on over
I sat down and asked her her name
When the drinks finally hit her, she said ""I'm no quitter
But I finally quit living on dreams
I'm hungry for laughter and here ever after
I'm after whatever the other life brings""

[Verse 2]
In the mirror I saw him, and I closely watched him
I thought how he looked out of place
He came to the woman, who sat there beside me
He had a strange look on his face
The big hands were calloused, he looked like a mountain
For a minute I thought I was dead
But he started shaking his big heart was breaking
He turned to the woman and said

[Chorus]
""You picked a fine time to leave me Lucille
With four hungry children and a crop in the field
I've had some bad times, lived through some sad times
But this time your hurting won't heal
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille""

[Verse 3]
After he left us I ordered more whiskey
I thought how she'd made him look small
From the lights of the bar room to a rented hotel room
We walked without talking at all
She was a beauty, but when she came to me
She must have thought I'd lost my mind
I couldn't hold her, 'cause the words that he told her
Kept coming back time after time

[Chorus]
You picked a fine time to leave me Lucille
With four hungry children and a crop in the field
I've had some bad times, lived through some sad times
But this time your hurting won't heal
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille"
Kenny Rogers,Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In),"[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, oh-yeah, what condition my condition was in

[Verse 1]
I woke up this mornin' with the sundown shinin' in
I found my mind in a brown paper bag within
I tripped on a cloud and fell-a eight miles high
I tore my mind on a jagged sky
I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, oh-yeah, what condition my condition was in

[Verse 2]
I pushed my soul in a deep dark hole and then I followed it in
I watched myself crawlin' out as I was a-crawlin' in
I got up so tight I couldn't unwind
I saw so much I broke my mind
I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in

[Chorus]
(Yeah, yeah, oh-yeah, what condition my condition was in)

[Verse 3]
Someone painted April fool in big black letters on a dead end sign
I had my foot on the gas as I left the road and blew out my mind
Eight miles outta Memphis and I got no spare
Eight miles straight up downtown somewhere
I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in
I said  I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in
Yeah, yeah, oh-yeah"
Kenny Rogers,Goodbye,"[Verse 1]
I wanted you for life, you and me in the wind
I never thought there'd come a time that our story would end
It's hard to understand, but I guess I'll have to try
It's not easy to say goodbye

[Verse 2]
For all the joy we share, all that time we had to spend
Now if I had one wish, I'd want forever back again
To look into your eyes and hold you when you cry
It's not easy to say goodbye

[Chorus]
I remember all those great time we had
So many memories, some good, some bad
Yes, and through it all, those memories will last forever

[Verse 3]
There's peace in where you are, maybe all I need to know
And if I listen to my heart, I'll hear your laughter once more
And so I have to say I'm just glad you came my way
It's not easy to say goodbye

[Outro]
Goodbye"
Kenny Rogers,She Believes in Me,"[Verse 1]
While she lays sleeping, I stay out late at night and play my songs
And sometimes all the nights can be so long
And it's good when I finally make it home, all alone
While she lays dreaming, I try to get undressed without the light
And quietly she says, ""How was your night?""
And I come to her and say, it was all right, and I hold her tight

[Chorus]
And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows, maybe on some special night, if my song is right
I will find a way, find a way

[Verse 2]
While she lays waiting, I stumble to the kitchen for a bite
Then I see my old guitar in the night
Just waiting for me like a secret friend, and there's no end
While she lays crying, I fumble with a melody or two
And I'm torn between the things that I should do
Then she says to wake her up when I am through
God, her love is true

[Chorus]
And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right
I will find a way, while she lays, while she waits for me"
Kenny Rogers,Ruby Don’t Take Your Love to Town,"[Verse 1]
You've painted up your lips and rolled and curled your tinted hair
Ruby, are you contemplating going out somewhere?
The shadow on the wall tells me the sun is goin' down

[Refrain 1]
Oh, Ruby
Don't take your love to town

[Verse 2]
It wasn't me that started that old crazy Asian war
But I was proud to go and do my patriotic chore
And yes, it's true, that I'm not the man I used to be

[Refrain 2]
Oh, Ruby
I still need some company

[Verse 3]
It's hard to love a man whose legs are bent and paralyzed
And the wants and the needs of a woman of your age
Ruby, I realize
But it won't be long, I've heard them say, until I'm not around

[Refrain 1]
Oh, Ruby
Don't take your love to town

[Verse 3]
She's leavin' now 'cause I just heard the slammin' of the door
The way I know I've heard it slam 100 times before
And if I could move, I'd get my gun and put her in the ground

[Refrain 1]
Oh, Ruby
Don't take your love to town

[Refrain 3]
Oh, Ruby
For God sake's, turn around"
Kenny Rogers,Crazy,"[Verse 1]
Girl, there are no words to say
What I feel in my heart
You, you're on my mind night and day
And it hurts me when we're apart
When you're not here by my side
There is nothing in this world for me

[Chorus]
I guess I'm crazy, crazy for you, can't you see?
And although you may think it's crazy
Here is where I want to be
I will always need your love

[Verse 2]
Well now, I can see every dream
When I look in your eyes
And though, things never are what they seem
There is one thing that I realize
That there's no doubt in my mind
We can make this love go on forever

[Chorus]
I guess I'm crazy, crazy for you, can't you see?
And although you may think I'm crazy
Here is where I'll always be
And I need you with me

[Outro]
'Cause you are the dream
That finally came true for me
And all my life there'll be no one else
If I looked all my life, there could be no one else
And for the rest of my life all I need is you"
Kenny Rogers,Daytime Friends,"[Verse 1]
And he'll tell her he's working late again
But she knows too well there's something going on
She's been neglected, and she needs a friend
So her trembling fingers dial the telephone

[Verse 2]
Lord, it hurts her doing this again
He's the best friend that her husband ever knew
When she's lonely, he's more than just a friend
He's the one she longs to give her body to

[Chorus]
Daytime friends and nighttime lovers
Hoping no one else discovers
Where they go, what they do, in their secret hideaway
Daytime friends and nighttime lovers
They don't want to hurt the others
So they love in the nighttime
And shake hands in the light of day

[Verse 3]
When it's over, there's no peace of mind
Just a longing for the way things should have been
And she wonders why some men never find
That a woman needs a lover and a friend

[Chorus]
Daytime friends and nighttime lovers
Hoping no one else discovers
Where they go, what they do, in their secret hideaway
Daytime friends and nighttime lovers
They don't want to hurt the others
So they love in the nighttime
And shake hands in the light of day

[Chorus]
Daytime friends and nighttime lovers
Hoping no one else discovers
Where they go, what they do, in their secret hideaway
Daytime friends and nighttime lovers
They don't want to hurt the others
So they love in the nighttime
And shake hands in the light of day

Daytime friends and nighttime lovers
Hoping no one else discovers
Where they go, what they do, in their secret hideaway
Daytime friends and nighttime lovers
They don't want to hurt the others
So they love in the nighttime
And shake hands in the light of day"
Kenny Rogers,You Decorated My Life,"[Verse 1]
All my life was a paper once plain, pure and white
Till you moved with your pen changing moods now and then
Till the balance was right
Then you added some music, every note was in place
And anybody could see all the changes in me by the look on my face

[Chorus]
And you decorated my life, created a world where dreams are a part
And you decorated my life by painting your love all over my heart
You decorated my life

[Verse 2]
Like a rhyme with no reason
In an unfinished song
There was no harmony, life meant nothin' to me, until you came along
And you brought out the colors
What a gentle surprise
Now I'm able to see, all the things life can be, shining soft in your eyes

[Chorus Outro]
And you decorated my life, created a world where dreams are a part
And you decorated my life by painting your love all over my heart
You decorated my life"
Kenny Rogers,If I Ever Fall in Love Again,"[Verse 1: Kenny Rogers]
You, I know you're everything
That I've been looking for
And I, I look into your eyes
And could not ask for more

[Pre-Chorus: Anne Murray]
So it's only fair to lay it on the line
Hold on, I'm gonna need a little time

[Chorus: Kenny Rogers, Anne Murray, Both]
But if I ever fall in love again
Sometimes when this broken heart can mend
I know it's gonna be with you (it's gonna be with you)
You're the one to pull me through
Though I don't know when
If I ever fall in love again

[Verse 2: Anne Murray]
Scared, I guess I'm scared to fly
It's such a long way down
And yet, if you'd just trust in me
I'm sure, I'd come around

[Pre-Chorus: Kenny Rogers, Anne Murray, Both]
And I know when you're hurt
It's hard to let someone inside (oh, woh)
In your arms I feel I'm ready now to try
Ohh wooh

[Chorus: Kenny Rogers, Anne Murray, Both]
So if I ever fall in love again
Sometimes when this broken heart can mend
I know it's gonna be with you (it's gonna be with you)
You're the one to pull me through
Though I don't know when
If I ever fall in love again

[Bridge: Anne Murray with Kenny Rogers]
I'd be a fool to ever let you go
You're the best thing in my life
When I know I gotta take it slow

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus: Kenny Rogers, Anne Murray, Both]
Oh, I know it's gonna be with you (it's gonna be with you)
You're the one to pull me through
Though I don't know when
If I ever fall in love again

[Outro: Kenny Rogers & Anne Murray]
If I ever fall in love again"

Kenny Rogers,Don’t Fall in Love with a Dreamer,"[Verse 1]
Just look at you sitting there
You never looked better than tonight
And it would be so easy to tell you I'd stay
Like I've done so many times

[Verse 2]
I was so sure that this would be the night
You'd close the door and wanna stay with me
And it'd be so easy to tell you I'd wait
Like I've done so many times

[Chorus]
Don't fall in love with a dreamer
'Cause he'll always take you in
Just when you think you've really changed him
He'll leave you again
Don't you fall in love with a dreamer
'Cause he'll break you every time
Put out the light and just hold on
Before we say goodbye

[Verse 3]
Now it's morning, the phone rings
And you say you've gotta get your things together
You just gotta leave before you change your mind
And if you knew what I was thinking girl
I'd turn around if you'd just ask me one more time

[Chorus]
Don't fall in love with a dreamer
'Cause he'll always take you in
Just when you think you've really changed him
He'll leave you again
Don't fall in love with a dreamer
'Cause he'll break you every time
Put out the light and just hold on
Before we say goodbye
Before we said goodbye
Goodbye"
Kenny Rogers,You And I,"All the man I am
You are the reason for me, you help me understand
I'll be your shelter from the rain that never ends
Girl, you've always got a friend in me

All the love we had
I should've known our love was older than the past
Throwing my life away on songs I never heard
Just the speaking of a special word
I made you die inside but you loved me

And don't believe the world
No, the world can't give us paradise
When you make your love to me
Til I just could not see the light

As long as I got you
As long as you got me
As long as we got you and I

I won't let you down
No better love will be there when you turn around
I'll be living for you till the ocean turns to sand
There will never be any man
Could love you just the way that I love you....

So don't believe the world
No the world can't give us paradise
In the eye within the storm
When I just could not make it through the night

As long as I got you
As long as you got me
As long as we got you and I

So don't believe the world
No the world can't give us paradise
In the eye within the storm
When I just could not make it through the night

As long as I got you
As long as you got me
As long as we got you and I"
Kenny Rogers,Reuben James,"[Verse 1]
Reuben James, in my song you live again
And the phrases that I rhyme are just a footstep out of time
From the time when I knew you, Reuben James

[Verse 2]
Reuben James, all the folks around Madison County
Cussed your name
You're just a no-count, sharecropping colored man
Who'd steal anything you can
And everybody laid the blame on Reuben James

[Chorus]
Reuben James, for you still walk over fields of my mind
Faded shirt, weathered brow, calloused hands upon the plow
Loved you then and I love you now, Reuben James

[Verse 3]
For a grave, the gossiper of Madison County died with child
Although your skin was black
You were the one that didn't turn your back
On the hungry white child with no name, Reuben James

[Verse 4]
Reuben James, with your mind on the soul
And a Bible in your right hand
You said turn the other cheek
For there's a better world awaiting for the meek
In my mind, these words remain from Reuben James

[Chorus]
Reuben James, for you still walk over fields of my mind
Faded shirt, weathered brow, calloused hands upon the plow
Loved you then and I love you now, Reuben James

[Bridge]
Reuben James, one dark cloudy day
They brought you from the field
And to your lonely pine box
Came just a preacher, me and the rain
Just to sing one last refrain to Reuben James

[Chorus]
Reuben James, for you still walk over fields of my mind
Faded shirt, weathered brow, calloused hands upon the plow
Loved you then and I love you now, Reuben James
Reuben James, for you still walk over fields of my mind
Faded shirt, weathered brow, calloused hands upon the plow
Loved you then and I love you now, Reuben James"
Kenny Rogers,The Greatest,"[Verse 1]
Little boy in a baseball hat
Stands in the feild with his ball and bat
Says, I am the greatest player of them all
Put his bat on his shoulder and he tosses up the ball

[Chorus]
And the ball goes up and the ball comes down
Swings his bat all the way around
The worlds so still he can hear the sound
The baseball falls to the ground

[Verse 2]
Now the little boy doesn't say a word
Picks up his ball, he is undeterred
Says, I am the greatest there has ever been
And he grits his teeth and he tries it again

[Chorus]
And the ball goes up and the ball comes down
Swings his bat all the way around
The worlds so still he can hear the sound
The baseball falls to the ground

[Bridge]
He makes no excuses
He shows no fear
He just closes his eyes
And listens to the cheers

[Verse 3]
Little boy, he adjusts his hat
Picks up his ball, stares at his bat
Says, I am the greatest, the game is on the line
And he gives his all one last time

[Chorus]
And the ball goes up when the moons so bright
Swings his bat with all his might
And the worlds so still as still can be
And the baseball falls and thats strike three

[Verse 4]
Now it's suppertime and his mama calls
Little boy starts home with his bat and ball
Says, I am the greatest that is a fact
But even I didn't know I could pitch like that!

[Outro]
Says, I am the greatest
That is understood
But even I didn't know
I could pitch that good...."
Kenny Rogers,If You Want to Find Love,"He was sitting on a bar stool
A picture from a cheating song
She'd been standing by the jukebox
Dropping quarters all night long

He said, tell me: are you lonely?
Is there some place we can go?
She said: cowboy, you know I'm lonely
But there's something you should know

If you wanna find gold go looking in the mountains
If you wanna find silver go digging in stones
If you wanna find heaven go reading in the Bible
If you wanna find love go looking at home

She touched the gold ring on his finger
And held it to the jukebox light
And she said. Stranger, think what you're losing
If you leave here with me tonight

So he hold her body closer
She felt feelings she'd never known
And he said: thank you, for the lesson
And if you need me I'll be at home

If you wanna find gold go looking in the mountains
If you wanna find silver go digging in stones
If you wanna find heaven go reading in the Bible
If you wanna find love go looking at home..."
Kenny Rogers,Buy Me a Rose,"He works hard to give her all he thinks she wants
A three car garage, her own credit cards
He pulls in late to wake her up with a kiss good night
If he could only read her mind, she'd say

[Chorus]
Buy me a rose, call me from work
Open a door for me, what would it hurt
Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
These are the little things I need the most in my life

Now the days have grown to years of feeling all alone
And she can't help but wonder what she's doing wrong
Cause lately she'd try anything to turn his head
Would it make a difference if she said:

[Chorus]

And the more that he lives the less that he tries
To show her the love that he holds inside
And the more that she gives the more that he sees
This is a story of you and me

So I bought you a rose on the way home from work
To open the door to a heart that I hurt
And I hope you notice this look in my eyes
Cause I'm gonna make things right
For the rest of your life
I'm gonna hold you tonight
Do all those little things
For the rest of your life"
Kenny Rogers,I Will Always Love You,"[Verse 1]
I saw you tonight
In the room where love had started once before
And we open up the skies with your loving eyes
You take me back where you belong in my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
(One love frozen in time)
(Never be a bad love, yours and mine)
But I still remain
And I will never change

[Chorus]
I will always love you
I will always take your part
And all the years of losing you and then
Being close to you again
The very chance that I could take your heart
Your hand in mine
(You are inside of me)
One more time
(Don't you remember me?)

[Post-Chorus]
And the days that lie ahead, they all go wrong

[Verse 2]
But tonight, my love
There's no question in my mind where we should be
And it's clear that you're alone and I'm alone
And all the fools have gone
You open up so tears can fall from your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
(True love can never die)
(We can make it one day if we try)
Be there sunshine or rain
And I will never change

[Chorus]
I will always love you
I will always take your part
And all the years of losing you and then
Making love to you again
The very chance that I could take your heart
Your hand in mine
(I got a memory)
For all time
(Don't you remember me?)

[Bridge]
Now my dream will come true if you love me

[Chorus]
I will always love you
And I will always take your part
And all the years of losing you and then
Making love to you again
The very chance that I could take your heart
Your hand in mine

[Outro]
I will always love you
And I will always take your part
And all the years of losing you and then
Making love to you again
The very chance that I could take your heart
Your hand in mine"
Kenny Rogers,Write Your Name (Across My Heart),"I can't help smiling when I look at you
To keep from going crazy is all I can do
I'm so defenseless with you so close
The walls have crumbled from my body and soul

Write your name across my heart
I want the world to know that I am yours forever
And I will wear it like a shining star
Write your name across my heart

To you, my life is an open door
Everything I have is yours
I'll try to give you everything you need
But as far as love goes, there's a lifetime guarantee

Write your name across my heart
I want the world to know that I am yours forever
And I will wear it like a shining star
Write your name across my heart

In all my thoughts, in all I do, in all I say
I belong to you with every breath I take...

Write your name across my heart
I want the world to know that I am yours forever
And I will wear it like a shining star
Write your name, across my heart

And I will wear it like a shining star
Write your name across my heart
Across my heart
Across my heart"
Kenny Rogers,The Greatest Gift Of All,"Dawn is slowly breaking
Our friends have all gone home
You and I are waiting
For Santa Clause to come
There's a present by the tree
Stockings on the wall
And knowing you're in love with me
Is the greatest gift of all
The fire is slowly fading
Chill is in the air
All the gifts are waiting
For children everywhere
Throught the window I can see
Snow begin to fall
Knowing you're in love with me
Is the greatest gift of all
Just before I go to sleep
I hear a church bell ring
Merry Christmas everyone
Is the song it sings
So I say a silent prayer
For creatures great and small
Peace on Earth, good will to men
Is the greatest gift of all
Peace on Earth, good will to men
Is the greatest gift of all"
Kenny Rogers,Love Will Turn You Around,"You can run, you can hide
Never let it inside
Keep living your life in the dark
Sooner or later
That gentle persuader is gonna catch up with your heart
Make you a dreamer
Believer
Believing in love

Right when a man's doing all that he planned
And he thinks he's got just what he needs
Life will deliver a shot that will shiver him
Driving him down to his knees
Make him start giving
Living
Living again

Well, it's your mind
That tricks you into leaving everytime
Love will turn you around, turn you around
Well, it's your heart
That talks you into staying where you are
Love will turn you around
Turn you around

Out of the blue
She reaches for you
And you tell her you don't have the time
So you move away fast
But you know it won't last
Cause you can't get her off of your mind
Thoughts are burning
Turning
They're turning around

How do you know when to stay or to go
And how do you know when it's real
You don't need a sign to make up your mind
You got your heart at the wheel

You wanna start sharing
Caring
Caring again

Well, it's your mind
That tricks you into leaving everytime
Love will turn you around
Turn you around
Well, it's your heart
That talks you into staying where you are
Love will turn you around
Turn you around

Love will turn you around
Turn you around
Love will turn you around
Turn you around
Turn you around"
Kenny Rogers,Love the World Away,"[Verse 1]
Every now and then when the world steps in
Stealin' all our time away
It soon takes so much
We forget to touch
That's when I know it's time for me to say

[Chorus]
Take my hand
Let's walk through love's door
And be free from the world once more
Here's my arms
We can hide today
And love the world away

[Verse 2]
Once again we'll be where our hearts are free
And the time is ours to share
Love will always stay just a touch away
Come with me
All the magic's waiting there

[Chorus]
Take my hand
Let's walk through love's door
And be free from the world once more
Here's my arms
We can hide today
And love the world away

We can love the world away"

Shania Twain,That Don’t Impress Me Much,"[Intro]
Ow
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I've known a few guys who thought they were pretty smart
But you've got being right down to an art
You think you're a genius, you drive me up the wall
You're a regular original, a know-it-all

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh, you think you're special
Oh-oh, you think you're something else
Okay, so you're a rocket scientist

[Chorus]
That don't impress me much
So you got the brains, but have you got the touch?
Now, don't get me wrong—yeah, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night
That don't impress me much
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
I never knew a guy who carried a mirror in his pocket
And a comb up his sleeve—just in case
And all that extra hold gel in your hair oughta lock it
’Cause heaven forbid it should fall outta place

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh, you think you're special
Oh-oh, you think you're something else
Okay, so you're Brad Pitt

[Chorus]
That don't impress me much (Oh, oh, ooh)
So you got the looks, but have you got the touch?
Now, don't get me wrong—yeah, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night
That don't impress me much
Yeah

[Verse 3]
You're one of those guys who likes to shine his machine
You make me take off my shoes before you let me get in
I can't believe you kiss your car good night
Now, come on, baby, tell me, you must be joking, right?

Oh-oh, you think you're something special
Oh-oh, you think you're something else

So you got the moves, but have you got the touch?
Now, don't get me wrong—yeah, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night
That don't impress me much (That don't impress me)
Oh, oh no, you think you're cool, but have you got the touch?
Now, now, don't get me wrong—yeah, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm on the long, cold, lonely night
That don't impress me much
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah

Okay, so what do you think, you're Elvis or something?
Whatever
That don't impress me"
Shania Twain,From This Moment On,"[Intro: Shania Twain]

Through weakness and strength, happiness and sorrow
For better for worse, I will love you
With every beat of my heart

Shania Twain,"Honey, I’m Home","[Verse 1]
The car won't start, it's falling apart
I was late for work and the boss got smart
My pantyline shows, got a run in my hose
My hair went flat, man, I hate that (Hate that)
Oh, just when I thought things couldn't get worse
I realized I forgot my purse
With all this stress, I must confess
This could be worse than PMS
[Pre-Chorus]
This job ain't worth the pay
Can't wait until the end of the day
Hey honey, I'm on my way
Hey (Hey)
Hey (Hey)
Hey
[Chorus]
Honey, I'm home and I had a hard day
Pour me a cold one and oh, by the way
Rub my feet, give me something to eat
Fix me up my favorite treat
Honey, I'm back, my neck's killing me
I need to relax and watch TV
Get off the phone, give the dog a bone
Hey (Hey)
Hey
Honey, I'm home

[Verse 2]
I broke a nail opening the mail
I cursed out loud 'cause it hurt like hell
This job's a pain; it's so mundane
It sure don't stimulate my brain

Can't wait until the end of the day
Hey honey, I'm on my way

Shania Twain,Any Man of Mine,"[Intro]
This is what a woman wants

[Verse 1]
Any man of mine better be proud of me
Even when I'm ugly, he still better love me
And I can be late for a date—that's fine
But he'd better be on time
Any man of mine'll say it fits just right
When last year's dress is just a little too tight
And anything I do or say better be okay
When I have a bad hair day

[Pre-Chorus]
And if I change my mind
A million times
I wanna hear him say
""Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I like it that way!""

[Chorus]
Any man of mine better walk the line
Better show me a teasin', squeezin', pleasin', kinda time
I need a man who knows how the story goes
He's gotta be a heartbeatin', fine treatin'
Breathtakin', earthquakin' kind
Any man of mine

[Verse 2]
Well, any man of mine better disagree
When I say another woman's looking better than me
And when I cook him dinner and I burn it black
He'd better say, ""Mmm, I like it like that, yeah""

[Pre-Chorus]
And if I change my mind
A million times
I wanna hear him say
""Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I like it that way!""

[Chorus]
Any man of mine better walk the line
Better show me a teasin', squeezin', pleasin', kinda time
I need a man who knows how the story goes
He's gotta be a heartbeatin', fine treatin'
Breathtakin', earthquakin' kind
Any man of mine

Let me hear you say
""Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I like it that way!""

Any man of mine better walk the line
Better show me a teasin', squeezin', pleasin', kinda time
I need a man who knows how the story goes
He's gotta be a heartbeatin', fine treatin'
Breathtakin', earthquakin' kind
Any man of mine

[Outro]
You gotta shimmy shake
Make the earth quake
Kick, turn, stomp, stomp, then you jump
Heel to toe, do-si-do
'Til your boots wanna break
'Til your feet and your back ache
Keep it movin' 'til you just can't take anymore
Come on everybody on the floor
A-one two, a-three four
Hup two, hup
If you wanna be a man of mine, that's right
This is what a woman wants"
Shania Twain,Life’s About to Get Good,"[Verse 1]

You no longer love me, and I sang like a sad bird
I couldn't move on, and I think you were flattered

Oh, life's about joy (Joy)

The longer my tears fell, the wider the river (Good to love you, baby)
It killed me that you'd give your life to be with her (Good to love you, baby)
I had to believe that things would get better (Better, better)
It was time to forget you, forever

Oh, life's about joy (Joy)

You are the one, I think I'm in love

Shania Twain,Ka-Ching!,"[Intro]
Mm, oh

[Verse 1]
We live in a greedy little world
That teaches every little boy and girl
To earn as much as they can possibly
Then turn around and spend it foolishly
We've created us a credit card mess
We spend the money that we don't possess
Our religion is to go and blow it all
So we're shoppin' every Sunday at the mall

[Pre-Chorus]
All we ever want is more
A lot more than we had before
So take me to the nearest store

[Chorus]
(Ka-ching!)
Can you hear it ring? (Ka-ching!)
It makes you wanna sing (Ka-ching!)
It's such a beautiful thing
Ka-ching! (Ka-ching!)
Lots of diamond rings (Ka-ching!)
The happiness it brings (Ka-ching!)
You'll live like a king
With lots of money and things

[Verse 2]
When you're broke, go and get a loan
Take out another mortgage on your home
Consolidate so you can afford
To go and spend some more when you get bored

[Pre-Chorus]
All we ever want is more
A lot more than we had before
So take me to the nearest store

[Chorus]
(Ka-ching!)
Can you hear it ring? (Ka-ching!)
It makes you wanna sing (Ka-ching!)
It's such a beautiful thing
Ka-ching! (Ka-ching!)
Lots of diamond rings (Ka-ching!)
The happiness it brings (Ka-ching!)
You'll live like a king
With lots of money and things
Let's swing

[Bridge]
Dig deeper in your pocket
Ooh, yeah, ah
Come on, I know you've got it
Dig deeper in your wallet
Whoa

[Pre-Chorus]
All we ever want is more
A lot more than we had before
So take me to the nearest store

[Chorus]
(Ka-ching!)
Can you hear it ring? (Ka-ching!)
It makes you wanna sing (Ka-ching!)
It's such a beautiful thing
Ka-ching! (Ka-ching!)
Lots of diamond rings (Ka-ching!)
The happiness it brings (Ka-ching!)
You'll live like a king
With lots of money and things (Ka-ching!)
Can you hear it ring? (Ka-ching!)
It makes you wanna sing (Ka-ching!)
You'll live like a king
With lots of money and things

Shania Twain,Giddy Up!,"[Verse 1]
I left my heart at a waterin' hole
Somewhere in small-town Ohio
Headed out west to Arizona

Easy come, easy go
I got a fast car with the '90s on
Not a soul on the road, but the road is home

Smiles for miles
All up on my face (My face)
Wear it, share it
'Cause we ain't got time to waste (Get to it)

Drunk in the city, got litty in the cup
Up in your giddy up

Time to make it happеn 'cause it feels so good
Singin' in the mirror like it's Hollywood

Shania Twain,Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under?,"[Chorus]
Whose bed have your boots been under?
Whose bed have your boots been under?
And whose heart did you steal, I wonder?
This time, did it feel like thunder, baby?
But whose bed have your boots been under?

[Verse 1]
Don't look so lonely
Don't act so blue
I know I'm not the only
Girl you run to
I know about Lolita
Your little Spanish flame
I've seen you around with Rita
The redhead down the lane

[Chorus]
Whose bed have your boots been under?
And whose heart did you steal, I wonder?
This time, did it feel like thunder, baby?
And who did you run to?
And whose lips have you been kissing?
And whose ear did you make a wish in?
Is she the one that you've been missing, baby?
Well, whose bed have your boots been under?

[Verse 2]
I heard you've been sneaking
Around with Jill
And what about that weekend
With Beverly Hill
And I've seen you walking
With long-legs Louise
And you weren't just talking
Last night with Denise

[Chorus]
Whose bed have your boots been under?
And whose heart did you steal, I wonder?
This time, did it feel like thunder, baby?
And who did you run to?
And whose lips have you been kissing?
And whose ear did you make a wish in?
Is she the one that you've been missing, baby?
Well, whose bed have your boots been under?

[Verse 3]
Come on, boots
Oh yeah (Come on)
So next time you're lonely
Don't call on me
Try the operator
Maybe she'll be free

Whose bed have your boots been under?
And whose heart did you steal, I wonder?
This time, did it feel like thunder?
Whose bed have your boots been under?
And whose heart did you steal, I wonder?
This time, did it feel like thunder, baby?
And who did you run to?
And whose lips have you been kissing?
And whose ear did you make a wish in?
Is she the one that you've been missing, baby?
Well, whose bed have your boots been under?

Shania Twain,No One Needs to Know,"[Verse 1]
Am I dreaming or stupid?
I think I've been hit by cupid
But no one needs to know right now
I met a tall, dark and handsome man
And I've been busy making big plans
But no one needs to know right now
I got my heart set, my feet wet
But he don't even know it yet
And no one needs to know right now

[Chorus]
I'll tell him someday, some way, somehow
But I'm gonna keep it a secret for now

[Verse 2]
I want bells to ring, a choir to sing
The white dress, the guests, the cake, the car, the whole darn thing
But no one needs to know right now

I'll tell him someday, some way, somehow
But I'm gonna keep it a secret for now

[Verse 3]
We'll have a little girl, a little boy
A little Benji we call Leroy
But no one needs to know right now

And I'm not lonely anymore at night
And he don't know only, only he can make it right
And I'm not lonely anymore at night
And he don't know only, only he can make it right

I'm not dreaming or stupid
But boy, have I been hit by cupid
But no one needs to know right now
No one needs to know right now
No one needs to know right now

Shania Twain,You’ve Got a Way,"[Verse 1]
You've got a way with me
Somehow you got me to believe
In everything that I could be
I've gotta say, you really got a way
You've got a way it seems
You gave me faith to find my dreams
You'll never know just what that means
Can't you see?
You've got a way with me

[Chorus]
It's in the way you want me
It's in the way you hold me
The way you show me just what love's made of
It's in the way we make love

You've got a way with words
You get me smiling even when it hurts
There's no way to measure what your love is worth
I can't believe the way you get through to me

It's in the way you want me
It's in the way you hold me
The way you show me just what love's made of
It's in the way we make love

You're so complicated
You hang over my shoulder when I read my mail
I don't appreciate it
When I talk to other guys, you think they're on my tail
I get so aggravated
When I get off the phone and get the third degree
I'm really feelin' frustrated
Why don't you take a pill and put a little trust in me?

Shania Twain,When,"[Intro]
One, two, now

If elephants could fly. I'd be a little more optimistic
But I don't see that happening anytime soon

And hear on CNN that Elvis lives again
And that John's back with the Beatles and they're going out on tour

Gotta see that show for sure

When will I wake up?
Why did we break up?

Shania Twain,I’m Alright,"[Verse 1]
You let me go
You had to have her
You told me slow

It's a mad world
But I'm not mad
I've already downed that pill

All you did was stand there
Without a sound
It came from nowhere
The truth so loud
Oh, my heart stood still

The one you wanted
I tried to scream
But silence haunted
Me in my sleep
Oh, and probably always will

Tonight
Oh, I'm alive
I think I'm gonna be okay

Tell me 'bout the good ol' days

This world's gone crazy
Grandpa
Take me back to yesterday
When the line between right and wrong
Didn't seem so hazy

Did lovers really fall in love to stay
And stand beside each other come what may?

Well, you've finally come down to your old hometown
Your Kentucky girl's been a-waiting patiently
Why not me?

[Chorus]
Why not me on a rainy day?
Why not me to love your cares away?
Why not me?
Why not me when the nights get cold?
Why not me when you're growin' old?
Why not me?

[Verse 2]
You've been searching from here to Singapore
Ain't it time that you notice the girl next door, baby?
Why not me?
You had to see if the world was round
It's time that you learned how good settlin' down could be
Why not me?

[Chorus]
Why not me on a rainy day?
Why not me to love your cares away?
Why not me?
Why not me when the nights get cold?
Why not me when you're growin' old?
Why not me?

You've been lookin' for love all around the world
Baby, don't you know this country girl's still free?
Why not me?
Why not me?
Baby, why not me?

The Judds,Beautiful Star of Bethlehem,"[Verse 1]
Oh, beautiful star of Bethlehem
Shining far through shadows dimmed
Giving the light for those who long have gone
Guiding the wise men on their way
Unto the place where Jesus lay
Oh, beautiful star of Bethlehem, shine on

[Verse 2]
Oh, beautiful star, the hope of light
Guiding the pilgrims through the night
Over the mountains 'til the break of dawn
Into the land of perfect day
It will give out a lovely ray
Oh, beautiful star of Bethlehem, shine on

Oh, beautiful star (Beautiful, beautiful star)
Of Bethlehem (Star of Bethlehem)
Shine upon us until the glory dawns
Give us a lamp to light the way
Unto the land of perfect day
Oh, beautiful star of Bethlehem, shine on

[Verse 3]
Oh, beautiful star, the hope, the grace
For the redeemed, the good and the blessed
Yonder in glory when the crowd is one
Jesus is now the star divine
Brighter and brighter he will shine
Oh, beautiful star of Bethlehem, shine on

[Chorus]
Oh, beautiful star (Beautiful, beautiful star)
Of Bethlehem (Star of Bethlehem)
Shine upon us until the glory dawns
Give us a lamp to light the way
Unto the land of perfect day

Oh, beautiful star of Bethlehem, shine on"
The Judds,"Mama, He’s Crazy","[Verse 1]
Mama, I found someone
Like you said would come along
He's a sight, and so unlike any man I've known
I was afraid to let him in
'Cause I'm not the trustin' kind
But now I'm convinced that he's heaven-sent
And must be out of his mind

[Chorus]
Mama, he's crazy
Crazy over me
And in my life is where he says
He always wants to be
I've never been so loved
He beats all I've ever seen
And, mama, he's crazy
He's crazy over me

[Verse 2]
And, mama, you've always said
""Better look before you leap""
Well, maybe so, but here I go
Lettin' my heart lead me
He thinks I hung the moon and stars
I think he's a livin' dream
Well, there are men, but ones like him
Are few and far between

[Chorus]
Mama, he's crazy
Crazy over me
And in my life is where he says
He always wants to be
I've never been so loved
He beats all I've ever seen
Mama, he's crazy
He's crazy over me, oh
And, mama, he's crazy
He's crazy over me"
The Judds,Young Love (Strong Love),"[Verse 1]
She was sittin' cross-legged on a hood of a Ford
Filin' down her nails with an emery board
Talkin' to her friends about people they knew
And all of the things that young girls do
When she said, ""You see that guy in the baseball cap?
I'd like to spend some time with a boy like that""
Betty said, ""I've seen him at the hardware store
I think his name is Billy, but I'm not sure""
And as they talked a little while, he passed by
She smiled at him, he just said, ""Hi""
He was thinking to himself as he walked away
""Man, I'd like to find a girl like her someday""

[Chorus]
Young love, strong love
True love, it's a new love
They're gonna make it through the hard times
And walk those lines
Yeah, these ties will bind
Young love

[Verse 2]
Well, she just couldn't stop herself from thinkin' 'bout him
And at a store downtown, she saw him again
She had both hands full, he held open the door
He said, ""My name is Billy, I've seen you before""
""Can I help you with these? Can I give you a ride?
Can I take you out on Saturday night?""
She didn't have to say what she was feelin' inside
He could see the answer shinin' in her eyes

[Chorus]
Young love, strong love
True love, it's a new love
They're gonna make it through the hard times
And walk those lines
Yeah, these ties will bind
Young love

[Verse 3]
Well, from that day on, you couldn't keep them apart
They were side by side and heart to heart
Mama cried as Billy slipped the ring on her hand
And when the baby was born, she was cryin' again
Well, he worked real hard and put some money down
On a little old house at the edge of town
And that night as he held her, he couldn't believe
That God had made a girl that he'd never ever leave

[Chorus]
Young love, strong love
True love, it's a new love
They're gonna make it through the hard times
And walk those lines
Yeah, these ties will bind
Young love

She was sittin' cross-legged on a hood of a Ford
Filin' down her nails with an emery board"
The Judds,Love Can Build a Bridge,"[Verse 1]

Sittin' in the porch swing listenin' to the light rain
Beatin' on the tin roof, baby, just me and you

The Judds,Love is Alive,"[Verse 1]
Love ain't a candle
It doesn't burn for one night and need the dark to shine
Love is alive
And love ain't just a word in every dictionary
With nowhere defined
Love is a man and he's mine

[Chorus]
Love is alive and at our breakfast table
Every day of the week
Love is alive and it grows every day and night
Even in our sleep
Love is alive and it's made a happy woman out of me
Oh, love is alive
And here by me

[Verse 2]
Love ain't just a mood
A distant far away dream that needs the night to rise
Love is alive
And love ain't just a song
Sweet words of music to go dancin' by
Love is a man and he's mine

[Chorus]
Love is alive and at our breakfast table
Every day of the week
Love is alive and it grows every day and night
Even in our sleep
Love is alive and it's made a happy woman out of me
Oh, love is alive
And here by me
Oh, love is alive and at our breakfast table
Every day of the week
Love is alive and it grows every day and night
Even in our sleep

And here by me

The Judds,Have Mercy,"[Verse 1]
Well, I was standin' in line at the city bus stop
Soaked to the skin from every raindrop
I see you drivin' by just like a phantom jet
With your arm around some little brunette
You say you won't be home because you're workin' late
Honey, I'm no fool, you've been out on a date
The lipstick on your collar gives your game away
It's strawberry red and mine's pink roses

[Chorus]
Have mercy on me
You treat me so bad, I'm in misery
It's breakin' my heart, can't you see?
Baby, baby, have mercy on me

[Verse 2]
Well, I called you up on the telephone
I could hear you was playin' Haggard and Jones
I knew right then that there was somethin' wrong
There's only one reason you play cheatin' songs

[Chorus]
Have mercy on me
You treat me so bad, I'm in misery
It's breakin' my heart, can't you see?
Baby, baby, have mercy on me, yeah

[Interlude]
Woo

[Verse 3]
Well, I went to the bank with my little checkbook
The cashier, he gave me the strangest look
He said, ""You ain't got no money 'cause you're overdrawn
Your man took it all and he's a, a-done gone""

[Chorus]
Have mercy on me
You treat me so bad, I'm in misery
It's breakin' my heart, can't you see?

The Judds,John Deere Tractor (1984),"[Verse 1]
Dear, mama, well, here's a letter from your girl
Well, I think my city days are done, mom
And it ain't been three weeks since I came
And mama, do remember what you said
Say your prayers before you go to bed, child
And remember, city boys ain't the same

[Chorus]
I'm like a John Deere Tractor
In a half-acre field
Tryin' to plow a furrow
Where the soil is made of steel
How I wish I was home, mom
Where the blue grass is growin'
And the sweet country boys don't complain

[Verse 2]
And, mama, so much perfume, I thought I'd drown
And the Lord didn't seem to be nowhere around
Hey, I felt just like a flower from the vine

[Chorus]
I'm like a John Deere Tractor
In a half-acre field
Tryin' to plow a furrow
Where the soil is made of steel
How I'd like to be home, mom
Where the blue grass is growing
And the fire light shimmers
And it shines
I'm like a John Deere Tractor
In a half-acre field
Tryin' to plow a furrow
Where the soil is made of steel
How I wish I was home, mom
Where the blue grass is growin'
And the sweet country boys"

And the new day promises (promises)
That everything will be alright

And the new day promises
That everything will be alright"
The Judds,Turn It Loose,"[Verse 1]
Some call it country with a little bit of rhythm and blues
And when the boys start rockin', there's a beat that you just can't lose
Where it's gonna take us, nobody knows
It sure feels good to the body and soul

[Chorus]
I love the slide of a steel guitar
I love the moan, moan, moan of an old blues harp
I love the shake of a tambourine
I love the bass when it's low and mean
So put on your shoutin' shoes and turn it loose
Turn it loose

[Verse 2]
You feel like dancin' and you just can't stay in your seat
Your knees start knockin' and you can't help stompin' your feet
Before you even know it, you'll be singin' along
It makes me wanna stay here all night long

[Chorus]
I love the slide of a steel guitar
I love the moan, moan, moan of an old blues harp
I love the shake of a tambourine
I love the bass when it's low and mean

The Judds,The Sweetest Gift,"[Verse 1]
One day a mother, come to a prison
To see an erring, but precious son
She told the warden how much she loved him
It did not matter what he had done

[Chorus]
She did not bring to him (Bring to him)
Parole or pardon (Pardon free)
She brought no silver (Brought no gold)
No pomp nor style (Him to see)
It was a halo (Halo bright)
Sent down from Heaven (Heaven's light)
The sweetest gift (A mother's smile)

Her boy had wandered far from the far side
Though she had pleaded with him each night
But not a word did she ever utter
That told her heartaches, her smile was bright

I'm holdin' back a flood of tears
Just thinkin' 'bout those happy years
Like all the good times that are no more
My love is gone, gone, gone forever more
Silence so deep only my soul can hear
Says now the past is what I fear
The future isn't what it used to be
Only today is all that's promised me

Wash away the pain and heal my mind
Flow on, river of time
Carry me away and leave it all far behind

Carry me away and leave it all far behind

The Judds,Give a Little Love,"[Verse 1]
Well, you can buy a diamond ring and slip it on my hand
Put me on a big ol' plane and fly me to a foreign land
Show me rows of fancy clothes, sayin', ""Honey, you can take your pick""
Well, that would be mighty kind, but it ain't gonna do the trick

[Chorus]
Give a little love

That's what a woman wants
So give a little love
Mm-hmm

Get this, you can be some big hunk, handsome, dark and tall

The Judds,Guardian Angels,"[Verse 1]
A hundred-year-old photograph stares out from a frame
And if you look real close you'll see, our eyes are just the same
I never met them face to face, but I still know them well
From the stories my dear grandma would tell

[Verse 2]
Elijah was a farmer, he knew how to make things grow
Fannie vowed she'd follow him wherever he would go
As things turned out, they never left, their small Kentucky farm
But he kept her fed, she kept him warm

[Chorus]
They're my guardian angels
And I know they can see
Every step I take
They are watching over me
I might not know where I'm goin'
But I'm sure where I come from
They're my guardian angels
And I'm their special one

[Verse 3]
Sometimes when I'm tired, I feel Elijah take my arm
He says, ""Keep a-goin', hard work never did a body harm""
And when I'm really troubled and I don't know what to do
Fannie whispers, ""Just do your best, we're awful proud of you""

[Chorus]
They're my guardian angels
And I know they can see
Every step I take
They are watching over me
I might not know where I'm goin'
But I'm sure where I come from
They're my guardian angels
And I'm their special one

[Outro]
A hundred-year-old photograph stares out from a frame
And if you look real close you'll see, our eyes are just the same"
The Judds,Change of Heart,"[Verse 1]
When you were mine
I was still playing
And promises I made
Were just words I was saying
I was playing you for a fool
Breaking love's precious rule
I did you so wrong
Guess you knew all along

[Verse 2]
That I had my boss lie for me
To say I was working late
And my friends alibied for me
When I'd slip out to meet a date
But, baby, now I see
I was only cheating me
Before you go
I just want you to know

[Chorus]
That I've had a change of heart
I've had a, had a change of heart
I see what I put you through
And I'll make it up to you
I've had a change of heart

[Verse 3]
I've just got to show you
How differently I feel
That I can be true to you
That my love is real
But my past will forever haunt me
If you say that you don't want me
I'm down on my knees
I'm begging you please
Won't you?

[Chorus]
Have a change of heart
Please have a, have a change of heart
I see what I put you through
I'll make it up to you
Please have a change of heart, woah, woah
Please have a change of heart
Please have a change of heart"
The Judds,Silver Bells,"[Verse 1]
Christmas makes you feel emotional
It may bring parties or thoughts devotional
Whatever happens, whatever may be
Here is what Christmas time means to me

[Chorus]
Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring a ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas Day

[Verse 2]
City sidewalks, busy sidewalks dressed in holiday style
In the air, there's a feeling of Christmas
Children laughing, people passing, meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner, you hear

[Chorus]
Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring a ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas Day

[Outro]
Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring a ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas Day
Soon it will be Christmas Day"
The Judds,Flies On The Butter / You Can’t Go Home Again,"Old tin roof, leaves in the gutter
A hole in the screen door big as your fist
And flies on the butter
Mama baking sugar cookies, we were watching cartoons
I heard her holler from the kitchen
""Which one of you youngen's wants to lick the spoon?""
Yellow jackets on the watermelon, honeysuckle in the air
Daddy turning on the sprinkler
Us kids running through it in our underwear
Old dog napping on the front porch, his ear just a twitching
Fell asleep on granddaddy's lap
To the sound of his pocket watch ticking
Oh, oh, it doesn't seem like it was all that long ago
Oh, oh, you can dream about it every now and then
But you can't go home again
Me and my best friend Jenny set up a backyard camp
Stole one of mama's mason jars
Poked holes in the lid and made a firefly lamp
Me and Billy Monroe, sneaking down by the river
I'm still haunted by the taste of the kiss
I was too scared to give him
Oh, oh, it doesn't seem like it was all that long ago
Oh, oh, you can dream about it every now and then
But you can't go home again
There's a blacktop road, a faded yellow centerline
It can take you back to the place
But it can't take you back in time
Oh, oh, it doesn't seem like it was all that long ago
Oh, oh, you can dream about it every now and then
But you can't go home again
Old tin roof, leaves in the gutter
A hole in the screen door big as your fist
And flies on the butter"
The Judds,Let Me Tell You About Love,"[Verse 1]
Well, ever since the day that time began
There's been this thing 'tween a woman and a man
Well, I don't know, but I do believe
It started in the garden with Adam and Eve
Sampson and Delilah had their fling
'Til she cut his hair and clipped his wing
It don't matter how the story's told
Love stays young, it can't grow old

[Chorus]
Let me tell you about love
About the moon and stars above
It's what we've all been dreamin' of
Let me tell you about love

[Verse 2]
Well, Bonaparte and Josephine
I believe they had a pretty good scene
Until she said, ""Bony boy, we're through!""
That's when he met his Waterloo
Julie baby and Romeo
Fell in love and stole the show
I know they are history
But there ain't been nothin' like you and me

[Chorus]
Let me tell you about love
About the moon and stars above
It's what we've all been dreamin' of
Let me tell you about love, mm
Let me tell you about love

[Interlude]
Take it, Perkins
Uh

[Verse 3]
Now Sheba she was a beauty queen
The purtiest thing that you ever have seen
Soloman, he was a mighty wise
'Til Sheba she done caught his eye
The world would be in a dreadful fix
If it wasn't for the love between the cats and chicks
This world wouldn't amount to much
Without a hug and a kiss and a tender touch

[Chorus]
And let me tell you about love
About the moon and stars above
It's what we've all been dreamin' of
Let me tell you about love
Let me tell you about love
About the moon and stars above
It's what we've all been dreamin' of
Let me tell you about love
Let me tell you about love
Let me tell you about love, yeah"
The Judds,Maybe Your Baby’s Got the Blues,"[Verse 1]
If you hear her cry at night
Better turn on your light
Maybe your baby's got the blues
When she says there's nothin' wrong
She just wants to be alone
You can bet your baby's got the blues

[Chorus]
Women like men to make the first move
And touch her like he used to
When there's achin' in her heart
Only tenderness can find
Women like men to make them feel alive
And keep her apron strings untied
Yes, women like men
To love them through the blues sometimes

[Verse 2]
When her days all run the same
And she says she thinks she needs a change
Maybe your baby's got the blues
If she says she's just a wife
And so far from the glamorous life
You can bet your baby's got the blues

[Chorus]
Women like men to make the first move
And touch her like he used to
When there's achin' in her heart
Only tenderness can find
Women like men to make them feel alive
And keep her apron strings untied
Yes, women like men
To love them through the blues sometimes
Mm, yes, women like men
To love them through the blues sometimes, mm"
Tammy Wynette,Stand By Your Man,"[Verse]
Sometimes it's hard to be a woman
Givin' all your love to just one man
You'll have bad times, and he'll have good times
Doin' things that you don't understand
But if you love him, you'll forgive him
Even though he's hard to understand
And if you love him, oh, be proud of him
Because, after all, he's just a man

[Chorus]
Stand by your man
Give him two arms to cling to
And somethin' warm to come to
When nights are cold and lonely
Stand by your man
And show the world you love him
Keep givin' all the love you can
Stand by your man

Stand by your man
And show the world you love him
Keep givin' all the love you can
Stand by your man"
Tammy Wynette,D-I-V-O-R-C-E,"[Verse 1]
Our little boy is four years old and quite a little man
So we spell out the words we don't want him to understand
Like T-O-Y or maybe S-U-R P-R-I-S-E
But the words we're hiding from him now
Tear the heart right out of me

[Chorus]
Our D-I-V-O-R-C-E becomes final today
Me and little J-O-E will be goin' away
I love you both and this will be pure H-E double L for me
Oh, I wish that we could stop this D-I-V-O-R-C-E

[Verse 2]
Watch him smile, he thinks it Christmas or his fifth Birthday
And he thinks C-U-S-T-O-D-Y spells fun or play
I spell out all the hurtin' words and turn my head when I speak
'Cause I can't spell away this hurt
That's drippin' down my cheek

[Chorus]
Our D-I-V-O-R-C-E becomes final today
Me and little J-O-E will be goin' away
I love you both and this will be pure H-E double L for me
Oh, I wish that we could stop this D-I-V-O-R-C-E"
Tammy Wynette,He,"He can turn the tides and calm the angry sea;
He alone decides who writes a symphony;
He lights every star that makes the darkness bright;
He keeps watch all through each long and lonely night;
He still finds the time to hear a child's first prayer;
Saint or sinner calls and always finds him there
Though it makes him sad to see the way we live
He'll always say, ""I forgive.""
He can grant a wish or make a dream come true;
He can paint the clouds and turn to gray the blue;
He alone is there to find a rainbow's end;
He alone can see what lies beyond the bend;
He can touch a tree and turn the leaves to gold;
He knows every lie that you and I have told
Though it makes him sad to see the way we liv
He'll always say, ""I forgive."""
Tammy Wynette,I Don’t Wanna Play House,"Today I sat alone at the window
And I watched our little girl outside at play
With the little boy next door like so many times before
But something didn't seem quite right today
So I went outside to see what they were doing
And then the teardrops made my eyes grow dim
'Cause I heard him name a game
And I hung my head in shame
When I heard our little girl say to him

I don't wanna play house
I know it can't be fun
I've watched mommy and daddy
And if that's the way it's done
I don't wanna play house
It makes my mommy cry
'Cause when she played house
My daddy said ""goodbye""

I don't wanna play house
I know it can't be fun
I've watched mommy and daddy
And if that's the way it's done
I don't wanna play house
It makes my mommy cry
'Cause when she played house
My daddy said ""goodbye"""
Tammy Wynette,Satin Sheets,"[Chorus]
Satin sheets to lie on
Satin pillows to cry on
Still, I'm not happy, don't you see?
Big long Cadillac
Tailor-mades upon my back
Still, I want you to set me free

[Verse]
I found another man
Who can give more than you can
Though you've given me everything money can buy
But your money can't hold me tight
Like he does on a long, long night
You know you didn't keep me satisfied

[Chorus]
(Satin sheets) Satin sheets to lie on
(Satin pillows) Satin pillows to cry on
Still, I'm not happy, don't you see?
Big long Cadillac
Tailor-mades upon my back
Still, I want you to set me free
(Satin sheets) Satin sheets to lie on
(Satin pillows) Satin pillows to cry on
Still, I'm not happy, don't you see?
Big long Cadillac
Tailor-mades upon my back
Still, I want you to set me free

(Satin pillows) Satin pillows to cry on"
Tammy Wynette,Your Good Girl’s Gonna Go Bad,"I've never seen the inside of a bar room
Or listened to a jukebox all night long
But I see these are the things that bring you pleasure
So I'm gonna make some changes in our home
I've heard it said if you can't beat'em join'em
So if that's the way you've wanted me to be
I'll change if it takes that to make you happy
From now on you're gonna see a different me

Because your good girl's gonna go bad
I'm gonna be the swingin'est swinger you've ever had
If you like'em painted up powdered up then you ought to be glad
Cause your good girl's gonna go bad

I'll even learn to like the taste of whiskey
In fact you'll hardly regonize your wife
I buy some brand new clothes and dress up fancy
For my journey to the wilder side of life

Because your good girl's gonna go bad
I'm gonna be the swingin'est swinger you've ever had
If you like'em painted up powdered up then you ought to be glad
Because your good girl'd gonna go bad
Oh yeah your good girls gonna go bad"
Tammy Wynette,Apartment No. 9,"Just follow the stairway
To this lonely world of mine
You'll find me waitin' here
In apartment number 9

Not so very long ago
You walked away from me
And after the all the plans we made
You decided to be free

Loneliness surrounds me
Without your arms around me
And the sun will never shine
In apartment number 9

I keep waiting in this lonely room
Just in case you change your mind
You'll find me waitin' here
In apartment number 9

Loneliness surrounds me
Without your arms around me
And the sun will never shine
In apartment number 9

No the sun will never shine in apartment number 9"
Tammy Wynette,’Til I Can Make It On My Own,"I'll need time to get you off my mind
And I may sometimes bother you
Try to be in touch with you
Even ask too much of you from time to time

Now and then
Lord, you know I'll need a friend
And 'till I get used to losing you
Let me keep on using you
'Til I can make it on my own

I'll get by, but no matter how I try
There'll be times that you'll know I'll call
Chances are my tears will fall
And I'll have no pride at all, from time to time

But they say, oh, there'll be a brighter day
But 'til then I lean on you
That's all I mean to do
'Til I can make it on my own

Surely someday I'll look up and see the morning sun
Without another lonely night behind me
Then I'll know I'm over you and all my crying's done
No more hurtin' memories can find me

But 'til then
Lord, You know I'm gonna need a friend
'Til I get used to losing you
Let me keep on using you
'Til I can make it on my own
'Til I can make it on my own"
Tammy Wynette,Honey (I Miss You),"See the tree how big it's grown
But that it hasn't been too long, it wasn't big
You laughed at me and I got mad
The first day that I planted, it was just a twig

Then the first snow came and I ran out
To brush the snow away so it wouldn't die
Came runnin' in all excited slipped and almost hurt myself
And you laughed till you cried

Yes, you were always young at heart
Kinda dumb and kinda smart and I loved you so
You surprised me with a puppy
Kept me up all Christmas Eve two years ago

And you could sure embarrass me
When you came home from working late 'cause you would know
That I'd been all alone and cryin'
Over some sad and lonely late, late show

And honey, I miss you too
And I know you're being good
And I'd love to be with you
If only I could

I wrecked the car and I was sad
And so afraid that you'd be mad, but what the heck
All afternoon you stormed around
But I knew how to cool you down, I hugged your neck

You came home unexpectedly
And caught me crying needlessly in the middle of the day
And it was in the early spring
When flowers bloom and robins sing, I went away

And honey, I miss you too
And I know you're being good
And I'd love to be with you
If only I could

One day you were not at home
While I was there and all alone, the angels came
Guess you thought it strange of me
To leave the way I did that day, it was a shame

But now your laughter just begun
And even though you miss me hon, you must go on
And when the snow fly passes overhead
And cries down on my flower bed
You know you're not alone

See the tree how big it's grown
But that it hasn't been too long, it wasn't big
You laughed at me and I got mad
The first day that I planted, it was just a twig"
Tammy Wynette,Help Me Make It Through The Night,"Take the ribbon from my hair shake it loose and let it fall
Laying soft against your skin like the shadows on the wall
Come and lay down by my side till the early morning light
All I'm taking is your time help me make it through the night
I don't care who's right or wrong I won't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow Lord tonight I need a friend
Yesterday is dead and gone and tomorrow's out of sight
I don't want to be alone help me make it through the night

I it's sad to be alone help me make it through the night
I don't want to be alone help me make it through the night"
Tammy Wynette,’Til I Get It Right,"I'll just keep on falling in love till I get it right
Right now I'm like a wounded bird hungry for the sky
But if I try my wings and try long enough I'm bound to learn to fly
So I'll just keep on falling in love till I get it right
My door to love has opened up more times than in
I'm either fool or wise enough to open it again
Cause I'll never know what's beyond that mountain till I reach the other side
So I'll just keep on falling in love till I get it right
If practice makes perfect then I'm near bout as perfect as I'll ever be in my life
So I'll just keep on falling in love till I get it right"
Tammy Wynette,No Charge,"My little girl came into the kitchen this evenin'
While I was fixin' supper
And she handed me a piece of paper she'd been writin' on
And after wipin' my hands on my apron
I read it - and this is what it said:

For mowin' the yard - five dollars
And for makin' my own bed this week - one dollar
And for goin' to the store - fifty cents
An' playin' with little sister, while you went to the store - twenty-five cents
Takin' out the trash - one dollar
Gettin' a good report card - five dollars
And for rakin' the yard - two dollars
Total owed - fourteen dollars and seventy-five cents

Well, I looked at her standin' there expectantly
And a thousand mem'ries flashed through my mind
So I picked up the pen, turnin' the paper over
This is what I wrote:

For the nine months I carried you
Growin' inside me - NO CHARGE
For the nights I've sat up with you
Doctored you, prayed for you - NO CHARGE
For the toys, food and clothes
And for wiping your nose, there's NO CHARGE
When you add it all up
The full cost of my love is NO CHARGE

Well, when she finished readin'
She had great big old tears in her eyes
And she looked up at me and said
""Mama, I sure do love you.""
Then she took the pen
And in great big letters
She wrote: ""PAID IN FULL.""

When you add it all up
The cost of real love is - NO CHARGE"
Tammy Wynette,Almost Persuaded,"Last night all alone in a barroom met a man with a drink in his hand
He had baby blue eyes coal black hair and a smile that a girl understands
Then he came and sat down at my table and as he placed his hand over mine
I found myself wanting to kiss him for temptation was flowing like wine
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside
Then we danced and he whispered I need you
Let me take you away and be your man
Then I looked into his eyes and I saw it the reflection of my wedding band
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home"
Tammy Wynette,Walk Through This World With Me,"Walk through this world with me go where I go
Share all my dreams with me I need you so
In life we search and some of us find
I've looked for you a long long time
And now that I found you new horizons I see
Come take my hand and walk through this world with me

Walk through this world with me go where I go
Share all my dreams with me I've searched for you so
And now that I found you new horizons I see
Come take my hand and walk through this world with me
Come take my hand and walk through this world with me"
Tammy Wynette,Bring Back My Baby to Me,"Far away horses on far away trails
Far away
Love of mine
Far away toils from a far away bail
Far away love of mine

My baby lies over and over
But he never lies here with me
My good love is long gone I'm lonesome
Oh, bring back my baby to me

Bring back bring back
Bring back my baby to me
Bring back bring back
Oh, bring back my baby to me

If I had my love to love over
I'd live in a house by the sea
I'd sleep in the arms of my baby
Oh, bring back my baby to me

Bring back bring back
Bring back my baby to me
Bring back bring back
Oh, bring back my baby to me
Bring back my baby to me"
Tammy Wynette,Womanhood,"Well, he said hold on, Patricia
I only tried to kiss ya
She said okay and then said don't you dare
She seems so badly shaking
He thought he was mistaken
But it sure looked like she bowed her head in prayer

I am a Christian, Lord
But I'm a woman too
If you are listening, Lord
Please show me what to do
I've tried hard to be what mama says is good
As I step into my womanhood

Shortly after midnight
She turned off the porch light
Walked into her bedroom all alone
She sat down and said
Well, Lord
God, I've been through hell, Lord
Wondering if I did right or wrong

I am a Christian
Lord, but I'm a woman too
If you are listening, Lord
Please show me what to do
I've tried hard to be what mama says is good
As I step into my womanhood
One more time

You heard, yes, I am a Christian, Lord
But I'm a woman too
If you are listening, Lord
Please show me what to do
I've tried hard to be what mama says is good
As I step into my womanhood

Slowly slip into my womanhood
Slowly slip into my womanhoo-oo-oo-ood..."
Tammy Wynette,I’m Only A Woman,"When you look at me as if to say you need me
You don't know how close I come to giving in
But I'm trying to be strong and to keep from doing wrong
I wish you'd never come to me again
Cause baby I'm only a woman only a woman
Can't you see my heart's not made of stone
Yes baby I'm only a woman only a woman so please till you're free leave me alone

Don't you know it hurts to know her arms will hold you
Don't you know how much I wish those arms were mine

But darling till you're free please don't reach out from me
Cause I don't want our love to be that kind
Cause baby I'm only a woman only a woman o please till you're free leave me alone"
Tammy Wynette,The Wonders You Perform,"Oh Lord, you know that I'm not one to bother you with little things
And you and I have never been too close
But we've always been on speakin' terms
I've watched you with doin' things
And tried to understand you more than most

No I haven't gone to church the way I ought to
But I always thought you knew in my own way I worshiped you
While even your own children doubt and fail to understand
The simple way you go about the things you do

I've seen the doubt upon the face of loved ones
As they sadly placed a wreath of flowers on a tiny grave
And wondered why a child is brought into the world
To only live a little while and die, you could have saved

But I believe that in your eyes this little child was something special
And you wanted it to be with you, no doubt
So with out-stretched arms you beckoned it so simple that I reckon
They can't understand the way you worked it out

Once I saw a young man growin' till he neared the age of knowing
Then I watched as somethin' happened to his mind
No doctor could correct it, it was just as I suspected
And I marveled at your way of bein' kind

They tried everything in vain and I was there when they explained it
To the family, how he slipped into a trance
Guess you looked into the future, watched him turn his back upon you
Lovin' him so much you couldn't take the chance

It took a lot of love to die, for sinners such as I
And I guess that's why you've never given up on me
You understood when some denied you and even when they crucified you
Knowin' all these things were meant to be

For the stable's such a simple thing, no wonder there were few who came
To see a king the night that"
Tammy Wynette,Sometimes When We Touch,"You ask me if I love you
And I choke on my reply
Id rather hurt you honestly
Than mislead you with a lie
And who am I to judge you
In what you say or do
I'm only just beginning
To see the real you
And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I want to hold you till I die
Till we both break down and cry
I want to hold you till the fear in me subsides
Romance and all its strategy
Leaves me battling with my pride
But through all the insecurity
Some tenderness survives
I'm just another writer
Still trapped within my truth
A hesitant prize fighter
Still trapped within my youth
And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I want to hold you till I die
Till we both break down and cry
I want to hold you till the fear in me subsides
At times Id like to break you
And drive you to your knees
At times Id like to break through
And hold you endlessly
At times I understand you
And I know how hard you try
I watched while love commands you
And Ive watched love pass you by
At times I think were drifters
Still searching for a friend
A brother or a sister
But then the passion flares again
And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I want to hold ya till I die
Till we both break down and cry
I want to hold you till the fear in me subsides
Subsides"
Tammy Wynette,Higher Ground,"I'm safe 'cause your love lifts me to a higher ground
(Higher ground)
To a higher ground

Well, I have sat alone at night
And cried myself to sleep
And I have prayed my soul to take
When sorrow seems so deep

But darkness turns so quickly
To the light of day
When someone special came along
And carried me away

Chorus:
You lift me up when I get down
When I'm lost you turn me around
Wind and rain can't wash away
The peace you give to me

And in a sea of trouble
I know that I won't drown
I'm safe 'cause your love
Lifts me to a higher ground (higher ground)
To a higher ground

Troubled times may bring me down
And drive me to my knees
And I am blinded by despair
And cannot see

But you take a hold
And carry me again
Then I know I'll never break
Though I sometimes bend

You lift me up when I get down
When I'm lost you turn me around
Wind and rain can't wash away
The peace you give to me

And in a sea of trouble
I know that I won't drown
I'm safe 'cause your love
Lifts me to a higher ground (higher ground)
To a higher ground

Lifts me to a higher ground

You lift me up when I get down
When I'm lost you turn me around
Wind and rain can't wash away
The peace you give to me

An' in a sea of trouble
I know that I won't drown
I'm safe 'cause your love lifts me to a higher ground
Lifts me up when..."
Tammy Wynette,Singing My Song,"Here's a song I love to sing
It's about the man that wears my ring
And even though he 's tempted he knows
I'll make sure that he gets everything
Cause when he's cold he knows i'm warm
And i warm him in my arms
And when he said how i make him glad and i'm his shelter from the storm
I'm his song when he feels like singin
And i swing when he feels like swingin
I don't know what i'd do that's right but it makes him come home at night
And when he's home i make sure he's never alone
And that's why i keep singin my song
And when he's home i make sure he's never alone
And that's why i keep singin my song"
Tammy Wynette,When There’s a Fire In Your Heart,"When there's a fire in your heart
Break the glass sound the alarm
Call on me I'll be there
Instant service, speedy, fast
I was your first I'll be your last
No matter who you have in between

When there's a fire in your heart
Break the glass sound the alarm
When she's not all she seems
Instant service, speedy, fast
I was your first I'll be your last
No matter who you have in between

There's been hearts spells
In close spells ever since we met
I've seen your small fires, your big fires
But I won't give up yet

Oh, someday you'll yearn cause your heart's gonna burn
For that old familiar glow
You'll be burned out on, smoke out
And come back to me I know

[Instrumental]

Every thrill that you blaze
Makes me stay up closer behind
While you've been datin' I've been waitin'
Just hurtin' all the time

Your new flames was older and all will grow colder
For mine was higher and higher
So I'm hanging on your sea
'Cause you'll come running back to me
'Cause I'm fightin' fire with with fire

When there's a fire in your heart
Break the glass sound the alarm
Call on me I'll be there
Instant service, speedy, fast
I was your first I'll be your last
No matter who you have in between

When there's a fire in your heart
Break the glass sound the alarm
When she's not all she seems
Instant service, speedy, fast
I was your first I'll be your last
No matter who you have in between"
Tammy Wynette,He’s Just An Old Love Turned Memory,"(He's just an old love turned memory)
(But he still turns the world upside down)

I called you today, an accidental mistake
And his name slipped out to some friend
Forgotten old feelings are brand new today
'Cause I'm right back where I've always been

He's just an old love turned memory
Now I seldom see him around
He's just an old love turned memory
But he still turns the world upside down

I went to some places where I knew you'd be
Just to prove our love was over and done
But the moment his eyes meet mine, I knew
My sorrow had only begun

He's just an old love turned memory
Now I seldom see him around
He's just an old love turned memory
But he still turns my world upside down

He still turns my world upside down"
Tammy Wynette,Gentle On My Mind,"It's knowing that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch
And it's knowing I'm not shackled
By forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that are dried upon some line
That keeps you on the backroads
By the rivers of my memory
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clinging to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or something that somebody said
Because they thought we fit together walking
It's just knowing that the world will not be cursing
Or forgiving when I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're moving on the backroads
By the rivers of my memory
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
Cause she turned and I was gone
I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me 'til I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see you walkin' on the backroads
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin'
Cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughnin' coal pile, and
A dirty hat pulled low across my face
Through cupped hands 'round the tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're waiting from the backroads
By the rivers of my memories
Ever smilin' ever gentle on my mind
Gentle on my mind
You are gentle on my mind"
Tammy Wynette,Bedtime Story,"I've told you almost ev'ry bedtime story
And you've heard almost ev'ry nursery rhyme
So, tonight before you go to sleep
And pray the Lord your soul to keep
Here's mommy's favorite story one more time

Once upon a time there was a castle
And in this castle lived a King and Queen
And it came to pass, they were both were blessed
By one little blue-eyed princess
With the softest golden curls you've ever seen

But then one day, he met this pretty lady
And she had lots of pretty words to say
And this part makes your mommy sad
'Cause,oh, what big eyes she had
And she took his hand and led him far away

Still, it's just another bedtime story
But tellin' it brings teardrops to my eyes
Just another pretty bedtime story
So, please forgive mommy if she cries

Then it came to pass, the King grew lonely
And the pretty lady wasn't all she seemed
He realized that he was wrong
And started his long journey home
For he misses little Princess and his Queen

Then he was back and safe inside his castle
And tears of joy came pourin' down like rain
Then the castle rang with laughter
They lived happy ever after
Knowin' he would never leave again

Still, it's just another bedtime story
But tellin' it brings teardrops to my eyes
Just another pretty bedtime story
So, please forgive mommy if she cries

Won't you please forgive your mommy
If she cries"

I'll have to pack my things and go (That's right)

Oh, now, baby, please (Don't ya come back no more)
What you're trying to do to me? (Don't ya come back no more)"

Ray Charles,"Hallelujah, I Love Her So","Let me tell you about a girl I know
She is my baby and she live next door
Every morning 'fore the sun comes up
She bring my coffee in my favorite cup
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

When I'm in trouble and I have no friends
I know she'll go with me until the end
Everybody asks me how I know
I smile at them and say she told me so
That's why I know, oh, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

Now if I call her on the telephone
And tell her that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
I hear her on my door

In the evening when the sun goes down
When there is nobody else around
She kisses me and she hold me tight
And tell me ""Daddy, everything's all right""
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

Now if I call her on the telephone
And tell her that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
I hear her on my door

In the evening when the sun goes down
When there is nobody else around
She kisses me and she hold me tight
And tell me ""Daddy, everything's all right""
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

Oh, hallelujah
Don't you know I just love her so

Baby, I'm a little fool for you girl"
Ray Charles,A Song For You,"[Verse 1]
I've been so many places in my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymes
I've acted out my life in stages, with ten thousand people watching
But we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you

[Verse 2]
I know your image of me is what I hope to be, baby
I've treated you unkindly but girl can't you see
There's no one more important to me
So darling, can't you please see through me
Because we're alone now and I'm singing my song for you

[Bridge]
You taught me precious secrets of the truth, withholding nothing
But you came out in front and I was hiding, yeah
But now I'm so much better so if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody 'cause my love's in there hiding

[Verse 3]
I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for my life, because you're a friend of mine
And when my life is over, remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singing my song for you

[Outro]
I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for my life, yes, you're a friend of mine
And when my life is over, remember when we were together

We were alone and I was singing my song

Singing my song
Singing my song

Ray Charles,Seven Spanish Angels,"[Verse 1: Ray Charles]
He looked down into her brown eyes
And said, ""Say a prayer for me""
She threw her arms around him
Whispered, ""God will keep us free""
They could hear the riders coming
He said ""This is my last fight
If they take me back to Texas
They won't take me back alive""

[Chorus: Ray Charles]
There were seven Spanish angels
At the Altar of the Sun
They were praying for the lovers
In the Valley of the Gun
When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared
There was thunder from the throne
And seven Spanish angels
Took another Angel home

[Verse 2: Willie Nelson]
She reached down and picked the gun up
That lay smoking in his hand
She said, ""Father please forgive me
I can't make it without my man""
And she knew the gun was empty
And she knew she couldn't win
But her final prayer was answered
When the rifles fired again

[Chorus: Willie Nelson]
There were seven Spanish angels
At the Altar of the Sun
They were praying for the lovers
In the Valley of the Gun
When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared
There was thunder from the throne
And seven Spanish angels
Took another Angel home

[Chorus: Ray Charles]
There were seven Spanish angels
At the Altar of the Sun
They were praying for the lovers
In the Valley of the Gun
When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared
There was thunder from the throne
And seven Spanish angels
Took another Angel home

[Interlude: Ray Charles]
Alright, y'all help me now

[Chorus: Both]
There were seven Spanish angels
At the Altar of the Sun (Oh I believe)
They were praying for the lovers (Yeah they was)
In the Valley of the Gun (Well, well, well)
When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared
There was thunder from the throne (Oh, yeah)
And seven Spanish angels
Took another Angel home"

For amber waves of grain
For purple mountain majesties
Above the fruited plain
But now wait a minute, I'm talking about

Ray Charles,Am I Blue,"[Verse 1]
Am I blue?
Am I blue?
Ain't these tears in these eyes telling you?

[Verse 2]
Am I blue?
You'd be too
If your schemes, like your dreams, done fell through

[Bridge]
Was a time
I was her only one
Now I am
The sad and lonely one
Oh, yes, I am

Was I gay?
'Til today
Now she's gone and we're through
Am I blue?

Ray Charles,Lift Every Voice and Sing,"[Intro]
I got something in my bones
Make me wanna shout ""Hallelujah""
And when I sing it, sing on
I sing on
Woo, Lord help me

[Verse 1]
Lift every voice and sing, 'til earth and Heaven ring
Ring with the harmonies of liberty
Let our rejoicing rise high as the listening skies
Let it resound loud as the rolling sea
Come on, y'all
Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us
Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us
Hey, facing the rising sun, oh, of the new day begun
And let us march on 'til the victory's won

[Verse 2]
God of our weary years, God of our silent tears
Thou Who hast brought us thus far along the way
Thou Who hast by Thy might led us into the light
And keep us forever, oh, in the path we pray
One more time, y'all
Lest our feet stray from the places, our God, where we met Thee
My Lord, my God
Lest our hearts, drunk with the wine of the world, we forget Thee
Help me, oh
Shadowed beneath Thy hand, may we forever stand
True to our God and true to our native land
[Outro]
Facing the rising sun of the new day begun
And let us march on 'til our victory is won
Amen, Amen"
Ray Charles,That Spirit of Christmas,"[Verse 1]
Christmas is that time of year
For being with the ones we love
Sharing so much joy and cheer
What a wonderful feelin'
Watching the ones we love
Having so much fun
I was sittin' by the fire side
Taking a walk through the snow
Listening to a children's choir
Singing songs about Jesus
The blessed way that he came to us

[Chorus]
Why can't it remain
All through the year
Each day the same
Ah, that's what I wanna hear
Heh-heh, it's truly amazin'
That spirit of Christmas

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
All the kinfolk gather 'round
The lovely Christmas tree
Hearts are glowing full of joy
Sense the gifts that we're giving
And the love that we're living

[Chorus]
Why can't it remain (Why can't it remain?)
Oh, all through the year (All through the year)
Each day the same (Each day the same)
Ah, that's what I wanna hear
I'll tell ya, it's truly amazin'
That spirit of Christmas
Let me hear ya
(Why can't it remain?) Why can't it remain?

(Each day the same) Each day the same
And that's what I wanna hear
Listen to me, it's truly amazin'
That spirit of Christmas

Oh, it's truly amazin'
That spirit of Christmas
Ain't it so? It's truly amazin'
Yeah, that spirit of Christmas
Oh, Christmas
Oh Christmas"
Ray Charles,Mother,"[Chorus]
And i surely still do miss my mother
Doesn't matter how old that i grow
Mother's love will stay with me all through life
No matter where i go
Ever since the lord called
And she left us
Parts of her flow through me
Every day
God has taken her
But no one could ever take
Mother's love away

[Verse 1]
Mama could be strong but you knew that she loved you
She taught me how to walk and talk and pray
Since she's gone on a heaven
All those memories of those days
And i think of the things that i didn't get a chance to say

[Chorus]
And i surely still do miss my mother
Doesn't matter how old that i grow
Mother's love will stay with me all through life
No matter where i go
Ever since the lord called
And she left us
Parts of her flow through me
Every day
God has taken her
But no one could ever take
Mother's love away

[Verse 2]
Always there the first thing the morning
Making sure that i got up for school
Get yourself ready to go
She said go to class and learn some more
And remember that there's no one in the word better than you
That's why i miss my mother

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
There ain't no blues that have been written
That could make me feel this way
I lost the one that was there for me all my life
The day the Lord took mama far away

[Chorus]"
Ray Charles,Ellie My Love,"[Verse 1]
There were times I left your heart in pain
Time again I turned and walked away
I get to where I'm going just to find
Won't be happy in this world
If you're not by my side
Ellie, my love, so sweet

[Verse 2]
My heart told me to break away
Now I'm out here far away
Wishing that I could hold you in the night, baby
Then I'd wake up to a morning that is warm and bright
Whoa, Ellie, my love, so sweet

[Chorus]
Smile for me, won't you, baby
Forever you'll be on my mind

Ray Charles,Drown In My Own Tears,"[Verse]
It brings a tear into my eyes
When I begin to realize
I've cried so much since you've been gone
I guess I'm drowning in my own tears

I sit and cry just like a child
My pouring tears are running wild
If you don't think you'll be home soon
I guess I'll drown, oh yeah, in my own tears

I know it's true into each life
Oh some rain, rain must pour
I'm so blue here without you
It keeps raining more and more

Why don't you come on home?
Oh yes, so I won't be all alone
If you don't think you'll be home soon
I guess I'll (drown in my own tears)

Ooh, don't let me
(Drown in my own tears)
When I'm in trouble, baby

Oh, yeah, baby don't let me

I guess I'll drown in my own tears
Oh, mmmmm"
Ray Charles,In the Heat of the Night,"[Verse 1]
In the heat of the night
Seems like a cold sweat creeping cross my brow, yeah
In the heat of the night
I'm feeling motherless somehow
Stars with evil eyes stare from the skies
All mean and bright
In the heat of the night

[Verse 2]
Ain't a woman yet been born
Knows how to make the morning come
It's so hard to keep control
When I could sell my soul
For just a little light
In the heat of the night

[Verse 3]
In the heat of the night
I've got trouble wall to wall, oh yes I have
I repeat, I repeat in the night
Must be an ending to it all
But hold on, it won't be long
Just you be strong
And it'll be alright
In the heat of the night
In the heat of the night"
Ray Charles,Lonely Avenue,"[Verse 1]
Now my room has got two windows
But the sunshine never comes through
You know it's always dark and dreary
Since I broke off, baby, with you

I live on a lonely avenue
My little girl wouldn't say I do
Well, I feel so sad and blue
And it's all because of you

[Chorus]
I could cry, I could cry, I could cry
(I could die, I could die, I could die)
'Cause I live on a lonely avenue
(Lonely avenue) Yes sir

[Verse 2]
Now my covers, they feel like lead
And my pillow, it feels like stone
Well, I've tossed and turned so every night
I'm not used to being alone

I live on a lonely avenue
My little girl wouldn't say I do
Well, I feel so sad and blue
You know it's all because of you

[Chorus]
I could cry, I could cry, I could cry
(I could die, I could die, I could die)
'Cause I live on a lonely avenue
Yes sir (lonely avenue)

Lonely avenue
Lonely avenue

[Verse 3]
Now I've been so sad and lonesome
Since you left this town
You know if I could beg or borrow the money
Child, I would be highway bound

I live on a lonely avenue
My little girl wouldn't say I do
Well, I feel so sad and blue
You know it's all because of you

[Chorus]
I could cry, I could cry, I could cry
(I could die, I could die, I could die) Oh ooh, yeah
I live on a lonely avenue

Let's go get stoned
Yeah (Oh-oh-oh)
Let's go get stoned
Everybody
Let's go get stoned
Oh-oh-oh
Let's go get stoned
Now wait a minute

[Verse 1]
You know my baby
She won't let me in

And then I'm gonna call my buddy
On the telephone and say

You know I work so hard
All day long
Everything I try to do
Seem to always turn out wrong

On my way home and say

Ain't no harm
To have a little a taste
But don't lose your cool
And start messin' up the man's place

And bust your lip, mm no no

The Chicks,Not Ready to Make Nice,"[Verse 1]
Forgive? Sounds good
Forget? I'm not sure I could
They say time heals everything
But I'm still waiting

[Verse 2]
I'm through with doubt
There's nothin' left for me to figure out
I've paid a price
And I'll keep payin'

[Chorus]
I'm not ready to make nice
I'm not ready to back down
I'm still mad as hell and I don't have time
To go 'round and 'round and 'round
It's too late to make it right
I probably wouldn't if I could
'Cause I'm mad as hell, can't bring myself
To do what it is you think I should

[Verse 3]
I know you've said
""Can't you just get over it?""
It turned my whole world around
And I kinda like it

[Bridge]
I made my bed and I sleep like a baby
With no regrets and I don't mind sayin'
It's a sad, sad story when a mother will teach her
Daughter that she ought to hate a perfect stranger
And how in the world can the words that I said
Send somebody so over the edge
That they'd write me a letter, sayin' that I better
Shut up and sing or my life will be over

[Chorus]
I'm not ready to make nice
I'm not ready to back down
I'm still mad as hell and I don't have time
To go 'round and 'round and 'round
It's too late to make it right
I probably wouldn't if I could
'Cause I'm mad as hell, can't bring myself
To do what it is you think I should
I'm not ready to make nice
I'm not ready to back down
I'm still mad as hell and I don't have time
To go 'round and 'round and 'round
It's too late to make it right
I probably wouldn't if I could
'Cause I'm mad as hell, can't bring myself
To do what it is you think I should
What it is you think I should

[Outro]
Forgive, sounds good
Forget, I'm not sure I could
They say time heals everything
But I'm still waiting

The Chicks,Travelin’ Soldier,"[Verse 1]
Two days past eighteen
He was waitin' for the bus in his army greens
Sat down in a booth in a cafe there
Gave his order to a girl with a bow in her hair

[Verse 2]
He's a little shy so she give him a smile
And he said, ""Would you mind sittin' down for a while
And talkin' to me? I'm feelin' a little low""
She said ""I'm off in an hour and I know where we can go""

[Verse 3]
So they went down and they sat on the pier
He said ""I bet you got a boyfriend, but I don't care
I got no one, to send a letter to
Would you mind if I sent a-one back here to you?""

[Chorus]
I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
""Too young for him,"" they told her
Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
Nevermore to be alone
When the letter said, ""A soldier's comin' home""

[Verse 4]
So the letters came from an army camp
In California then Vietnam
And he told her of his heart, it might be love
And all of the things he was so scared of

[Verse 5]
He said, ""When it's gettin' kinda rough over here
I think of that day sittin' down on the pier
And I close my eyes and see your pretty smile
Don't worry but I won't be able to write for a while""

[Chorus]
I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
""Too young for him,"" they told her
Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
Nevermore to be alone
When the letter said, ""A soldier's comin' home""

[Verse 6]
One Friday night at a football game
The Lord's Prayer said and the anthem sang
A man said, ""Folks, would you bow your heads
For a list of local Vietnam dead?""

[Verse 7]
Cryin' all alone under the stands
Was a piccolo player in the marchin' band
And one name read, and nobody really cared
But a pretty little girl with a bow in her hair

[Chorus]
I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
""Too young for him,"" they told her
Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
Nevermore to be alone
When the letter said, ""A soldier's comin'...""

[Chorus]
I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
""Too young for him,"" they told her
Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
Nevermore to be alone
When the letter said, ""A soldier's comin' home"""

We moved to California and we followed your dreams
I believed in the promises you made to me
Swore that night 'til death do us part
But you lie-lie-lie-lie-lied
Hollywood welcomed you with open doors

You thought I wouldn't see it if you put it in my face
Give you all my money, you'll gladly walk away
You think it's justifiable, I think it's pretty cruel
And you know you lie best when you lie to you
'Cause, boy, you know exactly what you did on my boat
And, boy, that's exactly why you ain't comin' home
Save your tired stories for your new someone else
'Cause they're lie-lie-lie-lie-lies

You're sorry, but where's my apology?

Just had to start a fire, had to start a fire
Couldn't take yourself on a road a little higher
Had to burn it up, had to tear it down
Tried to say I'm crazy, babe, we know I'm not crazy, that's you
Gaslighting
You're a li-li-li-liar
Oh, honey, that's you

You made your bed and then your bed caught fire

The Chicks,Landslide,"[Verse 1]
I took my love and I took it down
I climbed a mountain and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well, the landslide brought me down

[Verse 2]
Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)

Well, I've been afraid of changing
'Cause I built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Children get older
I'm getting older, too
Well

So, take this love and take it down
Yeah, and if you climb a mountain and you turn around
And if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well, the landslide brought me down
And if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills

The landslide will bring you down"
The Chicks,Goodbye Earl,"[Verse 1]
Mary Anne and Wanda were the best of friends
All through their high school days
Both members of the 4H Club
Both active in the FFA
After graduation Mary Anne went out
Lookin' for a bright new world
Wanda looked all around this town
And all she found was Earl

[Verse 2]
Well, it wasn't two weeks after she got married
That Wanda started gettin' abused
She put on dark glasses and long sleeved blouses
And makeup to cover a bruise
Well, she finally got the nerve to file for divorce
She let the law take it from there
But Earl walked right through that restraining order
And put her in intensive care

[Pre-Chorus]
Right away, Mary Anne flew in from Atlanta
On a red-eye midnight flight
She held Wanda's hand and they worked out a plan
And it didn't take 'em long to decide

[Chorus]
That Earl had to die
Goodbye, Earl
Those black-eyed peas
They tasted alright to me, Earl
You're feeling weak
Why don't you lay down and sleep, Earl?
Ain't it dark
Wrapped up in that tarp, Earl?

[Verse 3]
The cops came by to bring Earl in
They searched the house high and low
Then they tipped their hats
And said ""Thank you ladies, if you hear from him let us know,""

[Verse 4]
Well, the weeks went by and
Spring turned to summer
And summer faded into fall
And it turns out he was a missing person
Who nobody missed at all

[Pre-Chorus]
So the girls bought some land at a roadside stand
Out on Highway 109
They sell Tennessee ham
And strawberry jam
And they don't lose any sleep at night, 'cause

[Chorus]
Earl had to die
Goodbye Earl
We need a break
Let's go out to the lake, Earl
We'll pack a lunch
And stuff you in the trunk, Earl
Well, is that all right?
Good, let's go for a ride Earl
Hey

Brenda's packin' heat 'cause she don't like Mondays
Underpaid teacher policin' the hallways
Print yourself a weapon and take it to the gun range
(Ah, cut the shit, you ain't goin' to the gun range)
Standin' with Emma and our sons and daughters
Watchin' our youth have to solve our problems
I'll follow them, so who's comin' with me?
(Half of you love me, half already hate me)

March, march to my own drum

[Verse 2]
Tell the ol' boys in the white bread lobby
What they can and can't do with their bodies
Temperatures are risin', cities are sinkin'
(Ah, cut the shit, you know your city is sinkin')
Lies are truth and truth is fiction
Everybody's talkin', who's gonna listen?
What the hell happened in Helsinki?

The Chicks,Sleep at Night,"[Verse 1]
Not that you asked
But I'm getting past everything, everything
I'm doing okay
Just glad it's not yesterday, huh

[Pre-Chorus]
My husband's girlfriend's husband just called me up
How messed up is that?
It's so insane that I have to laugh
But then I think about our two boys trying to become men
There's nothing funny about that

How do you sleep at night? (Oh)
How do you tell those lies? (Oh)
Lookin' me in the eye (Oh)
Livin' a double life
Tell me, how do you sleep at night? (Oh)
How do you sleep at night?

[Verse 2]
You're only as sick as your secrets
So I'm telling everything
Half of the shit you won't believe
But I know it's not unique to me

[Pre-Chorus]
Remember you brought her to our show at the Hollywood Bowl
She said, ""I love you, I'm such a fan""
I joked that you can love me as long as you don't love my man
There's nothin' funny about that

The Chicks,Wide Open Spaces,"[Verse 1]
Who doesn't know what I'm talkin' about
Who's never left home, who's never struck out
To find a dream and a life of their own
A place in the clouds, a foundation of stone

[Verse 2]
Many precede and many will follow
A young girl's dreams no longer hollow
It takes the shape of a place out west
But what it holds for her, she hasn't yet guessed

[Chorus]
She needs, wide open spaces
Room to make her big mistakes
She needs, new faces
She knows the high stakes

[Verse 3]
She traveled this road as a child
Wide-eyed and grinning, she never tired
But now she won't be coming back with the rest
If these are life's lessons, she'll take this test

[Chorus]
She needs, wide open spaces
Room to make her big mistakes
She needs, new faces
She knows the high stakes
She knows the high stakes

[Bridge]
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah

[Verse 4]
As her folks drive away her dad yells, ""Check the oil""
Mom stares out the window and says, ""I'm leavin' my girl""
She said, ""It didn't seem like that long ago""
When she stood there and let her own folks know

[Chorus]
She needed, wide open spaces
Room to make her big mistakes
She needs, new faces
She knows the high stakes
She knows the high stakes
She knows the highest stakes

She knows the highest stakes
She knows the highest stakes

The Chicks,Cowboy Take Me Away,"[Verse 1]
I said, ""I wanna touch the earth
I wanna break it in my hands
I wanna grow something wild and unruly
I wanna sleep on the hard ground
In the comfort of your arms
On a pillow of bluebonnets
In a blanket made of stars""
Oh, it sounds good to me, I said

I wanna skip and not fall
I wanna look at the horizon
And not see a building standing tall
I wanna be the only one
For miles and miles
Except for maybe you
And your simple smile

Yes, it sounds so good to me

The Chicks,You Were Mine,"[Verse 1]
I can't find a reason to let go
Even though you've found a new love and she's what your dreams are made of
I can find a reason to hang on
What went wrong can be forgiven, without you, it ain't worth livin' alone

[Chorus]
Sometimes I wake up cryin' at night
And sometimes I scream out your name
What right does she have to take you away
When for so long you were mine?

[Verse 2]
I took out all the pictures of our wedding day
It was a time of love and laughter, happy ever after
But even those old pictures have begun to fade
Please tell me she's not real and that you're really comin' home to stay

[Chorus]
Sometimes I wake up cryin' at night
And sometimes I scream out your name
What right does she have to take your heart away
When for so long you were mine?

I can give you two good reasons
To show you love's not blind
He's two and she's four and you know they adore you
So, how can I tell them you've changed your mind?

Sometimes I wake up cryin' at night
And sometimes I scream out your name
What right does she have to take your heart away

Have to tame my mind

Can't go back in time
To change in someone's eyes
No, I was not something to play with

Amidst the dancing lights
When it feels too wild for breathing
I can't sleep at night
Unless I start to lie
And believe it like a story, no, no

So insane, I'm so used to my nightmares
It's okay 'til it's not and I'm back there

The Chicks,Long Time Gone,"[Verse 1]
Daddy sits on a front porch swinging
Looking out on a vacant field
Used to be filled with burley t'bacca
Now he knows it never will
My Brothers found work in Indiana
M' Sisters a nurse at the old folks home
Mama still cooking too much for supper
And me I’ve been a long time gone

[Chorus]
Been a long time gone
No, I ain't hoed a row since I don't know when
Long time gone
And it ain't coming back again

[Verse 2]
Deliah plays that ol' church pian'a
Sitting out on her daddy’s farm
She always thought that we'd be together
Lord I never meant to do her harm
Said she could hear me singin' in the choir
Me, I heard another song
I caught wind and hit the road runnin'
And Lord, I've been a long time gone

[Chorus]
Been a long time gone
Lord, I ain't had a prayer since I don't know when
Long time gone
And it ain't coming back again

[Bridge]
Now me, I went to Nashville
Tryin' to beat the big deal
Playin' down on Broadway
Gettin' there the hard way
Living from a tip jar
Sleeping in my car
Hocking my guitar
Yeah I’m gonna be a star

[Verse 3]
Now, me and Deliah singing every Sunday
Watching the children and the garden grow
We listen to the radio to hear what's cookin’
But the music ain't got no soul
Now they sound tired but they don't sound Haggard
They've got money but they don't have Cash
They got Junior but they don't have Hank
I think, I think, I think
[Outro]
The rest is a long time gone
No, I ain't hit the roof since I don’t know when
Long time gone
And it ain't coming back
I said a long time gone
No, I ain't honked the horn since I don’t know when
Long time gone
And it ain't coming back again
I said a long time, long time, long time gone
Well it’s been a long time
Long time, long time, long time gone
Oh, it's been a long time gone
Long time, long time, long time gone

The Chicks,Hope It’s Something Good,"[Verse 1]
There I go trying to keep myself distracted
So I make the bed, call a friend, do the dishes
Should I have known? Should I have seen a sign?
When did you know? Why'd you pretend to try?

[Chorus]
If you’re gone
I hope it's really worth it
Twenty years of hanging on
Now it all adds up to nothin'
Gave up on the moon and back
Thought you’d found a better half
Ah, I hope it's something good

[Verse 2]
Highs and lows, we fought our wars with silence
I'd have called you out, but baby, I knew you'd deny it
After so long, I learned to hold my tongue
And now that you're done, I get to write this song

[Chorus]
And if you're gone
I hope it's really worth it
Twenty years of hanging on
Now it all adds up to nothin'
Gave up on the moon and back
Thought you’d found a better half
Ah, I hope it’s something good

[Bridge]
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

[Chorus]
If you're gone
I hope it’s really worth it

The Chicks,There’s Your Trouble,"[Verse 1]
It should've been different, but it wasn't different, was the
Same old story, ""Dear John,"" and so long
It should've fit like a glove, it should've fit like a ring
Like a diamond ring, a token of true love

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Should've all worked out, but it didn't
She should be here now, but she isn't

[Chorus]
There's your trouble, there's your trouble
You keep seein' double with the wrong one
And you can't see I love you, you can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holdin' on
There's your trouble

[Verse 2]
So now you're thinkin' 'bout all you're missin' how
Deep you're sinkin', 'round and 'round and draggin' down
Why don't you cash in your chips, why don't you call it a loss
Not such a big loss, chalk it up to better luck

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Could've been true love, but it wasn't
It should all add up, but it doesn't

[Chorus]
There's your trouble, there's your trouble
You keep seein' double with the wrong one
You can't see I love you, you can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holdin' on
There's your trouble

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Should've all worked out, but it didn't
She should be here now, but she isn't

[Chorus]
There's your trouble, there's your trouble
You keep seein' double with the wrong one
And you can't see I love you, you can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holdin' on
There's your trouble
There's your trouble
There's your trouble
There's your trouble
There is your trouble"
The Chicks,Easy Silence,"[Verse 1]
When the calls and conversations
Accidents and accusations
Messages and misperceptions
Paralyze my mind
Busses, cars, and airplanes leaving
Burning fumes of gasoline
And everyone is running
And I come to find a refuge in the

[Chorus]
Easy silence that you make for me
It's okay when there's nothing more to say to me
And the peaceful quiet you create for me
And the way you keep the world at bay for me
The way you keep the world at bay

[Verse 2]
Monkeys on the barricades
Are warning us to back away
They form commissions trying to find
The next one they can crucify
And anger plays on every station
Answers only make more questions
I need something to believe in
Breathe in sanctuary in the

[Chorus]
Easy silence that you make for me
It's okay when there's nothing more to say to me
And the peaceful quiet you create for me
And the way you keep the world at bay for me

Children lose their youth too soon
Watching war made us immune
And I've got all the world to lose
But I just want to hold on to the

Easy silence that you make for me
It's okay when there's nothing more to say to me
And the peaceful quiet you create for me
And the way you keep the world at bay for me
The way you keep the world at bay
Easy silence that you make for me
It's okay when there's nothing more to say to me
And the peaceful quiet you create for me
And the way you keep the world at bay for me
The way you keep the world at bay"
The Chicks,Top of the World,"[Verse 1]
I wished I was smarter
I wished I was stronger
I wished I loved Jesus
The way my wife does
I wished it had been easier
Instead of any longer
I wished I could have stood
Where you would've been proud
But that won't happen now
That won't happen now

[Chorus]
There's a whole lot of singin' that's never gonna be heard
Disappearin' every day without so much as a word, somehow
Think I broke the wings off that little songbird
She's never gonna fly to the top of the world right now
Top of the world

[Verse 2]
I don't have to answer
Any of these questions
Don't have no God to
Teach me no lessons
I come home in the evenin'
Sit in my chair
One night they called me for supper but I never got up
I stayed right there in my chair

[Chorus]
There's a whole lot of singin' that's never gonna be heard
Disappearin' every day without so much as a word, somehow
Think I broke the wings off that little songbird
She's never gonna fly to the top of the world right now

[Verse 3]
I wished I'da known you
Wished I'da shown you
All of the things I
Was on the inside
I'd pretend to be sleepin'
When you come in in the mornin'
To whisper goodbye
Go to work in the rain
I don't know why
Don't know why

[Chorus]
'Cause everyone's singin', we just wanna be heard
Disappearin' every day without so much as a word, somehow
Wanna grab a hold of that little songbird
Take her for a ride to the top of the world right now

[Outro]
Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh
To the top of the world
To the top of the world
To the top of the world
To the top of the world
To the top of the world
To the top of the world
To the top of the world
To the top of the world"
The Chicks,Godspeed (Sweet Dreams),"[Verse 1]
Dragon tales and the ""water is wide""
Pirates sail and lost boys fly
Fish bite moonbeams every night
And I love you

[Chorus]
Godspeed, little man
Sweet dreams, little man
Oh, my love will fly to you each night on angels wings
Godspeed, sweet dreams

[Verse 2]
The rocket racer's all tuckered out
Superman's in pajamas on the couch
Goodnight moon will find the mouse
And I love you

[Chorus]
Godspeed, little man
Sweet dreams, little man
Oh, my love will fly to you each night on angels wings
Godspeed, sweet dreams

[Verse 3]
God bless mommy and matchbox cars
God bless dad and thanks for the stars
God hears ""Amen,"" wherever we are
And I love you

[Chorus]
Godspeed, little man
Sweet dreams, little man
Oh, my love will fly to you each night on angels wings
Godspeed, sweet dreams"
Glen Campbell,Wichita Lineman,"[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I am a lineman for the county
And I drive the main road
Searchin' in the sun for another overload

[Chorus]
I hear you singing in the wire
I can hear you through the whine
And the Wichita lineman
Is still on the line
[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
I know I need a small vacation
But it don't look like rain
And if it snows that stretch down south
Won't ever stand the strain

[Chorus]
And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman
Is still on the line

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman
Is still on the line

Glen Campbell,Gentle On My Mind,"It's knowin' that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch

And it's knowin' I'm not shackled
By forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that are dried upon some line
That keeps you in the backroads
By the rivers of my memory
It keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or something that somebody said
Because they thought we fit together walkin'

It's just knowing that the world will not be cursing
Or forgiving when I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the backroads
By the rivers of my memory
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind
Though the wheat fields and the clotheslines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned, and I was gone

I still might run in silence, tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me 'til I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see you walkin' on the backroads
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind
I dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin'
Cracklin' caldron in some train yard
My beard a rough'nin', coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands 'round the tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're waitin' from the backroads
By the rivers of my memories
Ever smilin' ever gentle on my mind"
Glen Campbell,By the Time I Get to Phoenix,"[Verse 1]
By the time I get to Phoenix
She'll be risin'
She'll find the note I left hangin'
On her door
She'll laugh when she reads the part
That says I'm leavin'
'Cause I've left that girl so many times before

[Verse 2]
By the time I make Albuquerque
She'll be workin'
She'll prob'ly stop at lunch
And give me a call
But she'll just hear that phone keep on ringin'
Off the wall
That's all

[Verse 3]
By the time I make Oklahoma
She'll be sleepin'
She'll turn softly
And call my name out low
And she'll cry just to think I'd really leave her
Though time and time I've tried to tell her so
She just didn't know
I would really go"
Glen Campbell,Rhinestone Cowboy,"[Verse 1]
I've been walkin' these streets so long
Singin' the same old song
I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway
Where hustle's the name of the game
And nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain
There's been a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me

[Chorus]
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know
And offers comin' over the phone

[Verse 2]
Well, I really don't mind the rain
And a smile can hide all the pain
But you're down when you're ridin' the train that's takin' the long way
And I dream of the things I'll do
With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe
There'll be a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me

[Chorus]
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
Rhinestone cowboy
Gettin' cards and letters from people I don't even know
And offers comin' over the phone

[Bridge]
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo

[Fade]
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Gettin' card and letters from people I don't even know"
Glen Campbell,Southern Nights,"[Verse 1]
Southern nights
Have you ever felt a Southern night?
Free as a breeze
Not to mention the trees
Whistlin' tunes that you know and love so

[Verse 2]
Southern nights
Just as good even when closed your eyes
I apologize
To anyone who can truly say
That he has found a better way, hey, yeah

[Verse 3]
Southern skies
Have you ever noticed Southern skies? (In Southern sky)
Oh, its precious beauty lies just beyond the eye
It goes runnin' through your soul
Like the stories told of old

[Verse 4]
Old man
He and his dog that walk the old land
Every flower touched his cold hand
As he slowly walked by
Weepin' willows would cry for joy
Joy

[Verse 5]
Feels so good
Feels so good, it's frightening
Wish I could
Stop this world from fighting
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da

[Verse 6]
Mystery
Like this and many others in the trees
Blow in the night
In the Southern skies

[Verse 7]
Southern nights
They feel so good, it's a frightening
Wish I could (Southern nights)
Stop this world from the fighting

Glen Campbell,I’m Not Gonna Miss You,"I'm still here, but yet I'm gone
I don't play guitar or sing my songs
They never defined who I am
The man that loves you 'til the end
You're the last person I will love
You're the last face I will recall
And best of all, I'm not gonna miss you
Not gonna miss you

I'm never gonna hold you like I did
Or say I love you to the kids
You're never gonna see it in my eyes
It's not gonna hurt me when you cry
I'm never gonna know what you go through
All the things I say or do
All the hurt and all the pain
One thing selfishly remains
I'm not gonna miss you
I'm not gonna miss you"
Glen Campbell,Galveston,"[Verse 1]
Galveston, oh Galveston
I still hear your sea winds blowin'
I still see her dark eyes glowin'
She was twenty-one
When I left Galveston

[Verse 2]
Galveston, oh Galveston
I still hear your sea waves crashing
While I watch the cannons flashing
I clean my gun
And dream of Galveston

[Bridge]
I still see her standing by the water
Standing there lookin' out to sea
And is she waiting there for me?
On the beach where we used to run

[Verse 3]
Galveston, oh Galveston
I am so afraid of dying
Before I dry the tears she's crying
Before I watch
Your sea birds flying in the sun

[Outro]
At Galveston
At Galveston"
Glen Campbell,The Hand That Rocks the Cradle,"He got here red and wrinkled scared and cryin'
Then she took him up and held him to her breast
And he sure was glad to get what mama offered
Then he went to sleep and put his fears to rest

It didn't seem to matter what he needed
He could always count on mama to supply
And regardless of the sleep she might be losin'
He always found a twinkle in her eye

There ought to be a hall of fame for mamas
Creation's most unique and precious pearls
And heaven help us always to remember
That the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world

She taught him all the attributes of greatness
That she knew he couldn't learn away from home
And by the time she wore the cover off her bible
Her hair was gray and her little man was gone

There ought to be a hall of fame for mamas
Creation's most unique and precious pearls
And heaven help us always to remember
That the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world
Yes, the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world"
Glen Campbell,500 Miles (Away from Home),"If you miss the train I'm on
You will know that I am gone
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles
Lord I'm one, Lord I'm two, Lord I'm three, Lord I'm four
I'm 500 miles away from home
Not a shirt on my back
Not a penny to my name

Lord I can't go back this a'way
This a'way, this a'way, this a'way, this a'way
Lord I can't go back this a'way
Well, I'm walking these ties
With tears in my eyes

Trying to read a letter from my home
From my home, from my home, from my home, from my home
Trying to read a letter from my home

If this train's running right
I'll be home by Saturday night
I'm 500 miles away from home
Away from home, away from home, away from home, away from home
I'm 500 miles away from home"
Glen Campbell,Take My Hand for a While,"Take my hand for a while
Explain it to me once again
Just for the sake
Of my-why broken heart

Look into my eyes
And maybe I will understand
How love I counted on
Was never there

You see, I-I thought
That you might love me

So you caught me, it seems
Off balance with a heart so full
Of love and pretty dreams
That two should share

And so, I-I know
But please before you go

Take my hand for a while
Explain it to me once again
Just for the sake
Of my-why broken heart"
Glen Campbell,Less of Me,"Let me be a little kinder let me be a little blinder
To the faults of those about me let me praise a little more
Let me be when I am weary just a little bit more cheery
Think a little more of others and a little less of me mhmm mhmm

Let me be a little braver when temptation bits me waver
Let me strive a little harder to be all that I should be
Let me be a little meeker with the brother that is weaker
Let me think more of my neighbor and a little less of me mhmm mhmm

Let me be when I am weary just a little bit more cheery
Let me serve a little better those that I am striving for
Let me be a little meeker with the brother that is weaker
Think a little more of others and a little less of me mhmm mhmm"
Glen Campbell,Try a Little Kindness,"If you see your brother standing by the road
With a heavy load from the seeds he sowed
And if you see your sister falling by the way
Just stop and say you're goin' the wrong way
You've got to try a little kindness yes show a little kindness
Yes shine your light for everyone to see
And if you'll try a little kindness and you'll overlook the blindness
Of the narrow minded people on the narrow minded streets

Don't walk around the down and out lend a helping hand instead of doubt
And the kindness that you show every day will help someone along their way
You've got to try a little kindness...
You've got to try a little kindness..."
Glen Campbell,I Love My Truck,"[Verse 1]
Well, it'll just get you down
If you let life get to you
Cause everybody's saying something
None of it's true
Well, I just don't care
When them times get hard
Cause I got everything I need
Right out in my yard

[Chorus]
I love my truck
She's right outside
I ain't got much luck
But I sure got a ride
It don't matter who lived
It don't matter who lied
I got my truck right by my side

[Verse 2]
You got Sally and you got Sue
And I got a Chevrolet
She takes me home after work
Don't ever miss a day
She don't care what I am
She don't care what I ain't
But she ain't no cheap pickup
'Cause she just needs a couple coats of paint

[Chorus]
I love my truck
It's right outside
I ain't got much luck
But I sure got a ride
It don't matter who lived
It don't matter who lied
I've got my truck right by my side
Yeah

[Verse 3]
She don't care
If I don't work a lick
She'll start every time
If the choke don't stick
I know that she will never
Never doubt me
Cause she never leaves home without me

[Chorus]
You see, I love my truck
It's right outside
I ain't got much luck
But I sure got a ride
It don't matter who lived
It don't matter who lied
I've got my truck right by my side
I got my truck right by my side, yeah
I've got my truck right by my side"
Glen Campbell,"Yesterday, When I Was Young","Yesterday, when I was young
The taste of life was sweet
Like rain upon my tongue
I teased at life as if
It were a foolish game
The way an evening breeze
May tease a candle flame
The thousand dreams I dreamed
The splendid things I planned
I always built to last
On weak and shifting sand
I lived by night and shunned
The naked light of day
And only now I see
How the years have ran away
Chorus...
Yesterday, when I was young
There were so many songs
That waited to be sung
So many wild pleasures
Lay in store for me
And so much pain
My dazzled eyes refused to see
I ran so fast that time
And youth at last ran out
I never stopped to think
What life was all about
And every conversation
That I can now recall
Concerns itself with me
And nothing else at all
Yesterday, the moon was blue
And every crazy day
Brought something new to do
And I used my magic age
As if it were a wand
And never saw the waste
And emptiness beyond
The game of love I played
With arrogance and pride
And every flame I lit
So quickly, quickly died
The friends I made all seemed
Somehow to drift away
And only I am left
On stage to end the play
Repeat ..
There are so many songs in me
That won't be sung
I feel the bitter taste
Of tears upon my tongue
And The time has come for me
To pay for yesterday
When I was young"
Glen Campbell,The Four Horsemen,"And I saw the white horse, ridden by a man with bow and arrow
And he wore a golden crown and he rode a trail so narrow
And he went forth to conquer all the liars, thieves and cheaters
All the weavers of illusion; all the bigots and mistreaters
And the earth was shakin' like an old man's hand and the sun was black as mud
And the oceans moved across the land and the moon became as blood

And I saw the red horse and a rider with a saber
To take peace from all the earth, for destruction was his labor
And he rode out in anger to turn brother against brother
With poison for the nations to make them all kill one another
And the stars of heaven fell to earth like the fruit of a tree that's shaken
By an unkindly wind, to be ever more forsaken

And I saw the black horse and the rider with the balance
To separate the works of man; his vices from his talents
A measure of wheat for a penny, three measures of barley in kind
To divide the one from the many, but hurt not the oil and wine
And the heavens parted like a scroll, when it is rolled together
And the mountains were moved out of place like a whirlwind blows a feather

And I saw a pale horse, and Death was riding on him
And Hell was right behind him, and no mortal man outshone him
The kings of the earth and the mighty men; the glorious and greedy
Hid themselves in the blackest hole with the homeless and the needy
And some priests and some television preachers lay down with the vile unholy
And some senators and movie stars shared a cave with the meek and lowly
And they cried to the mountains

Fall on us! And hide us from the face of him
Fall on us! And hide us from the face
Hide us from the face of him

Fall on us! And hide us from the face of him
Fall on us! And hide us from the face
Hide us from the face of him"
Glen Campbell,I’ll Be Lucky Someday,"Feeling low feeling blue
All the troubles come my way
But I just won't worry
I'll be lucky someday

My money's gone, ain't got no friends
More debts than I can face
But I just won't worry
I'll be lucky someday

Let it rain, oh, let it pour
'Cause it just can't get worst no way
And I know maybe soon
My luck will change someday

The gal I love done said goodbye
She went on her marryin' way
But I just won't worry
I'll be lucky someday

I'll be lucky someday
Maybe I'll get lucky someday..."
Glen Campbell,Just Like Always,"Every year when this day rolls around
I think of the night we first tore up the town
And I wonder if you're laughing with your eyes glowing
Making pretty conversation with the wines flowing
I'm runnin' your place just like always
Just like always

Everyday at least one time
I look at your face in the back of my mind
When you're smiling at the ocean and your eyes shining
When your hair's a red river and it's all mine
For a thousand days just like always

Maybe someday I really will forget
I'll really learn to live again, I'll live without regret
But funny, isn't it? This man ain't laughing yet
Does love really last forever?
Does the ocean love the sunset every time?

Oh, I pass your street, I look both ways, so incomplete
And I think that I might see you but of course, I don't
And I wish that you would call me but I know you won't
And I love you anyway just like always
Just like always
Just like always
Just like, just like, just like always"
Glen Campbell,Old Toy Trains,"Little toy trains, little toy tracks
Little toy drums coming from a sack
Carried by a man dressed in white and red
Little boy, don't you think it's time you were in bed?

Close your eyes
Listen to the skies
All is calm, all is well
Soon you'll hear Kris Kringle and the jingle bells

Bringin' little toy trains and little toy tracks
Little toy drums coming from a sack
Carried by a man dressed in white and red
Little boy, don't you think it's time you were in bed?

So close your eyes
And listen to the skies
All is calm, all is well
Soon you'll hear Kris Kringle and the jingle bells

Bringin' little toy trains and little toy tracks
Little toy drums coming from a sack
Carried by a man dressed in white and red

Little boy, don't you think it's time you were in bed?"
Glen Campbell,Sunflower,"Sunflower, good morning
You sure do make it like a sunny day
Sunflower, fair warning
I'm gonna love you if you come my way

Now, if there's a chance that romance can find you
Better not find you looking the other way
Now, isn't it time you finally take it
Make it so real it steals your breath away
Hey hey hey

Sunflower, good morning
You sure do make it like a sunny time
Sun morning, good morning
And someday, child, I'm gonna make you mine

Well, if there's a chance that romance will find you

Sunflower, sweet morning
For every time I'm gonna make you mine"
Glen Campbell,Dreams of the Everyday Housewife,"[Verse 1]
She looks in the mirror, and stares at the wrinkles that
Weren't there yesterday
And thinks of the young man that she almost married
What would he think if he saw her this way?

[Verse 2]
She picks up her apron, in little girl fashion
As something comes into her mind
Then slowly starts dancing, remembering her girlhood
And all of the boys she had waiting in line

[Chorus]
Ah, such are the dreams of the everyday housewife
You see everywhere, anytime of the day
An everyday housewife who gave up the good life for me

[Verse 3]
The photograph album, she takes from the closet
And slowly turns the page
And carefully picks up the crumbling flower
The first one he gave her, now withered with age

[Verse 4]
She closes her eyes, and touches the house dress that
Suddenly disappears
And just for the moment, she's wearing the gown
That broke all their minds back so many years

[Chorus]
Ah, such are the dreams of the everyday housewife
You see everywhere, anytime of the day
An everyday housewife who gave up the good life for me

[Chorus]
Ah, such are the dreams of the everyday housewife
You see everywhere, anytime of the day
An everyday housewife who gave up the good life for me

[Chorus / Outro]
Ah, such are the dreams of the everyday housewife
You see everywhere, anytime of the day"
Glen Campbell,When All of God’s Singers Get Home,"What a song of delight in that city so bright
Will be wafted 'neath heaven's fair dome
How the ransomed will raise
Happy songs in his praise
When all of God's singers get home

When all of God's singers get home
Where never a sorrow will come
There'll be no place like heaven my home
When all of God's singers get home

As we sing here on Earth
Songs of sadness or mirth
'tis a foretaste of rapture to come
But our joy can't compare
With he glory up there
When all of God's singers get home

Having overcome sin, hallelujah amen
Will be heard in that land 'er the foam
Every heart will be light
And each face will be bright
When all of God's singers get home"
Glen Campbell,Blues (My Naughty Sweetie Gives to Me),"Now there are blues that you get from lonliness
There are blues that you get from pain
There're blues when you are lonely for your one and only

They're kind that I got on my mind
Blues there are all very meanest kind
All the blues my naughty sweetie gives to me
Oh, yeah

Oh, they're blues you get from women when you see 'em goin' swimmin' and you haven't got a bathin' suit yourself
There are blues that start to flicker when you had a lot of liquor and someone goes and takes it off the shelf
There are blues you get from sittin' on the dock, and you wonderin' if your little boat is gonna rock
Blues you keep a gettin' in a taxicab a pettin' every time you hear the meter jump the clock

And there are blues you get from cryin' when your uncle Will is dyin' and he afterwards forgets you in his will
There are blues you get from kisses when you are walkin' with the missus and another baby shouts, ""Hey!!""
Blues that kinda make you hop and really shake and shiver, kinda make you want to end it all in the river
Blues my naughty sweetie gives to me

Now there are blues you get from women when you see 'em goin' swimmin' and you haven't got a bathin' suit your own self

Blues you keep a gettin' in a taxicab a pettin' every time you hear the meter jump the clock

Just one more time!

Glen Campbell,Adiós,"Ran away from home when I was seventeen
To be with you on the California coast
Drinking margaritas all night in the old cantina
Out on the California coast

Don't think that I'm ungrateful
And don't look so morose
Adios, adios

We never really made it baby
But we came pretty close
Adios, adios

Going up north where the hills are winter green
I got to leave you on the California coast
Going where the water's clear and the air is cleaner
Than the California Coast
Our dreams of endless summers
Were just too grandiose
Adios, adios

And I'll miss the blood red sunset
But I'll miss you the most
Adios, adios
Adios, adios
Adios, adios"
Glen Campbell,Guess I’m Dumb,"[Verse 1]
The way I act don't seem like me
I'm not on top like I used to be
I'll give in when I know I should be strong
I still give in even though I know it's wrong
Know it's wrong

[Refrain]
I guess I'm dumb but I don't care

[Verse 2]
And breaking off wasn't hard to do
But I couldn't stay away from you
I feel love but not the way I did before (Guess I'm dumb)
This time, girl, has got to be forever more, ever more

[Refrain]
I guess I'm dumb but I don't care

[Orchestral Bridge]

[Verse 3]
And baby, since we've been apart

Maybe I've found I had a heart
I couldn't let go even if I wanted to
And you must know, baby, now it's only you
Only you

Glen Campbell,I Don’t Want to Know Your Name,"I see you just like the movies
I see your face
Across a crowded room
And I have learned through
Simple trial and error
Not to speak too soon

Your eyes just like a magnet
They're drawing my eyes around
And I can't hear one
Word of conversation
I can't hear a sound

I see you looking at me
You see me looking at you

[Chorus:]
I don't wanna know your name
And I don't wanna play this game
Where two lovers meet
And one lover parts in pain

I feel this urge to meet you
I feel this urge to run
Repairing hearts so easily shattered
Is never any fun

I see you looking at me
You see me looking at you

[Chorus:]
I don't wanna know your name
I don't wanna play this game
I don't wanna know your name
I don't wanna play this game"
Kris Kristofferson,Me and Bobby McGee,"[Verse 1]
Busted flat in Baton Rouge, headin' for the trains
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained
Took us all the way to New Orleans

[Verse 2]
I took my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna
And was blowin' sad while Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time and
Bobby clappin' hands we finally sang up every song
That driver knew

[Verse 3]
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee.

[Verse 4]
From the coalmines of Kentucky to the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Standin' right beside me, Lord, through everythin' I done
Every night she kept me from the cold

[Verse 5]
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord, I let her slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope she'll find
And I'd trade all my tomorrows for a single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine

[Verse 6]
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all she left for me
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee"
Kris Kristofferson,Why Me,"[Verse 1]
Why me Lord?
What have I ever done
To deserve even one
Of the pleasures I've known?
Tell me, Lord
What did I ever do
That was worth lovin' you
Or the kindness you've shown?

[Chorus]
Lord help me, Jesus
I've wasted it so help me, Jesus
I know what I am
But now that I know
That I've needed you so help me, Jesus
My soul's in your hand

[Verse 2]
Try me, Lord
If you think there's a way
I can try to repay
All I've taken from you
Maybe, Lord
I can show someone else
What I've been through myself
On my way back to you

[Chorus]
Lord help me, Jesus
I've wasted it so help me, Jesus
I know what I am
But now that I know
That I've needed you so help me, Jesus
My soul's in your hand
Lord help me, Jesus
I've wasted it so help me, Jesus
I know what I am
But now that I know
That I've needed you so help me, Jesus
My soul's in your hand

[Tag]
Jesus
My soul's in your hand"
Kris Kristofferson,Sunday Mornin’ Comin’ Down,"[Verse 1]
Well, I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head that didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad
So I had one more for dessert
Then I fumbled through my closet for my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face and combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day

[Verse 2]
I'd smoked my brain the night before
On cigarettes and songs that I'd been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at  a can that he was kickin'
Then I crossed the empty street
And caught the Sunday smell of someone fryin' chicken
And it took me back to somethin'
That I'd lost somehow, somewhere along the way

[Chorus]
On the Sunday morning sidewalks
Wishing, Lord, that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothin' short of dyin'
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleepin' city sidewalks
Sunday mornin' comin' down

[Verse 3]
In the park, I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl who he was swingin'
And I stopped beside a Sunday school
And listened to the song that they were singin'
Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringin'
And it echoed through the canyons
Like the disappearing dreams of yesterday

[Chorus]
On the Sunday morning sidewalks
Wishing, Lord, that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a Sunday
Makes a body feel alone
And there's nothin' short of dyin'
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleepin' city sidewalk
Sunday mornin' comin' down

[Outro]
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do"
Kris Kristofferson,Help Me Make It Through the Night,"[Intro]
Take the ribbon from your hair
Shake it loose and let it fall
Lay it soft upon my skin
Like the shadows on the wall
Come and lay down by my side
Till the early morning light
All I'm takin' is your time
Help me make it through the night
I don't care who’s right or wrong
I don't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
Lord, tonight I need a friend
Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be alone
Help me make it through the night

[Bridge]
I don't care what's right or wrong (Yes, I do!)
I don't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
Lord, tonight I need a friend
Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
Lord, it's bad to be alone
Help me make it through the night"
Kris Kristofferson,"The Pilgrim, Chapter 33","[Intro: Spoken]
I started writing a song about Chris Gentry and ended up writing about Dennis Hopper,  Johnny Cash... Norman, Norbert, Funky Donnie Fritts, Billy Swan, Bobby Neuwirth, Jerry Jeff Walker,  Paul Siebel…and Ramblin’ Jack Elliott had a lot to do with it

[Intro: Musical]

[Verse 1]
See him wasted on the sidewalk in his jacket and his jeans
Wearin' yesterday's misfortunes like a smile
Once he had a future full of money, love, and dreams
Which he spent like they was goin' outta style
And he keeps right on a-changin' for the better or the worse
Searchin' for a shrine, he's never found
Never knowin' if believin' is a blessin' or a curse
Or if the goin' up was worth the comin' down

[Chorus]
He's a poet and he's a picker, he's a prophet and he's a pusher
He's a pilgrim and a preacher and a problem when he's stoned
He's a walkin' contradiction, partly truth and partly fiction
Takin' every wrong direction on his lonely way back home

[Verse 2]
He has tasted good and evil in your bedrooms and your bars
And he's traded in tomorrow for today
Runnin' from his devils, Lord, and reachin' for the stars
And losin' all he's loved along the way
But if this world keeps right on turnin' for the better or the worse
And all he ever gets is older and around
From the rockin' of the cradle to the rollin' of the hearse
The goin' up was worth the comin' down

[Chorus]
He's a poet and he's a picker, he's a prophet and he's a pusher
He's a pilgrim and a preacher and a problem when he's stoned
He's a walkin' contradiction, partly truth and partly fiction
Takin' every wrong direction on his lonely way back home

[Outro]
There's a lot o' wrong directions on that lonely way back home"
Kris Kristofferson,Loving Her Was Easier (Than Anything I’ll Ever Do Again),"[Verse 1]
I have seen the morning burning golden on the mountain in the skies
Aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when she flies
Turning on the world the way she smiled upon my soul as I lay dying
Healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes

[Verse 2]
Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin
Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I've been
Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying
Talking of tomorrow and the money, love, and time we had to spend

[Chorus]
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again

[Verse 3]
Coming close together with a feeling that I've never known before in my time
She ain't ashamed to be a woman nor afraid to be a friend
I don't know the answer to the easy way she opened every door in my mind
But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end

[Chorus]
And loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again

[Outro]
Mmm, mmm
Ah"
Kris Kristofferson,For the Good Times,"[Verse 1]
Don't look so sad, I know it's over
But life goes on and this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges that we're burning

[Chorus]
Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops blowin' soft against the window
And make-believe you love me one more time
For the good times

[Verse 2]
I'll get along, you'll find another
And I'll be here if you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me

[Chorus]
Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops blowin' soft against the window
And make-believe you love me one more time
For the good times"
Kris Kristofferson,To Beat the Devil,"[Intro]
A couple of years back, I come across a
Great and wasted friend of mine in the hallway of a recording studio
And while he was reciting some poetry to me that he'd written
I saw that he was about a step away from dyin' and I couldn't help but wonder why
And, uh, the lines of this song occurred to me
I'm happy to say he's no longer wasted and he's got him a good woman
And I'd like to dedicate this to John and June
Who helped show me how to beat the devil

[Verse 1]
It was winter time in Nashville, down on Music City Row
And I was lookin' for a place to get myself out of the cold
To warm the frozen feelin' that was eatin' at my soul
Keep the chilly wind off my guitar
My thirsty wanted whisky, my hungry needed beans
But it'd been of month of paydays since I'd heard that eagle scream
So with a stomach full of empty and a pocket full of dreams
I left my pride and stepped inside a bar
Actually, I guess you'd call it a tavern
Cigarette smoke to the ceilin' and sawdust on the floor
Friendly shadows

[Verse 2]
I saw that there was just one old man sittin' at the bar
And in the mirror, I could see him checkin' me and my guitar
And he turned and said, ""Come up here, boy, and show us what you are""
I said ""I'm dry,"" and he bought me a beer
He nodded at my guitar and said, ""It's a tough life, ain't it?""
I just looked at him
He said, ""You ain't makin' any money, are you?""
I said, ""You've been readin' my mail""
He just smiled and said, ""Let me see that guitar
I got somethin' you oughta hear""
Then he laid it on me

[Chorus]
""If you waste your time a-talkin'
To the people who don't listen
To the things that you are sayin'
Who do you think's gonna hear?
And if you should die explainin' how
The things that they complain about
Are things they could be changin'
Who do you think's gonna care?""
There were other lonely singers in a world turned deaf and blind
Who were crucified for what they tried to show
And their voices have been scattered by the swirlin' winds of time
'Cause the truth remains that no one wants to know

[Verse 3]
Well, the old man was a stranger, but I'd heard his song before
Back when failure had me locked out on the wrong side of the door
When no one stood behind me but my shadow on the floor
And lonesome was more than a state of mind
You see, the devil haunts a hungry man
If you don't wanna join him, you gotta beat him
I ain't sayin' I beat the devil, but I drank his beer for nothing
Then I stole his song

[Chorus]
And you still can hear me singin'
To the people who don't listen
To the things that I am sayin'
Prayin' someone's gonna hear
And I guess I'll die explainin' how
The things that they complain about
Are things they could be changin'
Hopin' someone's gonna care
I was born a lonely singer and I'm bound to die the same
But I've gotta feed the hunger in my soul
And if I never have a nickel, I won't ever die ashamed
'Cause I don't believe that no one wants to know"
Kris Kristofferson,Casey’s Last Ride,"[Verse 1]
Casey joins the hollow sound of silent people walking down
The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below
Following their footsteps through the neon-darkened corridors
Of silent desperation, never speakin' to a soul

[Pre-Chorus]
The poison air he's breathin' has the dirty smell of dyin'
'Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain
But Casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes
Of the clickin' of the turnstiles and the rattle of his chains

[Chorus]
""Oh,"" she said, ""Casey it's been so long since I've seen you""
""Here,"" she said, ""just a kiss to make a body smile""
""See,"" she said, ""I've put on new stockings just to please you""
""Lord,"" she said, ""Casey can you only stay a while?""

[Verse 2]
Casey leaves the underground and stops inside the Golden Crown
For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bone
Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men
Who reach for anything they can to keep from goin' home

[Pre-Chorus]
Standin' in the corner, Casey drinks his pint of bitter
Never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by
Then he stumbles as he's leaving and he wonders if the reason
Is the beer that's in his belly or the tear that's in his eye

[Chorus]
""Oh,"" she said, ""I suppose you seldom think about me""
""Now,"" she said, ""Now that you've a family of your own""
""Still,"" she said, ""it's so blessed good to feel your body""
""Lord,"" she said, ""Casey, it's a shame to be alone"""
Kris Kristofferson,Sister Sinead,"I'm singing this song for my sister Sinead
Concerning the god awful mess that she made
When she told them her truth just as hard as she could
Her message profoundly was misunderstood

There's humans entrusted with guarding our gold
And humans in charge of the saving of souls
And humans responded all over the world
Condemning that bald headed brave little girl

And maybe she's crazy and maybe she ain't
But so was Picasso and so were the saints
And she's never been partial to shackles or chains
She's too old for breaking and too young to tame

It's askin' for trouble to stick out your neck
In terms of a target a big silhouette
But some candles flicker and some candles fade
And some burn as true as my sister Sinead

And maybe she's crazy and maybe she ain't
But so was Picasso and so were the saints
And she's never been partial to shackles or chains
She's too old for breaking and too young to tame"
Kris Kristofferson,Don’t Let the Bastards Get You Down,"They're killing babies in the name of Freedom
We've been down that sorry road before
They let us hang around a little longer than they should have
And it's too late to fool us anymore

We've seen the ones who killed the ones with vision
Cold-blooded murder right before your eyes
Today they hold the power and the money and the guns
It's getting hard to listen to their lies

Chorus:
And I've just got to wonder what my Daddy would've done
If he'd seen the way they turned his dream around
I've got to go by what he told me, try to tell the truth
And stand your ground
DON'T LET THE BASTARDS GET YOU DOWN

Mining roads
Killing farmers
Burning down schools full of children
Fighting communism

Chorus:
And I've just got to wonder what my Daddy would've done
If he'd seen the way they turned his dream around
I've got to go by what he told me, try to tell the truth
And stand your ground
DON'T LET THE BASTARDS GET YOU DOWN"
Kris Kristofferson,The Law Is for Protection of the People,"[Verse 1]
Billy Dalton staggered on the sidewalk
Someone said he stumbled and he fell
Six squad cars came screamin' to the rescue
Hauled old Billy Dalton off to jail

[Chorus]
'Cause the law is for protection of the people
Rules are rules and any fool can see
We don't need no drunks like Billy Dalton
Scarin' decent folks like you and me
No siree

[Verse 2]
Homer Lee Hunnicut was nothin' but a hippy (Homer Lee Hunnicut)
Walkin' through this world without a care
Then one day, six strappin' brave policeman
Held down Homer Lee and cut his hair

[Chorus]
'Cause the law is for protection of the people
Rules are rules and any fool can see
We don't need no hairy-headed hippies
Scarin' decent folks like you and me
No siree

[Verse 3]
Oh, so thank your lucky stars you've got protection
Walk the line and never mind the cost
And don't wonder who them lawmen was protectin'
When they nailed the Savior to the cross

[Chorus]
'Cause the law is for protection of the people
Rules are rules and any fool can see
We don't need no riddle-speakin' prophets
Scarin' decent folks like you and me
No siree"
Kris Kristofferson,The Silver Tongued Devil and I,"I took myself down to the Tally Ho Tavern
To buy me a bottle of beer
And I sat me down by a tender young maiden
Who's eyes were as dark as her hair
And as I was searching from bottle to bottle
For something un-foolish to say
That silver tongued devil just slipped from the shadows
And smilingly stole her away
I said: ""Hey, little girl, don't you know he's the devil
He's everything that I ain't
Hiding intentions of evil
Under the smile of a saint
All he's good for is getting in trouble
And shiftin' his share of the blame
And some people swear he's my double:
And some even say we're the same""
But the silver-tongued devil's got nothing to lose
I'll only live 'til I die
We take our own chances and pay our own dues
The silver tongued devil and I

Like all the fair maidens who've laid down beside him
She knew in her heart that he'd lied
Nothin' that I could have said could have saved her
No matter how hard that she tried
'Cos she'll offer her charms to the darkness and danger
Of somethin' that she's never known
And open her arms at the smile of a stranger
Who'll love her and leave her alone

And you know, he's the devil
He's everything that I ain't
Hiding intentions of evil
Under the smile of a saint
All he's good for is getting in trouble
And shiftin' his share of the blame
And some people swear he's my double:
And some even say we're the same
But the silver-tongued devil's got nothing to lose
I'll only live 'til I die
We take our own chances and pay our own dues
Ah ha ha ha

The silver tongued devil and I"
Kris Kristofferson,Best of All Possible Worlds,"I was runnin' through the summer rain
Tryin' to catch the evenin' train
And kill that old familiar pain
Weavin' through my tangled brain
When I tipped my bottle back
I smacked into a cop I didn't see

That policeman said Mr. Cool
If you're ain't drunk then you're a fool
I said if that's against the law
Tell me why I never saw
A man locked in that jail of yours
Who wasn't just as lowdown poor as me

Well that was when someone turned out the lights
And I wound up in jail to spend the night
And dream of all the wine and lonely girls
In this best of all possible worlds

Well I woke up next morning
Feelin' like my head was gone
And like my thick old tongue
Was lickin' somethin' sick and wrong
And I told that man I'd sell my soul
For somethin' wet and cold as that old cell

That kindly jailer grinned at me
All eaten up with sympathy
Then poured himself another beer
And came and whispered in my ear
'If booze was just a dime a bottle
Boy, you couldn't even buy the smell'

I said I knew there was somethin' I liked about this town
But it takes more than that to bring me down down down
'Cause there's still a lot of wine and lonely girls
In this best of all possible worlds

Well they finally came and told me
They was a-gonna set me free
And I'd be leavin' town
If I knew what was good for me
I said it's nice to learn that
Everybody's so concerned about my health

I said I won't be leavin'
No more quicker than I can
'Cause I've enjoyed about as much of this
As I can stand
And I don't need this town of yours
More than I've never needed nothing else

'Cause there's still a lotta drinks that I ain't drunk
Lots of pretty thoughts that I ain't thunk, oh yeah
Lord there's still so many lonely girls
In this best of all possible worlds"
Kris Kristofferson,Billy Dee,"Billy Dee was seventeen when he turned twenty-one
Fooling with some foolish things he could've left alone
But he had to try to satisfy a thirst he couldn't name
Driven toward the darkness by the devils in his veins

All around the honky-tonks, searching for a sign
Gettin' by on gettin' high on women, words and wine
Some folks called him crazy, Lord, and others called him free
But we just called us lucky for the love of Billy Dee

Busy goin' his own way and speakin' his own words
Facin' and forgettin' every warnin' that he heard
Makin' friends and takin' any crazy chance he could
Gettin' busted for the bad times and believin' in the good

Billy took a beatin' from a world he meant no harm
The score was written in the scars upon his arm
Some felt he was payin' for the life he tried to lead
But all we felt was sorry for our good friend Billy Dee

It may be his soul was bigger than a body's ought to be
Singin' songs and bringin' laughter to the likes of you and me
'Cause the world he saw was sadder than the one he hoped to find
But it wasn't near as lonesome as the one he left behind

Yesterday they found him on the floor of his hotel
Reachin' toward the needle, Lord, that drove him down to hell
Some folks called it suicide, others blame the speed
But we just called it crucified when Billy Dee O.D.'d"
Kris Kristofferson,Hellacious Acres,"Look who's advertising
Billboards everywhere
See hellacious acres
Your tailor-made nightmare
Traffic is backed up for miles
Attendants welcome you with devilish smiles

Steady, steady
Have your tickets ready
Steady, steady

Go to hell after dark
It's a sin-filled city, an amusement park
It's a one-way ticket to the other side
It's a Dr. Jekyll and a Mr. Hyde
And see Lizzie Borden, she's one of the stars
And tricky Dickie barkin', flashin' you his pardon
Oh, Jack The Ripper slashin' your tires

Oh, even the Devil needs money
Even the President need money
To cover his overhead
That's why he opened hellacious acres
Or so his press agent said
Hang out with heavies, your partners in crime
Forget the consequences, have a good time

Steady, steady
Have your tickets ready
Steady, steady

Go to hell after dark
It's a sin-filled city, an amusement park
It's a one-way ticket to the other side
It's a Dr. Jekyll, it's a Mr. Hyde
And get down and study, suspicion and doubt
At hellacious acres, listen, mischief makers
Admission's free, you pay to get out

Uh-huh-huh"
Kris Kristofferson,Jesus Was a Capricorn (Owed to John Prine),"[Verse 1]
Jesus was a Capricorn, he ate organic foods
He believed in love and peace and never wore no shoes
Long hair, beard and sandles and a funky bunch of friends
Reckon they'd just nail him up, if he come down again

[Chorus]
'Cause everybody's gotta have somebody to look down on
Prove they can feel better than at any time they please
Someone doin' somethin' dirty decent folks can frown on
If you can't find nobody else, then help yourself to me

[Verse 2]
Eggheads cussin', rednecks cussin' hippies for their hair
Others laugh at straights who laugh at freaks who laugh at squares
Some folks hate the Whites who hate the Blacks who hate the Klan
Most of us hate anything we don't understand

[Chorus]
'Cause everybody's gotta have somebody to look down on
Prove they can feel better than at any time they please
Someone doin' somethin' dirty decent folks can frown on
If you can't find nobody else, then help yourself to me

Help yourself right on
Help yourself, Jim
Help yourself, Reverend"
Kris Kristofferson,Here Comes That Rainbow Again,"[Verse 1]
The scene was a small roadside café
The waitress was sweepin' the floor
Two truck drivers drinkin' their coffee
And two Okie kids by the door
""How much are them candies?"" they asked her
""How much have you got?"" she replied
""We've only a penny between us""
""Them's two for a penny,"" she lied

[Chorus]
And the daylight grew heavy with thunder
With the smell of the rain on the wind
Ain't it just like a human?
Here comes that rainbow again

[Verse 2]
One truck driver called to the waitress
After the kids went outside
""Them candies ain't two for a penny""
""So what's it to you?"" she replied
In silence, they finished their coffee
And got up and nodded goodbye
She called, ""Hey, you left too much money""
""So what's it to you?"" they replied

[Chorus]
And the daylight was heavy with thunder
With the smell of the rain on the wind
Ain't it just like a human?
Here comes that rainbow again"
Kris Kristofferson,Watch Closely Now,"[Intro]
Okay folks, the John Norman Howard Speedway
Watch closely now
You'll observe a curious exchange of energy
Are you a figment of my imagination
Or am I one of yours?

[Verse 1]
Watch closely now
Are you watching me now
Your eyes are like fingers
They're touching my body
And arousing my soul
Riding the passion arising inside me
How high can I go?
You're comin' with me, girl
I'm gonna show you how
When it's scary
Don't look down

[Verse 2]
Watch closely now
Are you watching me now?
I see the hunger arise in your eyes
And it's urging me on
Higher and harder and faster and farther
Than I've ever gone
We're coming closer, lady
Don't ya leave me now
We're gonna make it
Don't look down

[Bridge]
Maybe I'm takin' me too many chances
With no net at all
Maybe I'll teach you at least
That you've got to be free when you fall

[Verse 3]
Watch closely now
Are you watching me now?
I'm the master magician
Who's setting you free
From the lies you've been told
When they're breaking your back?
Bring your last straw to me
I turn straw into gold
I'm gonna need you later
When you're not around
But I can take it
Don't look down

[Outro]
Watch closely now
Are you watching me now?"
Kris Kristofferson,From the Bottle to the Bottom,"You ask me if I'm happy now
That's good as any joke I've heard
It seems since I've seen you last
I done forgot the meanin' of the words
If happiness is empty rooms
And drinkin' in the afternoon
Well I suppose I'm happy as a clown
But if it's got a thing to do
With smilin' of forgettin' you
Well I don't guess that I could say I am

Did you ever see a down and outer waking up alone
Without a blanket on to keep him from the dew
When the water from the weeds it soaked the papers
He been puttin' in his shoes to keep the ground from coming through
And his future feels as empty as the pockets in his pants
Because he's never seen a single dream come true
That's the way that I've been feeling since the day I started falling
From the bottle to the bottom stool by stool
Learning hard to live with losin' you

You wonder if I'm better off
With freedom now to do the things I choose
With all my times my own and
I got nothing left but sleeping time to lose
There's no one here to carry on
If I stay out the whole night long
Or give a tankerous damn if I don't call
I'm living like I wanted to
And doing things I wanna do
And nothing means a thing to me at all

Did you ever see a down and outer waking up alone
Without a blanket on to keep him from the dew
When the water from the weeds it soaked the papers
He been puttin' in his shoes to keep the ground from coming through
And his future feels as empty as the pockets in his pants
Because he's never seen a single dream come true
That's the way that I've been feeling since the day I started falling
From the bottle to the bottom stool by stool
Learning hard to live with losin' you"
Kris Kristofferson,The Taker,"{Intro}
He's a giver, he'll give her
The kind of attention that she's never known
He's a teacher, he'll teacher her
To open the doors that she can't on her own
He's a lover, he'll love her
In ways that she never has been loved before
And he's a getter, he'll get her
By gettin' her into the world she's been hungryin' for

He's a charmer, and he'll charm her
With money and manners that I never learned
He's a leader, and he'll lead her
Across pretty bridges he's planning to burn
He's a talker, he'll talk her
Right off of her feet, but he won't talk for long
Cause he's a doer, and he'll do her
The way that I've never
And damned if he won't do her wrong

Cause he's a taker, he'll take her
To places and make her fly higher than she's ever dared to
He'll take his time before takin' advantage
Takin' her easy and slow
And after he's taken the body and soul
That she gives him, he'll take her for granted
Then he'll take off and leave her
Takin' all of her pride as he goes

Cause he's a taker, he'll take her
To places and make her fly higher than she's ever dared to
He'll take his time before takin' advantage
Takin' her easy and slow
And after he's taken the body and soul
That she gives him, he'll take her for granted
Then he'll take off and leave her
Takin' all of her pride as he goes

Kris Kristofferson,Jody and the Kid,"[Verse 1]
She would meet me in the mornin', on my way down to the river
Waitin' patient by the Chinaberry tree
With her feet already dusty, from the pathway to the levee
And her little blue jeans rolled up to her knees

[Verse 2]
I'd pay her no attention, as she tagged along beside me
Tryin' hard to copy everything I did
But I couldn't keep from smilin' when I'd hear somebody sayin'
Looky yonder there goes Jody and the kid

[Verse 3]
Even after we grew older, we could still be seen together
As we walked along the levee holdin' hands
For as surely as the seasons, she was changin' to a woman
And I'd lived enough to call myself a man

[Verse 4]
And she often lay beside me, in the coolness of the evenin'
'Til the mornin' sun was shinin' on my bed
And at times when she was sleepin', I would smile when I'd remember
How they use to call us Jody and the kid

[Verse 5]
Now the world's a little older, and the years have changed the river
'Cause there's houses where they didn't used to be
And on Sundays, I go walkin' down the pathway to the levee
With another little girl who follows me

[Verse 6]
And it makes the old folks smile, to see her tag along beside me
Doin' little things the way her mama did
But it gets a little lonesome when I hear somebody sayin'
Looky yonder, there goes Jody and the kid"
Kris Kristofferson,They Killed Him,"There was a man named Mahatma Ghandi
He would not bow down, he would not fight
He knew the deal was down and dirty
And nothing wrong could make it right away

But he knew his duty, and the price he had to pay
Just another holy man who tried to make a stand
MY GOD, THEY KILLED HIM !

Another man from Atlanta, Georgia
By the name of Martin Luther King
He shook the land like rolling thunder
And made the bells of freedom ring today

With a dream of beauty that they could not burn away
Just another holy man who dared to be a friend
MY GOD, THEY KILLED HIM !

The only son of God Almighty
The holy one called Jesus Christ
Healed the lame and fed the hungry
And for his love they took his life away

On the road to glory where the story never ends
Just the holy son of man we'll never understand
MY GOD, THEY KILLED HIM !

Sing about Mahatma Ghandi
Sing of Martin Luther King
Sing Of Jesus Christ Almighty
And the brothers Kennedy"
Kris Kristofferson,Good Morning John,"Good Morning, John!
Ain't it great to see your future shining brighter in the naked light of day?
Ain't it great to see your future shining brighter than the naked light of day?

You made it, son!
But I confess there was a time or two I thought that you might let it slip away

I love you, John!
In the cold and holy darkness you were always shining brighter than a star

God bless you, John!
For the love and joy you've given and the living inspiration that you are

You've scared me, John!
Cause you crossed so many borders into danger with a price upon your head

They got you, John!
And it hurts to see so many friends, who ran along beside you lying dead

I know you, John!
There ain't nothing you can't handle now, cause there ain't nothing bigger than your heart
There ain't nothing you can't handle out there ain't nothing bigger than your heart

Keep shining, John!
Keep smiling, John!
For you owe it to the others and the dark and holy wonder that you are

Hang in there, John!
It's a rocky role to glory, but the strangest and strongest will survive

Keep smiling, John!
We'll both make it there tomorrow but today lets say we're lucky we're alive
We won't make it there tomorrow, but today let's say we're lucky we're alive

I'll see you John!
Though the best of good intentions have a way of gettin' scattered by the wind

I know you, John!
There ain't nothing you can't handle now, cause there ain't nothing bigger than your heart

I'm leavin' John!
You can lose your mind and mem'ry but you ain't gonna lose me as your friend
I love you, John
You can lose your mind or memory, but you'll never lose me as your friend

Good morning, John!
(Good morning John...)"
Kris Kristofferson,Blame It on the Stones,"[Verse 1]
Mister Marvin Middle Class is really in a stew
Wonderin' what the younger generation's coming to
And the taste of his martini doesn't please his bitter tongue
Blame it on the Rolling Stones

You'll feel so much better knowing you don't stand alone
Join the accusations
Save the bleeding nation
Get it off your shoulders, blame it on the Stones

Mother tells the ladies at the bridge club every day
Of the rising price of tranquilizers she must pay
And she wonders why the children never seem to stay at home
Blame it on the Rolling Stones

Blame it on the Stones (Yes, that's [beauty?] for you)
Blame it on the Stones
You'll feel so much better knowing you don't stand alone
Join the accusations

Get it off your shoulders, blame it on the Stones

[Verse 3]
Father's at the office nightly, working all the time
Trying to make the secretary change her little mind
And it bothers him to read about so many broken homes
Blame it on those Rolling Stones

Blame it on the Stones (Get it together, children!)
Blame it on the Stones (You'll feel so much better, children)
You'll feel so much better knowing you don't stand alone (You'll be purified)
Join the accusations (Be crucified)
Save the bleeding nation (Blame it on the Stones)
Get it off your shoulders, blame it on the Stones"

Shine on the one who's gone and proved untrue

Bill Monroe,In The Pines,"The longest train I ever saw
Went down that Georgia line
The engine passed at six o'clock
And the cab passed by at nine

In the pines, in the pines
Where the sun never shines
And we shiver when the cold wind blows

I asked my captain for the time of day
He said he throwed his watch away
A long steel rail and a short cross tie
I'm on my way back home

Little girl, little girl, what have I done
That makes you treat me so
You caused me to weep, you caused me to mourn
You caused me to leave my home

My father was an engineer
Died a mile out of town
His head was found in the driving gear
But his body was never found"
Bill Monroe,Mule Skinner Blues,"Good morning captain good morning son
Do you need another mule skinner
Out on your new road line

Well I like to work I'm rolling all the time
Lord I like to work boy I'm rolling all the time
I can pop my initials Right on a mule's behind

Well it's hey little water boy bring your water 'round
Lord it's hey little water boy bring your water 'round
And if you don't like your job just set that water bucket down

I work out on the new road from a dollar and a dime a day
Lord I work out on the new road I make a dollar and a dime a day
I've got three women on Saturday night Waiting to draw my pay

Well I'm going to town honey what can I bring you back
Well I'm going to town baby what can I bring you back
Just bring a pint of good rye And a John B.Stetson hat

Lord it's raining here and it's storming on the deep blue sea
Lord it's raining here and it's storming on the deep blue sea
Can't no blonde headed woman make a monkey out for me

If your house catches fire and there ain't no water 'round
If your house catches fire and there ain't no water 'round
Just throw your good gal out the window let your house just burn on down

Well I'm leaving here and I ain't gonna take no clothes
I'm leaving here and I ain't gonna take no clothes
There may be good times in this old town but it's better on down the road"
Bill Monroe,I’ll Meet You In The Morning,"[Verse 1]
I'll meet you in the morning by the bright riverside
When all sorrow has drifted away
I'll be standin' at the portals when the gates open wide
At the close of life's long weary day

[Chorus]
I'll meet you in the morning with a how do you do
And we'll sit down by the river and when rapture of the planet renewed
You'll know me in the morning by the smile that I wear
When I meet you in the morning in the city that is built four square

[Verse 2]
I will meet you in the morning in the sweet by and by
And exchange the old cross for a crown
There will be no disappointments and nobody shall die
In that land when life's sun goeth down

[Chorus]
I'll meet you in the morning with a how do you do
And we'll sit down by the river and when rapture of the planet renewed
You'll know me in the morning by the smile that I wear
When I meet you in the morning in the city that is built four square"
Bill Monroe,Turkey in the Straw,"[Verse 1]
Well, I had an old hen and she had a wooden leg
Just the best old hen that ever laid and egg
She laid more eggs than any hen on the farm
But another little drink wouldn't do her any harm

[Chorus]
Turkey in the hay, in the hay, hay, hay!
Turkey in the straw, in the straw, straw, straw!
Pick 'em up, shake 'em up, any way at all
And hit up a tune called 'Turkey in the Straw'

[Verse 2]
Well, I hitched up the wagon and I drove down the road
With a two horse wagon and a four horse load
Well I cracked my whip and the lead horse sprung
And I said ""Goodbye"" to the wagon tongue

[Chorus]
Turkey in the hay, in the hay, hay, hay!
Turkey in the straw, in the straw, straw, straw!
Pick 'em up, shake 'em up, any way at all
And hit up a tune called 'Turkey in the Straw'

[Verse 3]
Well, if frogs had wings and snakes had hair
And automobiles went flyin' through the air
Well, if watermelons grew on a huckleberry vine
We'd still have winter in the summer time

[Chorus]
Turkey in the hay, in the hay, hay, hay!
Turkey in the straw, in the straw, straw, straw!
Pick 'em up, shake 'em up, any way at all
And hit up a tune called 'Turkey in the Straw'

[Verse 4]
Oh, I went out to milk and I didn't know how
I milked an old goat instead of a cow
A monkey sittin' there on a pile of straw
A-winkin' his eyes at his mother-in-law

[Chorus]
Turkey in the hay, in the hay, hay, hay!
Turkey in the straw, in the straw, straw, straw!
Pick 'em up, shake 'em up, any way at all
And hit up a tune called 'Turkey in the Straw'

[Verse 5]
Well, I come to the river and I couldn't get across
So I paid five dollars for an old blind horse
Well, he wouldn't go ahead and he wouldn't stand still
So he went up and down like an old saw mill

[Chorus]
Turkey in the hay, in the hay, hay, hay!
Turkey in the straw, in the straw, straw, straw!
Pick 'em up, shake 'em up, any way at all
And hit up a tune called 'Turkey in the Straw'"
Bill Monroe,Footprints in the Snow,"[Verse 1]
Now some folks like the summertime when the they can walk about
Strolling through the meadow green it's pleasant there no doubt
But give me the wintertime when the snow is on the ground
For I found her when the snow was on the ground

[Chorus]
I traced her little footprints in the snow
I found her little footprints in the snow, Lord
I bless that happy day that Nellie lost her way
For I found her when the snow was on the ground

[Verse 2]
I dropped in to see her there was a big round moon
Her mother said she just stepped out but would be returning soon
I found her little footprints and I traced them through the snow
I found her when the snow was on the ground

[Chorus]
I traced her little footprints in the snow
I found her little footprints in the snow, Lord
I bless that happy day that Nellie lost her way
For I found her when the snow was on the ground

[Verse 3]
Now she's up in heaven, she's with the angel band
I know I'm going to meet her in that promised land
But every time the snow falls it brings back memories
For I found her when the snow was on the ground

[Chorus]
I traced her little footprints in the snow
I found her little footprints in the snow, Lord
I bless that happy day that Nellie lost her way
For I found her when the snow was on the ground"

Bill Monroe,Uncle Pen,"Oh the people would come from far away
They'd dance all night till the break of day
When the caller hollered ""do-se-do""
You knew Uncle Pen was ready to go

Late in the evening about sundown
High on the hill and above the town
Uncle Pen played the fiddle lord how it would ring
You could hear it talk, you could hear it sing

He played an old piece he called ""Soldier's Joy""
And the one called ""The Boston Boy""
The greatest of all was ""Jenny Lynn""
To me that's where the fiddle begins

Late in the evening about sundown
High on the hill and above the town
Uncle Pen played the fiddle lord how it would ring
You could hear it talk, you could hear it sing

I'll never forget that mournful day
When Uncle Pen was called away
They hung up his fiddle, they hung up his bow
They knew it was time for him to go

Late in the evening about sundown
High on the hill and above the town
Uncle Pen played the fiddle lord how it would ring
You could hear it talk, you could hear it sing

Late in the evening about sundown
High on the hill and above the town
Uncle Pen played the fiddle lord how it would ring
You could hear it talk, you could hear it sing"
Bill Monroe,A Good Woman’s Love,"I was a rover, on land and on sea
'til a good woman's love made a new man of me
Life had no meaning, it was so incomplete
'til a good woman's love put me back on my feet

Still a-roamin' I go home in the evening and she's waiting there
And I know that no matter what happens she'll always care
And when night falls and the moon shines above
I'm a man with a dream and a good woman's love"
Bill Monroe,Little Cabin Home On The Hill,"Tonight I'm alone without you my dear
It seems there's a longing for you still
All I have to do now is sit alone and cry
In our little cabin home on the hill

Oh, someone has taken you from me
And left me here all alone
Just to listen to the rain beat on my window pane
In our little cabin home on the hill

I hope you are happy tonight as you are
But in my heart there's a longing for you still
I just keep it there so I won't be alone
In our little cabin home on the hill

And find there's no more happiness for you
Just let you thoughts turn back once more if you will
To our little cabin home on the hill"

Bill Monroe,"Lord, Build Me A Cabin In Gloryland","Many years I've been lookin' for a place to call home
But I still didn't find it so I must travel on
I don't care for the fine mansions on earth's sinkin sand

In the shade of his tree of life that it may ever stand
Where I can hear the angels and shake Jesus' hand

For I know that I'm not worthy of such splendor as this
When I ask Him for mercy while humbly I stand

On the grapevine of mournin' shall I hear them all say
Come and join in the singin' and play in our band

Bill Monroe,In Despair,"You made me love you, you made me want you
And now I need you all the time
My heart is sad and I'm so lonely
Each night and day you're on my mind

You broke me heart my little darling
When I called for you, you had another there

You made me forget of all the past
And I thought sweetheart you really loved me
My friends told me it would never last"

What kind of spirit lives in a fiddle
Well, it's old Satan, right there a waiting
Or are you tuned with the angel band

Well, you back up and push
Back up and push
Back up and push
Back off of sin and let Glory in
You can't go wrong singing this song
Back up and push away

Prepare to suffer the consequences
The foolish measure of the worldly pleasure
Can only drag you to the roaring fire

Back off of sin and let Glory in
You can't go wrong singing this song
Back up and push away"

In that beautiful Kentucky waltz"

Let the light shine down on me

Let the light shine down
Let the light shine down
Let the light shine down so I can see
There's a lesson I must learn
There's some bridges I must burn

Those that follow Him eternal life shall win
He died to set us free
If you trust and believe his blessing you'll receive
Let the light shine down on me

Let the light shine down
Let the light shine down
Let the light shine down so I can see
There's a lesson I must learn
There's some bridges I must burn
Let the light shine down on me

I have heard folks say that there will come a day
When He'll drag all the rocks to fall
The worlds in darkness bounds in the light somehow
Let the light shine down on us all

Let the light shine down
Let the light shine down
Let the light shine down so I can see
There's a lesson I must learn
There's some bridges I must burn
Let the light shine down on me"

Bill Monroe,Columbus Stockade Blues,"Way down in Columbus, Georgia
Want to be back in Tennessee
Way down in Columbus Stockade
Friends all turned their backs on me

Go and leave me if you wish to
Never let it cross your mind
If in your heart you love another
Leave me little darling, I don't mind

Last night as I lay sleeping
I dreamt I held you in my arms
When I awoke I was mistaken
I was peering through the bars

Many a night with you I've rambled
Many an hour with you I've spent
Thought I had your heart forever
Now I find it's only lent"
Bill Monroe,It’s Mighty Dark To Travel,"It's mighty dark for me to travel
For my sweetheart she is gone
The road is rough and filled with gravel
But I must journey on and on

To me she was a little angel
Sent down to me from God above
And on the day that I first met her
Then I told her of my love

Many a night we strolled together
Talking of our love so fair
My love for her will never vanish
Oh I know I'll meet her there

Traveling down this lonesome highway
Thinking of my love who's gone
Knowing soon we'll be together
She's the only love I've known"
Chris Stapleton,Tennessee Whiskey,"[Verse 1]
Used to spend my nights out in a barroom
Liquor was the only love I'd known
But you rescued me from reachin' for the bottom
And brought me back from bein' too far gone

[Chorus]
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

[Verse 2]
I've looked for love in all the same old places
Found the bottom of a bottle's always dry
But when you poured out your heart, I didn't waste it
'Cause there's nothin' like your love to get me high

[Chorus]
And you're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

[Outro]
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey, Tennessee whiskey
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey, Tennessee whiskey"
Chris Stapleton,Fire Away,"[Verse 1]
Honey, load up your questions
And pick up your sticks and your stones
And pretend I'm a shelter
For heartaches that don't have a home

[Pre-Chorus]
And choose the words that cut like a razor
And all that I'll say, is...

[Chorus]
Fire away
Take your best shot
Show me what you got
Honey, I'm not afraid
Rear back and take aim
And fire away

[Verse 2]
Well, I wish I could say
That I've never been here before
But you know and I know
That I'll always come back for more

[Pre-Chorus]
Your love might be my damnation
But I'll cry to my grave

[Chorus]
Fire away
Take your best shot
Show me what you got
Honey, I'm not afraid
Rear back and take aim
And fire away
Aww, fire away
Take your best shot
Show me what you got
Honey, I'm not afraid
Rear back and take aim
And fire away

[Outro]
Fire away
Aww, fire away
Fire away"
Chris Stapleton,Starting Over,"[Verse 1]
Well, the road rolls out like a welcome mat
To a better place than the one we're at
And I ain't got no kinda plan
But I've had all of this town I can stand

[Verse 2]
And I got friends out on the coast
We can jump in the water and see what floats
We've been savin' for a rainy day
Let's beat the storm and be on our way

[Pre-Chorus]
And it don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And, honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice

[Chorus]
I can be your lucky penny
You can be my four-leaf clover
Startin' over

[Verse 3]
This might not be an easy time
There's rivers to cross and hills to climb
Some days, we might fall apart
And some nights might feel cold and dark

[Verse 4]
But nobody wins afraid of losin'
And the hard roads are the ones worth choosin'
Someday, we'll look back and smile
And know it was worth every mile

[Pre-Chorus]
And it don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And, honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice

[Chorus]
I can be your lucky penny
You can be my four-leaf clover
Startin' over
Startin' over

It don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be

You can be my four-leaf clover
Startin' over
Startin' over

Chris Stapleton,Either Way,"[Verse 1]
We pass in the hall
On our way to separate rooms
The only time we ever talk
Is when the monthly bills are due

[Pre-Chorus]
We go to work, we go to church
We fake the perfect life
I'm past the point of give a damn
And all my tears are cried

[Chorus]
We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
But I won't love you either way

[Verse 2]
It's been so long since I've felt
Anything inside these walls
You can't hate and you can't hurt
When you don't feel at all

[Pre-Chorus]
I used to cry and stay up nights
And wonder what went wrong
And it's been hard
But hearts can only do that for so long

[Chorus]
We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
I won't love you either way

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
But I won't love you either way"
Chris Stapleton,You Should Probably Leave,"[Verse 1]
I know it ain't all that late
But you should probably leave
And I recognize that look in your eyes
Yeah, you should probably leave

[Chorus]
'Cause I know you and you know me
And we both know where this is gonna lead
You want me to say that I want you to stay
So you should probably leave
Yeah, you should probably leave

[Verse 2]
There's still time for you to finish your wine
Then you should probably leave
And it's hard to resist, alright, just one kiss
Then you should probably leave

'Cause I know you and you know me
And we both know where this is gonna lead
You want me to say that I want you to stay
So you should probably leave
Yeah, you should probably leave

[Bridge]
Like a devil on my shoulder, you keep whisperin' in my ear
And it's gettin' kinda hard for me to do the right thing here
I wanna do the right thing, baby

[Verse 3]
Sun on your skin, 6AM
And I been watchin' you sleep
And honey, I'm so afraid you're gonna wake up and say
That you should probably leave

[Chorus]
'Cause I know you and you know me
And we both know where this is gonna lead
I want you to stay but you'll probably say
That you should probably leave
Yeah, you should probably leave
Oh, you should probably leave"
Chris Stapleton,Broken Halos,"[Refrain]
Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine

[Verse 1]
Angels come down from the heavens
Just to help us on our way
Come to teach us, then they leave us
And they find some other soul to save

[Refrain]
Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine

[Verse 2]
Don't go looking for the reasons
Don't go asking Jesus why
We're not meant to know the answers
They belong to the by and by
They belong to the by and by

[Refrain]
Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine"
Chris Stapleton,Think I’m In Love With You,"[Verse 1]
Baby, do you ever wonder
Whatever happened way back when
Or if I'll see you again
And maybe if you ever wonder
Aw, you might wish things could change
I know this might sound strange but

[Chorus]
I think I'm in love with you
I didn't know it at the time
I know what I wanna do
It's makin' me lose my mind
I thought about thinkin' it through
And every time I do I find
I wanna make your dreams come true
I think I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you

[Verse 2]
Ooh, you are the power over me

Chris Stapleton,White Horse,"[Verse 1]
This love is getting kinda dangerous
Feels like it's a loaded gun
My mind, it's turning like a cloud of dust
My heart always wants to run

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
If you want a cowboy on a white horse
Ridin' off into the sunset
If that's the kinda love you wanna wait for
Hold on tight, girl, I ain't there yet
No, I ain't there yet
No, I ain't there yet

White horse

Right now's just not the time
Some things a man's just got to do
I wish you could change my mind

Ridin' off into the sunset

White horse"
Chris Stapleton,Parachute,"[Verse 1]
Street lights along the highway
Throwin' shadows in the dark
And the memories keep on turnin'
To the rhythm of a broken heart

[Chorus]
You only need a roof when it's rainin'
You only need a fire when it's cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing that you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down
And fallin' feels like flyin' 'til you hit the ground
Say the word and I'll be there for you
Baby, I will be your parachute
Parachute

[Verse 2]
There's a song that I remember
I never learned to play
And a lifetime of forgotten words
I never got to say

[Chorus]
You only need a roof when it's rainin'
You only need a fire when it’s cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing that you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down
And fallin' feels like flyin' 'til you hit the ground
Say the word and I’ll be there for you
Baby, I will be your parachute
Parachute

[Bridge]
If you think you're goin' down
Just know I will be around

[Chorus]
You only need a roof when it's rainin'
You only need a fire when it's cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing that you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down
And fallin' feels like flyin' 'til you hit the ground
Say the word and I'll be there for you
Baby, I will be your
Baby, I will be your parachute
Parachute"
Chris Stapleton,More of You,"[Verse 1: Chris Stapleton]
When I think of you and the first time we met
And I heard the sound of your sweet gentle voice
My heart took me over and gave me no choice
And right then I knew

[Chorus: Chris Stapleton & Morgane Stapleton]
It makes me want more of you
Again and again
I fall more in love with you
Than I've ever been
From the moment you wake me up
'Til you kiss me goodnight
Everything that you do
It makes me want more of you

[Verse 2: Chris Stapleton with Morgane Stapleton]
When I look at you now that years have gone by
I think of the memories that time can't erase
And all of the smiles that you've brought to my face
Your love's been so true

[Chorus: Chris Stapleton & Morgane Stapleton]
It makes me want more of you
Again and again
I fall more in love with you
Than I've ever been
From the moment you wake me up
'Til you kiss me goodnight
Everything that you do
It makes me want more of you

When I leave this earth you'll be holding my hand
And it gives me comfort to know you'll be there
And I'll thank the Lord for the love that we share
You're heaven to me

[Chorus: Chris Stapleton & Morgane Stapleton]
It makes me want more of you
Again and again
I fall more in love with you

Everything that you do
It makes me want more of you

Everything that you do
It makes me want more of you"
Chris Stapleton,Whiskey and You,"[Verse 1]
There's a bottle on the dresser by your ring
And it's empty so right now I don't feel a thing
And I'll be hurtin' when I wake up on the floor
But I'll be over it by noon
That's the difference between whiskey and you

[Verse 2]
Come tomorrow, I can walk in any store
It ain't a problem, they'll always sell me more
But your forgiveness
Well, that's somethin' I can't buy
There ain't a thing that I can do
That's the difference between whiskey and you

[Chorus]
One's a devil, one keeps drivin' me insane
At times I wonder if they ain't both the same
But one's a liar that helps to hide me from my pain
And one's the long gone bitter truth
That's the difference between whiskey and you

[Verse 3]
I've got a problem but it ain't like what you think
I drink because I'm lonesome and I'm lonesome 'cause I drink
But if I don't break down and bring it on myself
It'll hit out of the blue
That's the difference between whiskey and you

[Chorus]
One's a devil, one keeps drivin' me insane
At times I wonder, oh, if they ain't both the same
One's a liar that helps to hide me from my pain
And one's the long gone bitter truth
That's the difference between whiskey and you

[Outro]
Aww, that's the difference between whiskey and you"
Chris Stapleton,Cold,"[Verse 1]
Girl, the way you broke my heart
It shattered like a rock through a window
I thought we had it so good
Never really saw this comin'

[Chorus]
Oh, why you got to be so cold?
Why you got to go and cut me like a knife
And put our love on ice?
Oh, girl, you know you left this hole
Right here in the middle of my soul
Oh-oh, oh, why you got to be so cold?

[Verse 2]
What am I supposed to say
If anybody asks me about you?
I guess I'll tell 'em I'm without you
How am I supposed to live
When I built my life around you?
Try to put yourself in my shoes

[Chorus]
Oh, why you got to be so cold?
Why you got to go and cut me like a knife
And put our love on ice?
Oh, girl, you know you left this hole
Right hеre in the middle of my soul
Oh-oh, oh, why you got to bе so cold?

I can only feel my love hangin' on
I don't feel like it's over
I'm still on fire
Why you gotta be so...

[Instrumental Break / Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Oh, why you got to be so cold?
Why you got to go and cut me like a knife
And put our love on ice?

Why you got to be so cold?
Why you got to be so cold?
You got to be so cold"
Chris Stapleton,Traveller,"[Verse 1]
I see the sunrise creepin' in
Everything changes like the desert wind
Here she comes and then she's gone again, and

[Chorus]
I'm just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my heart's behind the pocket of my shirt
I'll just keep rollin' 'til I'm in the dirt
'Cause I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller
I couldn't tell you, honey, I don't know
Where I'm goin', but I've got to go
'Cause every turn reveals some other road
And I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller

[Verse 2]
My heartbeat's rhythm is a lonesome sound
Just like the rubber turnin' on the ground
Always lost and nowhere bound

[Chorus]
I'm just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my heart's behind the pocket of my shirt
I'll just keep rollin' 'til I'm in the dirt
'Cause I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller
I couldn't tell you, honey, I don't know
Where I'm goin', but I've got to go
'Cause every turn reveals some other road
And I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller

[Bridge]
When I'm gone
Somebody else will have to feel this wrong
Somebody else will have to sing this song
Somebody else will have to sing along
Sing along

[Chorus]
I'm just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my heart's behind the pocket of my shirt
I'll just keep rollin' 'til I'm in the dirt
'Cause I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller
I couldn't tell you, honey, I don't know
Where I'm goin', but I've got to go
'Cause every turn reveals some other road
And I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller"
Chris Stapleton,Nobody to Blame,"[Verse 1]
She took down the photograph of our wedding day
Ripped it down the middle and threw my half away
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me

[Verse 2]
She broke all my fishing rods, put my guns in hock
Threw my clothes out in the yard
And changed out all the locks
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me

[Chorus]
I know right where I went wrong
I know just what got her gone
Turned my life into this country song
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me

[Verse 3]
She fired up my old hot rod, ran it in the pond
Put sugar in my John Deere
I can't even mow my lawn
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me

[Verse 4]
She built her a bonfire with my old six string
Took all my good whiskey and poured it down the drain
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me

[Chorus]
I know right where I went wrong
I know just what got her gone
Turned my life into this country song
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me
Nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me"
Chris Stapleton,It Takes A Woman,"[Verse 1: Chris Stapleton]
Whenever I'm broken
Honey, you heal me
When I'm in the dark
You are the light
When I get lost
You know right where to find me
When I have my doubts
You make me believe

[Chorus: Chris Stapleton & Morgane Stapleton, Chris Stapleton]
And it takes a woman
It takes a woman
A woman who sees the best part of me
Through all that I am

Chris Stapleton,Millionaire,"[Chorus 1]
They say ""Love is more precious than gold""
Can't be bought and it can't be sold
I got love, enough to spare
That makes me a millionaire

[Verse 1]
I got a woman with eyes that shine
Down deep, as a diamond mine
She's my treasure, so very rare
She made me a millionaire

[Verse 2]
When we ride around, ride around this old town
In my beat-up car, with the windows down
People look at her and they look at me
And say ""That boy is sure livin' in luxury""
Sweet luxury

'Cause love is more precious than gold
It can't be bought no, never could be sold
I got love, enough to share
That makes me a millionaire

When the kisses fall from everywhere
Like riches on a millionaire
When my pockets are empty and the cupboard is bare
I still feel like a millionaire

'Cause love is more precious than gold
It can't be bought, no, and it can't be sold
I got love, enough to spare
That makes me a millionaire"
Chris Stapleton,Joy of My Life,"[Verse 1]
I tiptoed in the room
I know you got to have your rest
She says, ""Come lay beside me
I been waitin' since you left""

[Chorus]
She's sweet to me
Must be the luckiest man alive
Did I tell you, baby
You are the joy of my life?

[Verse 2]
The first time that I saw you
Mmm, you took my breath away
I might not get to Heaven
But I walked with the angels that day

[Chorus]
She takes me by the hand
I am the luckiest man alive
Did I tell you, baby
You are the joy of my life?

[Verse 3]
Some may have their riches
Some may have their worldly things
As long as I have you
I'll treasure each and every day

Just take me by the hand
I am the luckiest man alive
Did I tell you, baby
You are the joy of my life?
Did I tell you, baby
You are the joy of my life?"
Chris Stapleton,Scarecrow in the Garden,"[Verse 1]
Well he came from Northern Ireland
Searching for the free man's ground
And he came to bet his fortune
On a West Virginia plow
He built a house of timber
And raised a redhead son
Then they worked the land together
And prayed the rain would come

[Chorus]
There's a scarecrow in the garden
That looks like Lucifer
And I've been reading Revelations
With my bare feet in the dirt

[Verse 2]
Well the redhead son got older
And took a brown eyed wife
And the fields were green as dollars
Cause the dirt was black as night
I came in late September
The youngest one of three
And my sisters off and married
So the land was left to me

[Chorus]
There's a scarecrow in the garden
That looks like Lucifer
And I've been reading Revelations
With my bare feet in the dirt

[Bridge]
I know every single fencepost
Every rock that goes around
I've been staring at the red oak
Where I know they'll lay me down

[Verse 3]
The fields ain't what they once were
The rains just seem to flood
And I've been thinking about that river
Wondering how it turned to blood

[Outro]
I've been sitting here all morning
I was sitting here all night
There's a bible in my left hand
And a pistol in my right"
Chris Stapleton,Outlaw State of Mind,"[Verse 1]
Cut my teeth on daddy's old LGO
And I lost my mind somewhere in New Mexico
And TW put a snake on my back
I keep a redbone on my side

[Chorus 1]
And there's people all across the land
From East Kentucky down to Alabam'
Whole lot like I am all the time
In an outlaw state of mind

[Verse 2]
I got friends that know how to have a good time
Yeah they roll their own and drink Carolina shine
I've seen the devil in a dark coal mine
I've been higher than a Georgia pine

[Chorus 2]
And there's people all across the land
From West Virginia to The Rio Grande
Whole lot like I am all the time
In an outlaw state of mind

[Chorus 3]
Yeah there's people all across the land
From New York out to old San Fran'
Just don't give a damn all the time
In an outlaw state of mind"
Chris Stapleton,Maggie’s Song,"[Verse 1]
Let me tell you a story
About an old friend of mine
Somebody left her in a shopping cart
In a parking lot for us to find
Just a fuzzy black pup
She was hungry and feeling alone
We put her in the back seat
And told her we were takin' her home

[Chorus]
Run, Maggie run
With the heart of a rebel child
Oh, run, Maggie run
Be just as free as you are wild

[Verse 2]
A few kids later
We moved out on the farm
And she followed those kids around
Yeah, she kept them safe from harm
And she loved to chase squirrels
And playin' out in the snow
She'd take off like a bullet
Man, you should have seen her go

[Chorus]
Run, Maggie run
With the heart of a rebel child
Oh, run, Maggie run
Be just as free as you are wild

[Verse 3]
It was rainin' on a Monday
The day that Maggie died
She woke up and couldn't use her legs
So I laid down by her side
She put her head on my hand
Like she'd done so many times
I told her she was a good dog
Then I told her goodbye

[Chorus]
Run, Maggie run
With the heart of a rebel child
Oh, run, Maggie run
Be just as free as you are wild

[Verse 4]
I had a revelation
As the tractor dug a hole
I can tell you right now
That a dog has a soul
And I thought to myself
As we buried her on the hill
I never knew me a better dog
And I guess I never will

[Chorus]
Run, Maggie run
With the heart of a rebel child
Oh, run, Maggie run
Be just as free as you are wild
Oh, run, Maggie run
With the heart of a rebel child
Oh, run, Maggie run
Be just as free as you are wild"
Chris Stapleton,Daddy Doesn’t Pray Anymore,"[Chorus]
Daddy doesn't pray anymore
I guess he's finished talkin' to the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
But daddy doesn't pray anymore

[Verse 1]
I remember even when the times were bad
He thanked Jesus for everything he had
For a good wife and three children and the food upon our plates
Yeah, everything was right when he said grace

[Chorus]
Daddy doesn't pray anymore
I guess he's finished talkin' to the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
But daddy doesn't pray anymore

[Verse 2]
There was a time when we didn't get along
'Cause I thought I was right and he was wrong
Still when I laid down at night I'd hear him get down on his knees
And say a little prayer for me

[Chorus]
Daddy doesn't pray anymore
I guess he's finished talkin' to the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
But daddy doesn't pray anymore

[Interlude]

[Bridge]
Today I followed daddy down to church
And listened to the preacher read God's word
And we sang his favorite hymn but daddy didn't make a sound
And this afternoon we'll lay him in the ground

[Chorus]
Daddy doesn't pray anymore
I guess he's finally walkin' with the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
But daddy doesn't pray anymore"
Chris Stapleton,When the Stars Come Out,"[Verse 1]
I was lookin' for a change of scene
You were lookin' at a magazine
It was red carpets and limousines
And the grass seemed so much greener
All we wanted was to get there fast
So we packed up everything we had
Runnin' on hope and a tank of gas
Like dreams ain't just for dreamers

[Pre-Chorus]
We couldn't wait to leave that life behind
And try to find salvation in that city limit sign

[Chorus]
And one of those L.A. nights
When the stars come out
Oh, the stars come out
And shine
And they burn so bright
They drown the downtown lights
When the stars come out
Oh, when the stars come out

[Verse 2]
Everybody's somebody, someday
Everybody's got a part to play
Everybody's tryin' to find a way
To say what needs sayin'
Everybody's got a friend of a friend
Somebody that can get you in
Beggin' angels for a sin
In a game that we're all playin'

[Pre-Chorus]
You and I, we're gamblers holdin' cards that we can't see
And I'm bettin' on you, and you're bettin' on me

[Chorus]
One of those L.A. nights
When the stars come out
Oh, the stars come out
And shine
And they burn so bright
They drown the downtown lights
When the stars come out
Oh, when the stars come out

[Bridge]
Down on the freeway, the sun is out of sight
And I got a feelin' tonight might be the night
Yeah, tonight might be the night

[Chorus]
One of those L.A. nights
When the stars come out
Oh, the stars come out
And shine
And they burn so bright
They drown the downtown lights
When the stars come out
Oh, when the stars come out

[Outro]
When the stars come out, ohh
When the stars come out"
Chris Stapleton,What Are You Listening To?,"[Verse 1]
I put that record on
Girl, you know what song
And I let it play again and again
You're in every line
Takes me back in time
Yeah, tonight I'm wondering

[Chorus]
What are you listening to?
Is it a cover band?
In some college town bar
Where it's na, na, na's
And air guitars
Or is it?
Something to get you through
Just a sad song playing on the radio station
Tears still falling
Heart's still breaking
'Cause you're hanging on
Or is it a love song?
About someone new?
What are you listening to?

[Verse 2]
I like to believe
That you're just like me
Trying to figure out how a good thing goes bad
I don't know
I can't let it go
Yeah, it's about to drive me mad

[Chorus]
What are you listening to?
Is it a cover band?
In some college town bar
Where it's na, na, na's
And air guitars
Or is it?
Something to get you through
Just a sad song playing on the radio station
Tears still falling
Heart's still breaking
'Cause you're hanging on
Or is it a love song?
About someone new?
What are you listening to?

[Bridge]
Is it a feel good song
Gets you driving too fast
The one that gets you moving
On past the past
Or the kind that you can't help singing along
Singing woah-oh-oh-ohhh
If it's headphones on
On a downtown train
Or the window seat
On an outbound plane
Is it LA sunny?
Or Memphis blue?
I wish I knew
I wish I knew

[Chorus]
What are you listening to?
Is it a cover band?
In some college town bar
Where it's na, na, na's
And air guitars
Or is it?
Something to get you through
Just a sad song playing on the radio station
Tears still falling
Heart's still breaking
'Cause you're hanging on
Or is it a love song?
About someone new?
What are you listening to?"
Chris Stapleton,A Simple Song,"[Verse 1]
Lately things are on my mind
Good news is hard to find
And I work on the factory line
And all I do is stay behind
Call my mama like I should
She says daddy ain't doing too good
Me and him should wet a line
Just can't seem to find the time

[Chorus]
But I love my life
Man it's something to see
It's the kids and the dogs and you and me
It's the way it's alright when everything goes wrong
It's the sound of a slow simple song

[Verse 2]
Finally saved some money up
'Til I had to fix my truck
Talked to brother the other day
He didn't have too much to say
Tryna quit these cigarettes
I can't seem to kick em yet
Sister got laid off last fall
And I got high cholesterol

[Chorus]
But I love my life
Man it's something to see
It's the kids and the dogs and you and me
It's the way it's alright when everything goes wrong
It's the sound of a slow simple song

But I love my life
Man it's something to see
It's the kids and the dogs and you and me
It's the way it's alright when everything goes wrong
It's the sound of a slow simple song"
Chris Stapleton,I Was Wrong,"[Verse 1]
I've been thinkin' 'bout my thoughtless words
And I know just how much they must have hurt
And I take it back
Oh, won't you let me take it back

[Verse 2]
I know I told you that I don't love you
And I'd be better off with someone new
But I take it back
Won't you let me take it back

[Chorus]
Girl, you know that I still love you
And you know that I'm so alone
I don't know why I told you that I didn't need you
Can't you see that, baby, I was wrong

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
What I wouldn't give to be your lover again
All I want to do is touch your skin, yeah
If I had you right here, right now
I'd tell you, tell you, tell you, tell you

[Chorus]
Girl, you know that I still love you
And you know that I'm so alone
And I don't know why I told you that I didn't need you
Can't you see that, baby, I was wrong"

Alison Krauss,Baby Mine,"[Verse 1]
Baby mine, don't you cry
Baby mine, dry your eyes
Rest your head close to my heart
Never to part, baby of mine

[Verse 2]
Little one, when you play
Don't you mind what they say
Let those eyes sparkle and shine
Never a tear, baby of mine

[Bridge]
If they knew sweet little you
They'd end up loving you, too
All those same people who scold you
What they'd give just for the right to hold you

From your head down to your toes
You're not much, goodness knows
But you're so precious to me
Sweet as can be, baby of mine

Alison Krauss,Losing You,"[Verse 1]
Don't sigh a sigh for me
Don't ever cry for me
This is goodbye from me
I know we're through
I'm losing you

[Verse 2]
Love sang its song for me
Then things went wrong for me
Nights are too long for me
Because I'm losing you

[Verse 3]
Our love and our devotion
Were deep as any ocean
Then one day, like the tide
You began to change
And you became a perfect stranger

[Verse 4]
Someone is holding you
Sharing the lips I knew
I can't believe it's true
That I am losing you

[Outro]
I can't believe it's true
That I am losing… you…"

But darling, I just can't let you

Alison Krauss,When You Say Nothing At All,"[Verse 1]
It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart
Without saying a word, you can light up the dark
Try as I may I could never explain
What I hear when you don't say a thing

[Chorus]
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
The touch of our hands say you'll catch me if ever I fall
You say it best when you say nothing at all

[Verse 2]
All day long I can hear people talking aloud
But when you hold me near, you drown out the crowd
Old Mr. Webster could never define
What's being said between your heart and mine

[Chorus]
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
The touch of our hands say you'll catch me if ever I fall
You say it best when you say nothing at all

Alison Krauss,Lay Down Beside Me,"[Verse 1: John Waite]

And findin' my way wasn't easy to do
But I knew there was you all the while
And it's been worth every mile

So lay down beside me and love me and hide me
And kiss all the hurtin' of this world away
And hold me so close that I feel your heartbeat
And don't ever wander away

Mornings and evenings all were the same
I heard no music 'til I heard your name
I knew when I saw you smile
And now I can rest for a while

Where have you been
My long lost friend?
It's good to see you again
Come and sit for a while
I've missed your smile
Today the past is goodbye
Time can't erase
A lover's embrace

[Chorus]
Can't you hear it calling?
A new day dawning
You were longing to find

[Verse 2]
Love's taken you far
Away from my heart
And I've been here all along
Have your eyes failed to find
What took you from mine?
A vision that's faded through time
But you sail away
Far on a summer's day

[Chorus]
But you heard it calling
A new day dawning
You were longing to find

There is a way
To make you stay
Darling, don't turn away
Don't doubt your heart
And keep us apart
I'm right where you are
Stay

To make you stay
Darling, don't turn away
Don't doubt your heart
And keep us apart

Alison Krauss,"Oh, Atlanta","[Verse 1]

What can I do? I'm falling in love
I'm just an old hound dog
Roaming around door to door
I've got all this and heaven above

Oh, Atlanta, I hear you callin'
I'm coming back to you one fine day
No need to worry
There ain't no hurry 'cause I'm
On my way back to Georgia
On my way back to Georgia

When I remember all those crazy days and crazier nights
Can't you hear the music playing?
You must have heard them saying
""We're gonna rip 'em up and light up the night""

Alison Krauss,Simple Love,"[Verse 1]
Little yellow house sittin' on a hill
That is where he lived
That is where he died
Every Sunday morning
Hear the weeping willows cry

[Verse 2]
Two children born
A beautiful wife
Four walls and livin's all he needed in life
Always giving, never asking back
I wish I had a simple love like that

[Chorus]
I want a simple love like that
Always giving, never askin' back
For when I'm in my final hour lookin' back
I hope I had a simple love like that

My momma was his only little girl
If he'd had the money he'd have given her the world
Sittin' on the front porch together they would sing
Oh how I long to hear that harmony

Always giving never asking back
When I'm in my final hour looking back
I hope I had a simple love like that

Alison Krauss,Ghost in This House,"[Verse 1]
I don't pick up the mail
I don't pick up the phone
I don't answer the door
I'd just soon be alone
I don't keep this place up
I just keep the lights down
I don't live in these rooms
I just rattle around

[Chorus]
I'm just a ghost in this house
I'm just a shadow upon these walls
As quietly as a mouse I haunt these halls
I'm just a whisper of smoke
I'm all that's left of two hearts on fire
That once burned out of control
You took my body and soul
I'm just a ghost in this house

[Verse 2]
I don't care if it rains
I don't care if it's clear
I don't mind staying in
There's another ghost here
He sits down in your chair
And he shines with your light
And he lays down his head
On your pillow at night

[Chorus]
I'm just a ghost in this house
I'm just a shadow upon these walls
I'm living proof of the damage heartbreak does
I'm just a whisper of smoke
I'm all that's left of two hearts on fire
That once burned out of control
You took my body and soul
I'm just a ghost in this house

[Outro]
That once burned out of control
You took my body and soul
I'm just a ghost in this house
Oh, I'm just a ghost in this house"
Alison Krauss,Windy City,"[Verse 1]
We came to big city, from our little country town
And every step he takes with you, is down
And you're as cold and heartless, as your chilling winds that blow
Before you freeze his heart, please let him go

[Chorus]
Windy City; you're haunting my baby
With your bright lights and your avenues so wild
Windy City; turn loose of my baby
If you don't give him back, I'll lose my mind

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
At night I walk your sidewalks, and look in every bar
I love him even though, he's gone too far
Your swinging doors stay open, just to keep him from my side
And I'm on your lonely streets, again tonight

[Chorus]
Windy City; you're haunting my baby
With your bright lights and your avenues so wild
Windy City; turn loose of my baby
And if you don't give him back, I'll lose my mind
If you don't give him back, I'll lose my mind ..."
Alison Krauss,Jacob’s Dream,"[Verse 1]
In the spring of 1856, with the snow still on the ground
Two little boys were lost in the mountains above the town
The father went out hunting; the boys had stayed behind
While mother tended to her chores, they wandered from her side

[Verse 2]
The two had gone to follow him and lost their way instead
By dusk the boys had not been found and fear had turned to dread
Two hundred men had gathered there to comb the mountainside
The fires were built on the highest peak in hopes they'd see the light

[Chorus]
Oh Mommy and Daddy, why can't you hear our cries?
The day is almost over, soon it will be night
We're so cold and hungry and our feet are tired and sore
We promise not to stray again from our cabin door

[Verse 3]
Now Jacob Dibert woke one night from a strange and eerie dream
He saw a path between two hills near a dark and swollen stream
He told his wife he saw the boys huddled close beside a log
For two more nights, the dream returned, this vision sent from God

[Chorus]
Oh Mommy and Daddy, why can't you hear our cries?
The day is almost over, soon it will be night
We're so cold and hungry and our feet are tired and sore
We promise not to stray again from our cabin door

[Verse 4]
A thousand men had searched in vain the west side of Bob's Creek
But Jacob's wife knew of this place and said to travel east
With a guide to take him there, Jacob came upon the scene
And found the boys cold and still, beneath the old birch tree

[Chorus]
Oh Mommy and Daddy, look past the tears you cry
We're both up in heaven now; God is by our side
As you lay us down to rest in the presence of the Lord
Know that we will meet you here at heaven's door

[Chorus]
Oh Mommy and Daddy, look past the tears you cry
We're both up in heaven now; God is by our side
And as you lay us down to rest in the presence of the Lord
Know that we will meet you here at heaven's door"
Alison Krauss,Angel Flying Too Close to the Ground,"[Verse 1]
If you had not have fallen
Then I would not have found you
Angel flying too close to the ground

And I patched up your broken wing
And hung around for a while
Trying to keep your spirits
And your fever down

[Pre-Chorus]
I knew someday that you would fly away
For love's the greatest healer, to be found

[Chorus]
So leave me if you need to
I will still remember
Angel flying too close to the ground

[Verse 2]
Fly on, fly on past, the speed of sound
I'd rather see you up, than to see you down

[Chorus]
So leave me if you need to
I will still remember
Angel flying too close to the ground ..."
Alison Krauss,Forget About It,"Forget about it
I'm admitting I was wrong
And I'll just take what's mine
And walk right out the door

Forget about it
I'll split and I'll be gone
And you'll have memories
You'll find hard to ignore

'Cause after all I'll see you sometime, baby
When I can't recall how you drove me crazier

Forget about it
When forever's over
I won't remember
How much I loved you anymore

Forget about it
Put me out of your head
Now that you're free and easy
Out there on the town

Forget about it
When you're lyin' in bed
Just wishin' I was there
To lay on down

'Cause after all I'll see you sometime, baby
When you will recall how I drove you crazier

Forget about those starlit nights
Layin' by the fireside holdin' you tight
I can't remember when it felt so right
So just forget about it

Forget about it
When you see me on the street
Don't look, don't wave
Don't try to tease me with your smile

Forget about it
If we chance to meet somewhere
Don't think it's 'cause I'm tryin' to reconcile

'Cause after all I'll see you sometime, baby
When I can't recall how you drove me crazier

Forget about those starlit nights
Layin' by the fireside holdin' you tight
I can't remember when it felt so right
So just forget about it"
Alison Krauss,You Will Be My Ain True Love,"[Verse 1]
You'll walk unscathed through musket fire
No ploughman's blade will cut thee down
No cutlass wound will mar thy face
And you will be my ain true love
And you will be my ain true love

[Verse 2]
And as you walk through death's dark veil
The cannons' thunder can't prevail
And those who hunt thee down will fail
And you will be my ain true love
And you will be my ain true love

[Verse 3]
Asleep inside the cannon's mouth
The captain cries, ""Here comes the rout!""
They'll seek to bind me North and South
I've gone to find my ain true love

[Verse 4]
The field is cut and bleeds to red
The cannon balls fly 'round my head
The infirmary man may count me dead
When I've gone to find my ain true love
I've gone to find my ain true love"
Alison Krauss,Till I Can Gain Control Again,"[Verse 1]
Just like the sun over the mountain top
You know I'll always come again
You know I love to spend my morning time
Like sunlight dancing on your skin

[Verse 2]
I've never gone so wrong as to telling lies to you
And what you've seen is what I've been
And there is nothing I could hide from you
You see me better than I can

[Chorus 1]
Out on the road that leads before me now
There are some turns where I will spin
I only hope that you can hold me now
Till I can gain control again

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
Like a lighthouse you must stand alone
Landmark the sailor's journeys end
No matter what seas I've have been sailing on
I'll always roll this way again

[Chorus 2]
Out on the road that lies before me now
There are some turns where I will spin
I only hope that you can hold me now
Till I can gain control again

[Outro]
Till I can gain control again"
Alison Krauss,River in the Rain,"[Verse 1]
River in the rain
Sometimes at night you look like a long white train
Winding your way away somewhere
River I love you don't you care?

But if you're on the run
Winding some place, just tryna find the sun
Whether the sunshine, whether the rain
River I love you just the same

[Verse 2]
But sometimes, in a time of trouble
When you're out of hand and your muddy bubbles
Roll across my floor

Carrying away the things I treasure
Hell there ain't ain't no way to measure
Why I love you more, than I did the day before

[Chorus]
River in the rain
Sometimes at night you look like a long white train
Winding your way away from me
River I've never seen the sea

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
But sometimes in a time of trouble
When you're out of hand and your muddy bubbles
Roll across my floor

Carrying away the things I treasure
Hell there ain't no way to measure
Why I love you more, than I did the day before

[Chorus]
River in the rain
Sometimes at night you look like a long white train
Winding your way away from me
River I've never seen the sea ..."
Alison Krauss,Steel Rails,"Steel rails chasing sunshine round the bend
Winding through trees like a ribbon in the wind
I don't mind not knowing what lies down the track
'Cause I'm looking out ahead to keep my mind from turning back

It's not the first time I found myself alone at dawn
If I really had you once, then I'd have you when I'm gone
Whistle blowing, blowin' lonesome in my mind
Calling me along that never-ending metal line

Steel rails chasing sunshine round the bend
Winding through trees like a ribbon in the wind
I don't mind not knowing what lies down the track
'Cause I'm looking out ahead to keep my mind from turning back

Sun is shining through the open boxcar door
Lying in my mind with the things I've known before
I've lost count of the hours, days, and time
Just the rhythm of the rails keeps the motion in my mind

Steel rails chasing sunshine round the bend
Winding through trees like a ribbon in the wind
I don't mind not knowing what lies down the track
'Cause I'm looking out ahead to keep my mind from turning back
'Cause I'm looking out ahead to keep my mind from turning back"
Alison Krauss,The Scarlet Tide,"[Verse 1]
Well, I recall his parting words
Must I accept his fate?
Or take myself far from this place
I thought I heard a black bell toll
A little bird did sing
Man has no choice when he wants everything

[Chorus]
We'll rise above the scarlet tide
That trickles down through the mountain
And separates the widow from the bride

[Verse 2]
Man goes beyond his own decision
Gets caught up in the mechanism
Of swindlers who act like kings
And brokers who break everything
The dark of night was swiftly fading
Close to the dawn of day
Why would I want him just to lose him again?

[Chorus]
We'll rise above the scarlet tide
That trickles down through the mountain
And separates the widow from the bride
We'll rise above the scarlet tide
That trickles down through the mountain
And separates the widow from the bride"
Alison Krauss,That Kind of Love,"[Verse 1]
Who would sell their soul for love
Or waste one tear on compromise?
Should be easy enough
To know a heartache in disguise
But the heart rules the mind
And the going gets rough
Pride takes the fall
When you find that kind of love

[Verse 2]
I can't help feeling like a fool
Since I lost that place inside
Where my heart knew its way
And my soul was ever wise
Once innocence was lost
There was not faith enough
Still my heart held on
When it found that kind of love

[Bridge]
Though beauty is rare enough
Still we trust
Somehow we'll find it there
With no guarantee
It seems to me
At least it should be fair

[Verse 3]
But if it's only tears and pain
Isn't it still worth the cost?
Like some sweet saving grace
Or a river we must cross
If we don't understand
What this life is made of
We learn the truth
When we find that kind of love

[Outro]
'Cause when innocence is lost
There is not faith enough
We learn the truth
When we find that kind of love"
Alison Krauss,Away Down the River,"Baby dry your eyes
There's no need to cry
Cause I'll see you again
It might be a while
Before you understand

I'm just away down the river
A hundred miles or more
Crossing over Jordan
To the other shore
I'll be standing waiting
With all who've gone before
I'm just away down the river
A hundred miles or more

Now the pictures on the wall
Will help you to recall
They're not there
To make you sad
But to remember
All the good times we had

I'm just away down the river
A hundred miles or more
Crossing over Jordan
To the other shore
I'll be standing waiting
With all who've gone before
I'm just away down the river
A hundred miles or more

When it's time to leave
You're gonna feel the mountain breeze
And the snow will fill the stream
And carry you to me

I'm just away down the river
A hundred miles or more
Crossing over Jordan
To the other shore
I'll be standing waiting
With all who've gone before
I'm just away down the river
A hundred miles or more

[Chorus]"
Alison Krauss,It’s Goodbye and So Long to You,"[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
You can send me pretty flowers
You can send me valentines
Send me letters every day but it won’t pay
Leap to my desires, nothing else will do
It’s goodbye and so long to you!

[Chorus 1]
You can hang around and love me
You can hang your head and cry
Hang my picture on the wall, but I won’t fall
Kiss me when you're dreaming, no good that will do
It’s goodbye and so long to you!

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
You can give me your affection
You can give me all your love
Give me all the things I crave, but I’ll be brave
All the things you offer, make me sad and blue
It’s goodbye and so long to you!

[Chorus 1]
You can hang around and love me
You can hang your head and cry
Hang my picture on the wall, but I won’t fall
Kiss me when you're dreaming, no good that will do
It’s goodbye and so long to you!

[Chorus 2]
You can call me your own darling
You can call me what you may
Call me on the telephone I won’t be home
Keep your old love letters, I’m all through with you
It’s goodbye and so long to you!

[Instrumental]"
Alison Krauss,Dream of Me,"[Verse 1]
My life on the road, its been hard on me and you
Every time we say goodbye, it gets harder to do
But when I'm far away somewhere alone, and the missing you starts
All I got to do is picture you, and I can feel you in my heart

[Chorus]
So dream of me
Every time you get to feeling blue
Dream of me
And I'll be dreaming of you

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
I've been a lot of places, but there's no place like home
And I'm on my way back to you, every minute that I'm gone
So when you get to feeling lonely, just remember we won't always be apart
Close your eyes and think of me, and you can feel me in your heart

[Chorus]
So dream of me
Every time you get to feeling blue
Dream of me
And I'll, be dreaming of you

Dream of me
Every time you get to feeling blue
Dream of me
And I'll, be dreaming of you

[Instrumental]"
Alison Krauss,Maybe,"Yesterday the odds were stacked in favor of my expectations
Flying above the rest, never falling from the nest
Tuesday came and went and now I'm in a little situation
Maybe it's for the best, I can live alone I guess

Maybe I can stand alone
Maybe I'm strong as stone
Even though the bird has flown
Maybe he'll fly on home

Forgive me if I'm keeping you apart from better conversation
I'm numb from all my doubt, trying to sort the whole thing out
Tell me that I'm smart enough to deal with all the information
Spinning inside my head, every word he ever said

Maybe I can stand alone
Maybe I'm strong as stone
Even though the bird has flown
Maybe he'll fly on home

(repeat chorus)"
Alison Krauss,Gentle on My Mind,"[Verse 1]
It's knowing that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch

And it's knowing I'm not shackled
By forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that are dried up on some line

That keeps you in the backroads
By the rivers of my memory
And keeps you ever gentle on my mind

[Verse 2]
It's not clinging to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or something that somebody said
Because they thought we fit, together walking

It's just knowing that the world
Will not be cursing or forgiving
When I walk along some railroad track and find

That you're moving on the backroads
By the rivers of my memory
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind

[Verse 3]
Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman's crying to her mother
'Cause she turned and you were gone

I still might run in silence
Tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me 'til I'm blind

But not to where I cannot see
You walking on the backroads
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind

[Verse 4]
You dip your cup of soup, back from a gurgling
Crackling caldron, in some train yard
Your beard a roughening coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across your face

Through cupped hands 'round the tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find

That you're waiting from the backroads
By the rivers of my memories
Ever smiling, ever gentle on my mind

[Instrumental]"
Buck Owens,Together Again,"[Verse 1]
Together again
My tears have stopped falling
The long, lonely nights
Are now at an end

[Chorus]
The key to my heart
You hold in your hand
And nothing else matters
We're together again

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Together again
The gray skies are gone
You're back in my arms
Now, where you belong

[Chorus]
The love that I knew
Is living again
And nothing else matters
We're together again

[Outro]
And nothing else matters
We're together again"
Buck Owens,My Heart Skips a Beat,"Oh, my heart skips a beat when we walk down the street
I feel a trembling in my knees
And just to know you're mine until the end of time
Makes my heart skip a beat

Well, I did a double take the day I met you
My heart turned a flip as I stood next to you
And I knew right there I never could forget you
For you are my every dream come true

And my heart skips a beat when we walk down the street
I feel a trembling in my knees
And just to know you're mine until the end of time
Makes my heart skip a beat

You came into my life without a warning
And you turned my cloudy skies from gray to blue
You're my sunshine that comes up every morning
Yes you are my every dream come true

And my heart skips a beat when we walk down the street
I feel a trembling in my knees
And just to know you're mine until the end of time
Makes my heart skip a beat"
Buck Owens,Act Naturally,"[Verse 1]
They're gonna put me in the movies
They're gonna make a big star out of me
We'll make the film about a man that's sad and lonely
And all I gotta do is act naturally

Buck Owens,Made In Japan,"My transistor radio comes from far away
And when it's night over here, over there it's-a breaking day
I remember all the good times I had walking in the sand
With a beautiful girl that I met made in Japan
The beauty of her face was beyond my wildest dreams
Like cherry blossoms blooming in the mountains in the early spring
As we walked by the river and she softly took hold of my hand
That's when I fell deep in love with a girl made in Japan

In the dark of night we would lay on Tokyo Bay
And the singing of the birds woke us up at the break of day
Her smiling eyes always seemed to try to understand
All the love in my heart for the girl made in Japan

My transistor radio comes from far away
And when it's night over here over there it's-a breaking day
She cried when she said she'd been promised to another man
That's when I left my heart with the girl made in Japan
Yes my heart will always be with the girl made in Japan"
Buck Owens,I’ve Got a Tiger By the Tail,"[Chorus]
I've got a tiger by the tail, it's plain to see
I won't be much when you get through with me
Well, I'm a-losing weight and a-turning mighty pale
Looks like I've got a tiger by the tail

[Verse 1]
Well, I thought the day I met you, you were meek as a lamb
Just the kind to fit my dreams and plans
Now, the pace we're livin' takes the wind from my sails
And it looks like I've got a tiger by the tail

[Chorus]
I've got a tiger by the tail, it's plain to see
I won't be much when you get through with me
Well, I'm a-losing weight and a-turning mighty pale
Looks like I've got a tiger by the tail

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Well, every night, you drag me where the bright lights are found
There ain't no way to slow you down
I'm as 'bout as helpless as a, a leaf in a gale
And it looks like I've got a tiger by the tail

[Chorus]
I've got a tiger by the tail, it's plain to see
I won't be much when you get through with me
Well, I'm a-losing weight and a-turning mighty pale
Looks like I've got a tiger by the tail"

I can tell by the way you hold me, darlin'
That it won't be long before it's crying time

Now they say that absence makes the heart grow fonder
And that tears are only rain to make love grow
Well, my love for you could never grow no stronger
If I lived to be a hundred years old

That's the way it's happened every time before
And as sure as the sun comes up tomorrow
Crying time will start when you walk out the door

Oh, it's crying time again, you're gonna leave me
I can see that faraway look in your eye
I can tell by the way you hold me, darlin'
That it won't be long before it's crying time"
Buck Owens,Truck Drivin’ Man,"I stopped at a road house in Texas it was a little place called Hamburger Dan's
And I heard that old jukebox a playin' a song about a truck drivin' man
Pour me another cup of coffee for it is the best in the land
I'll put a nickel in the jukebox and play the Truck Drivin' Man

The waitress just brought me some coffee I thanked her but called her again
I said that old song sure does fit me cause I'm a truck drivin' man
Pour me another cup of coffee...

I climbed back aboard my old semi and then like a flash I was gone
I got them old truck wheels a rollin' I'm on my way to San Antone
Pour me another cup of coffee...
And play that Truck Drivin' Man"
Buck Owens,(It’s A) Monster’s Holiday,"Frankenstein was the first in line, And the Wolfman came up next
Dracula wasa doing his stuff- Breathing down my neck
Jump back, make tracks, here comes the Hunchback- Better get out of his way
Fee fee fi fi fo fo fum, It was a Monster's Holiday

Well, I hopped inta bed And covered up my head
Said, ""I'm going to get a good night's sleep""
I got woken up About twelve o'clock And I jumped right to my feet

There was gremlins, and goblins- Dragons, and zombies
Lordy, what an awful sight
I said, ""Good Buddy, you may get me, But brother, let me tell you
It's going to be after the fight.""

Frankenstein was the first in line, And the Wolfman came up next

Uncle Bill, well, he took ill, And they sent for me to come
Well, I had to pass by the old graveyard- So I went on the run
There was screaming and moaning, waving and groaning
Scary as a mummy's curse
I said, ""Good Buddy, you may get me, But brother, let me tell you
You're going to have to catch me first.""

Buck Owens,"Mirror, Mirror On the Wall","Mirror mirror on the wall who's the saddest of them all
But I don't have to see I know it's gotta be me

And the sadness fill the rooms when you're not standin' there
And I wish that I could walk right through the floor
Mirror mirror on the wall...

I'm sitting here wishing dear I had your love again
I'll never even ask you where you've been the key's in the mailbox come on in

Buck Owens,Close Up the Honky Tonks,"She's in some honky tonk tonight, I know
She's dancing where the music's loud and lights are low
In a crowded bar she likes to hang around
And as long as there's a honky tonk she'll never settle down

So close up the honky tonks, lock all the doors
Don't let the one I love go there anymore
Close up the honky tonks, throw away the key
And maybe the one I love will come back to me

If I had the power Id turn back time
And live again the hours when she was all mine
It hurts to see her running with that crowd in town
But as long as there's a honky tonk she'll never settle down

So close up the honky tonks, lock all the doors
Don't let the one I love go there anymore
Close up the honky tonks, throw away the key
And maybe the one I love will come back to me
Yeah, maybe the one I love will come back to me

Close up the honky tonks, lock all the doors
Don't let the one I love go there anymore
Close up the honky tonks, throw away the key
And maybe the one I love will come back to me

Close up the honky tonks, lock all the doors

Children playin' in the lane
Echoes at my window pane

Buck Owens,Excuse Me (I Think I’ve Got a Heartache),"They just don't know how lost I feel without you
My teardrops never see the light of day
I laugh and joke each time they talk about you
But if they heard my heart they'd hear it say

Excuse me, I think I've got a heartache
There's an aching deep inside
And it just won't be denied
Excuse me, I think I've got a heartache
And I better say goodbye before I cry
I guess it's pride that makes me hide my sorrow
I live a lie in all I do and say
My lips may lie and paint a bright tomorrow
But if I told the truth I'd have to say

Excuse me, I think I've got a heartache
There's an aching deep inside
And it just won't be denied
Excuse me, I think I've got a heartache
And I better say goodbye before I cry"
Buck Owens,Santa Looked a Lot Like Daddy (Daddy Looked a Lot Like Him),"[Chorus]
Santa looked a lot like daddy, or daddy looked a lot like him
It's not the way I had him pictured, Santa was a-much too thin
He didn't come down the chimney, so mama must have let him in
Santa looked a lot like daddy, or daddy looked a lot like him

[Verse 1]
Well, they thought I was fast a-sleepin', they thought I was tucked in bed
They never thought I'd come a-peepin' or that I'd hear what was said
Santa put his arm around mama and mama put her arm around him
So if Santa Claus ain't daddy, then I'm a-gonna tell on them

[Chorus]
Well, Santa looked a lot like daddy, or daddy looked a lot like him
It's not the way I had him pictured, Santa was a-much too thin
He didn't come down the chimney, so mama must have let him in
Santa looked a lot like daddy, or daddy looked a lot like him

[Verse 2]
I never saw Dancer or Prancer, I never heard the sleigh bells ring
I never saw the red nosed reindeer like they show on the TV screen
But he sure brought a lot of presents, so Santa Claus, he must have been
Well, he sure looked a lot like daddy and daddy looked a lot like him

[Chorus]
Well, Santa looked a lot like daddy, or daddy looked a lot like him
It's not the way I had him pictured, Santa was a-much too thin
He didn't come down the chimney, so mama must have let him in
Santa looked a lot like daddy, or daddy looked a lot like him"

I couldn't find anywhere else
Hey, I'm not trying to be nobody
I just want a chance to be myself

Yes, I've worn blisters on my heels
Trying to find me something better
Here on the streets of Bakersfield

I spent some time in San Francisco
I spent a night there in the can
They threw this drunk man in my jail cell
I took fifteen dollars from that man

[Verse 4: Buck Owens]
Left him my watch and my old house key
Don't like folks thinking that I'd steal
Then I thanked him as I was leaving
And I headed out for Bakersfield

[Chorus: Buck Owens & Dwight Yoakam, Dwight Yoakam]
Hey, you don't know me but you don't like me
Say you care less how I feel
But how many of you that sit and judge me
Ever walked the streets of Bakersfield?
Hey, you don't know me but you don't like me
Say you care less how I feel
But how many of you that sit and judge me
Ever walked the streets of Bakersfield?
How many of you that sit and judge me
Ever walked the streets of Bakersfield?"
Buck Owens,Above and Beyond,"[Chorus]
Ah well, I'll give you love
That's above and beyond the call of love
And I'll never ever make you cry
Ah yes, I'll give you love
That's above and beyond the call of love
And love's something that money can't buy

[Verse 1]
Well a poor boy's chances for a pretty girl's glances
Are sometimes very few
Though I've got no money, if you'll be my honey
Here's what I'll offer you

[Chorus]
Ah well, I'll give you love
That's above and beyond the call of love
And I'll never ever make you cry
Ah yes, I'll give you love
That's above and beyond the call of love
And love's something that money can't buy

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
We met by chance and I knew at a glance
That I'd found my destiny
Now I want to carry you off and marry you
If you will agree

[Chorus]
And I'll give you love
That's above and beyond the call of love
And I'll never ever make you cry
Yes, I'll give you love
That's above and beyond the call of love
And love's something that money can't buy"
Buck Owens,Foolin’ Around,"I know that you've been foolin' around on me right from the start
So I'll take back my ring and I'll take back my heart
And when you're tired of foolin' around with two or three
Come on home and fool around with me

I wasn't foolin' around the day I said I do
But many a night I wished that I had been a-foolin' too
I know it's foolish taking all this misery
But when it's you, a fool I'll always be

I know that you've been foolin' around on me right from the start
So I'll take back my ring and I'll take back my heart
And when you're tired of foolin' around with two or three
Come on home and fool around with me

So honey fool around, you know right where I'm at
Don't worry if I'm lonesome cause I'm used to that
And when you're tired of foolin' around with two or three
Then come on home and fool around with me

I know that you've been foolin' around on me right from the start
So I'll take back my ring and I'll take back my heart
And when you're tired of foolin' around with two or three
Come on home and fool around with me"
Buck Owens,Under Your Spell Again,"Chorus:
You've got me under your spell, again
Sayin' those things, again
Makin' me believe that you're just mine
You've got me dreamin' those dreams, again
Makin' those things, again
I've gotta take you back just one more time

I swore the last time that you let me down
That I wouldn't see you if you came around
But I can't tell my heart what's right or wrong
And I've been so lonely since you've been gone

Chorus:
You've got me under your spell, again
Sayin' those things, again
Makin' me believe that you're just mine
You've got me dreamin' those dreams, again
Makin' those things, again
I've gotta take you back just one more time

--- Instrumental ---

Well, everybody tells me that I'm a fool
That, I never should have put my faith in you
And way down deep inside I guess I know it's true
But no one else can make me feel the way you do

Chorus:
You've got me under your spell, again
Sayin' those things, again
Makin' me believe that you're just mine
You've got me dreamin' those dreams, again
Makin' those things, again
I've gotta take you back just one more time..."
Vince Gill,Go Rest High on That Mountain,"[Verse 1]
I know your life on earth was troubled
And only you could know the pain
You weren't afraid to face the devil
You were no stranger to the rain

[Chorus]
So go rest high on that mountain
Son, your work on earth is done
Go to heaven a-shoutin'

Go to heaven a-shoutin'
Love for the Father and the Son

Vince Gill,When I Call Your Name,"[Verse 1]
I rushed home from work like I always do
I spent my whole day just thinking of you
When I walked through the front door, my whole life was changed
'Cause nobody answered when I called your name

[Verse 2]
A note on the table that told me goodbye
It said you'd grown weary of living a lie
Oh, your love has ended but mine still remains
But nobody answers when I call your name

[Chorus]
Oh, the lonely sound of my voice callin'
Is drivin' me insane
And just like rain, the tears keep fallin'
But nobody answers when I call your name

[Piano Solo]

[Steel Guitar Solo]

Oh, the lonely sound of my voice callin'
Is drivin' me insane
And just like rain, the tears keep fallin'
But nobody answers when I call your name
Oh, nobody answers when I call your name"
Vince Gill,Whenever You Come Around,"[Verse 1]
The face of an angel, pretty eyes that shine
I lie awake at night wishing you were mine
I'm standing here holding the biggest heartache in town
Whenever you come around

[Chorus]
I get weak in the knees, and I lose my breath
Oh I try to speak but the words won't come
I'm so scared to death
And when you smile that smile
The world turns upside down
Whenever you come around

[Verse 2]
I feel so helpless, I feel just like a kid
What is it about you that makes me keep my feelings hid
I wish I could tell you, but the words can't be found
Whenever you come around

[Chorus]
I get weak in the knees, and I lose my breath
Oh I try to speak but the words won't come
I'm so scared to death
And when you smile that smile
The world turns upside down
Whenever you come around
I get weak in the knees, and I lose my breath
Oh I try to speak but the words won't come
I'm so scared to death
And when you smile that smile
The world turns upside down
Whenever you come around

[Outro]
And when you smile that smile
The  world turns upside down
Whenever you come around
Whenever you come around"
Vince Gill,Look At Us,"Look at us
After all these years together
Look at us
After all that we've been through
Look at us

Still leaning on each other
If you wanna see how true love should be
Then just look at us
Look at you

Still pretty as a picture
Look at me
Still crazy over you
Look at us

Still believing in forever
If you wanna see how true love should be
Then just look at us

In a hundred years from now

I know without a doubt
They'll all look back and wonder how
We made it all work out
Chances are we'll go down in history

When they wanna see
How true love should be
They'll just look at us

Chances are we'll go down in history
When they wanna see
How true love should be
They'll just look at us

When they wanna see
How true love should be
They'll just look at us"
Vince Gill,I Still Believe in You,"[Verse 1]
Everybody wants a little piece of my time
But still I put you at the end of the line
How it breaks my heart to cause you this pain
To see the tears you cry fallin' like rain

[Pre-Chorus]
Give me the chance to prove
And I'll make it up to you

[Chorus]
I still believe in you
With a love that will always be
Standin' so strong and true
Baby, I still believe in you and me

[Verse 2]
Somewhere along the way, I guess I just lost track
Only thinkin' of myself and never lookin' back
For all the times I've hurt you, I apologize
I'm sorry it took so long to finally realize

[Pre-Chorus]
Give me the chance to prove
That nothing's worth losing you

[Chorus]
I still believe in you
With a love that will always be
Standin' so strong and true
Baby, I still believe in you and me

Vince Gill,Don’t Let Our Love Start Slippin’ Away,"[Verse 1: Vince Gill ]
We've been up
All night long
Trying to solve a problem
Hell it's almost dawn
Ain't no time for sleepin'
If our love is wearin' thin
Cause I ain't givin' up
And you ain't givin' in

[Chorus: Vince Gill ]
Don't let our love start slippin'
Love start slippin' away
Cause the life we've been livin'
Gets harder everyday
Don't let our love start slippin'
Love start slippin' away

[Verse 2:Vince Gill ]
A wounded love
Walks a real thin line
And no communication
Will kill it every time
So open up your heart
Baby we can work it out
Cause we've got the kind of love
People dream about

[Chorus- Vince Gill ]
Don't let our love start slippin'
Love start slippin' away
Cause the life we've been livin'
Gets harder everyday
Don't let our love start slippin'
Love start slippin' away

[Outro: -Vince Gill ]
It's past the point of right or wrong
Let's find a way to just hold on

[Chorus- Vince Gill ]
Don't let our love start slippin'
Love start slippin' away
Cause the life we've been livin'
Gets harder everyday
Don't let our love start slippin'
Love start slippin' away

Don't let our love start slippin'
Love start slippin' away"
Vince Gill,One More Last Chance,"She was standing at the front door
When I came home last night
A good book in her left hand
And a rollin' pin in the right
She said you've come home for the last time
With whiskey on your breath
If you don't listen to my preachin' boy
I'm goin' to have to beat you half to death

Give me just a one more last chance
Before you say we're through
I know I drive you crazy baby
It's the best that I can do
We're just some good ol' boys, a makin' noise
I ain't a runnin' 'round on you
Give me just a one more last chance
Before you say we're through

First she hid my glasses
Cause she knows that I can't see
She said you ain't goin' nowhere boy
'Til you spend a little time with me
Then the boys called from the honky tonk
Said there's a party goin' on down here
Well she might've took my car keys
But she forgot about my old John Deere

So give me just a one more last chance
Before you say we're through
I know I drive you crazy baby
It's the best that I can do
We're just some good ol' boys, a makin' noise
I ain't a runnin' 'round on you
Give me just a one more last chance
Before you say we're through"

Vince Gill,I Never Knew Lonely,"[Verse 1]
No other lover ever really cared
When I've reached out for you, you've always been there
Now I'm so far away and, baby, I'm scared
I never knew lonely 'til you

[Verse 2]
You are my rock and the strength I need
To keep me sane in this life that I lead
Now I'm not with you and my broken heart bleeds

Never knew lonely could be so blue
Never knew lonely could tear you in two
Never loved someone like I love you
Girl, I never knew lonely 'til you

You sure have a pretty smile, it sure has been a while
Since I've felt your touch
You've got the sweetest way, I think about you every day
And I miss you so much

Oh, my pretty little Adriana
Are you lonesome tonight?
Oh, my pretty little Adriana
I'll find you when it all feels right

Vince Gill,A Letter to My Mama,"[Verse 1]
Oh, I need to write a letter, put it down in black and white
No, a phone call just won't cut it, not the way I feel tonight
A letter to my mama from the bottom of my heart
""I'm sorry"" is a real good place to start

[Verse 2]
I'm sorry I was selfish, let's chalk it up to youth
I got too old to need you, that's just running from the truth
I'm sorry things didn't work out for you and my old man
Sometimes life don't turn out like you planned

[Verse 3]
Lookin' back, I wonder how you ever pulled us through
I can't imagine walking in your shoes
If I could stop this pen from shaking, I'd write these words down too
There's no one in this world I love like you

[Verse 4]
Oh, I've written down the memories of these sixty-some odd years
Trying hard to just say ""Thank you"" as I wipe away the tears
I hear my grandson calling, so I guess I better go
Could never pay you back the love I owe

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
Oh, I finished up the letter, put it down in black and white
No, a phone call wouldn't cut it, not the way I feel tonight
A letter to my mama from the bottom of my heart
The very bottom of my heart"
Vince Gill,Loving You Makes Me A Better Man,"Loving you makes me a better man
These things I don't know how to do
But you make me think I can

I've got a long way to go
But I know what I know like the back of my hand
Loving you makes me a better man

I've been wrong, more than I cared to say
Time after time I've been lost
Just couldn't find my way

You shed a light on the path through the night
Leading right to the side where I stand
Loving you makes me a better man

I make mistakes, didn't have what it takes
Just to walk out leave it alone
I've got a long lot of heartaches that follow me home

Time goes on and I watch you disappear
I've got a mount to mount
Now that I have you near

You came to me and it's easy to see
There's a line that I've crossed in the sand
Loving you makes me a better man
Loving you makes me a better man"
Vince Gill,Tryin’ To Get Over You,"[Verse 1:]
You could have given me a million reasons why
But it wouldn't change a thing
You said it all when you said goodbye
And you took off your wedding ring

[Chorus:]
I've been tryin' to get over you
I've been spending time alone
I've been tryin' to get over you
But it'll take dyin' to get it done

[Verse 2:]
All my friends keep tryin' to fix me up
They say I need somebody new
When it comes to love, I've all but given up
'Cause life don't mean nothin' without you

[Chorus]"
Vince Gill,Forever Changed,"[Verse 1]
You put your hands where they don't belong
And  now her innocence is dead and gone
She  feels dirty, she feels ashamed
Because of you‚ she's forever changed
Too afraid to tell someone
Well‚  you might as well just used a gun
She  cries for Jesus to ease the pain
Because of you‚ she's forever changed

[Chorus]
Can't  you just leave the child alone?
I can hear the angels in Heaven moan
God was watching and He knows your name
Because of you, she's forever changed

[Verse 2]
Whether  you're a stranger or flesh and blood
There'll come a day you face that Judge
You can beg for mercy, but the truth remains
Because of you‚ she's forever changed

[Chorus]
Can't you just leave the child alone?
I can hear the angels in Heaven moan
God was watching and He knows your name
Because of you, she's forever changed"
Vince Gill,Which Bridge To Cross (Which Bridge To Burn),"[Verse 1:]
I've got two lovers in my life now
A true love and one that's brand new
I'm not really sure that I know how
To love one and tell one we're through

[Chorus:]
I can't sleep at night, I toss and turn
I keep losing sight of lessons I've learned
I'm standing at the crossroads with just one concern
Which bridge to cross and which bridge to burn

I knew this was wrong, I didn't listen
Cause a heart only knows what feels right
Oh I need to reach a decision
And get on with the rest of my life

[Chorus]"
Vince Gill,If You Ever Have Forever In Mind,"[Verse 1:]
You're climbing mountains, I'm on a hill
You're always running I'm standing still
You live for the moment, no future no past
I may be a fool to love by the rules and want it to last

[Chorus:]
If you ever have forever in mind
I'll be here and easy to find
If your heart isn't ready to lay down with mine
If you ever have forever in mind

[Verse 2:]
The music has ended still you want to dance
I know that feeling, I can't take that chance
You live for the moment no future no past
I may be a fool to love by the rules, I want it to last

Vince Gill,My Kind Of Woman / My Kind Of Man,"[Verse 1:]
You don't need diamonds or big fancy cars
You say your happy right where you are
We're bound together by a little gold band
You're my kind of woman
Oh, you're my kind of man
Oh living without you is my only fear
You still drive me crazy when I hold you near
My body trembles with each touch of your hand
You're my kind of woman
Oh, you're my kind of man

[Chorus:][x2]
You're my kind of woman
You're my kind of man
A match made in heaven
By God's gentle hands
I'll love you forever
Together we'll stand
You're my kind of woman
You're my kind of man"
Vince Gill,Pocket Full Of Gold,"[Verse 1]
He slipped the ring off his finger
When he walked in the room
And he found him some stranger
And promised her the moon
How many lies, you must have told
You think you're a rich man
With your pocket full of gold

[Verse 2]
For another man's treasure
You'd say anything
But is one night of pleasure
Worth the trouble you'll bring
Don't look so surprised
'Cause son, I should know
I once was a rich man
With my pocket full of gold

[Verse 3]
Some night you're gonna wind up
On the wrong end of a gun
Some jealous guy's gonna show up
And you'll pay for what you've done
And what will it say on your tombstone
Here lies a rich man
With his pocket full of gold

[Outro]
Yeah, here lies a rich man
With his pocket full of gold"
Vince Gill,Let’s Make Sure We Kiss Goodbye,"[Verse 1:]
Kiss me like you'll never see my face again
As soft and tender as you can
Hold me like we'll never make sweet love again
Please make me feel like a man

[Chorus:]
So let's send up a prayer
For this love that we share
'Cause it could change in the blink of an eye
You just never know
How tomorrow will go
So let's make sure we kiss goodbye
Let's make sure we kiss goodbye

Look at me just like the day we fell in love
And found the missing pieces to our souls
You and me have always fit just like a glove
Wherever you are feels like home

[Chorus]"
Vince Gill,When My Amy Prays,"[Verse 1]
All my life I've known of Jesus
But that connection never came
And when my world was torn to pieces
I still couldn't call His name

[Chorus]
But when my Amy prays
When my Amy prays
That's when I see His face

[Verse 2]
She gave me my first Bible
It sits right beside my bed
And on the nights my hands are rattled
I turn the pages, but it's seldom read

[Chorus]
And when my Amy prays
When my Amy prays
That's when I feel grace

[Verse 3]
She's got my back and she don't judge me
She gives my heart some time to change
Even at my worst, I know she loves me
She's my shelter from the rain

[Chorus]
And when my Amy prays
When my Amy prays
That's when my hands raise
And when my Amy prays
And when my Amy prays
That's when my hands raise"
Vince Gill,Threaten Me With Heaven,"[Verse 1:]
I can see the tears upon your face, no hiding place
And you're afraid that soon I will be gone, but time will still go on
You're searching for the answers you can find, all in good time

[Chorus:]
What's the worst thing that can happen
If they say my time is through
Can they take away the love
Or they years I've shared with you
What's the worst thing that can happen
That's the worst that they can do
Threaten me with Heaven, it's all they can do
Threaten me with Heaven, if they want to
Threaten me with Heaven, I believe that it's true
Threaten me with Heaven, I'll be waiting on you

[Verse 2:]
I hear angels through the window pane, calling my name
Someday when they carve my name in stone, I won't be
I won't be alone
If by chance a miracle appears, I'll dry your tears

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
What's the worst thing that can happen
What's the worst that they can do
Threaten me with Heaven, that's all they can do
Threaten me with Heaven, ooh, I'll be waiting on you
Threaten me with Heaven[x3]"
Vince Gill,A World Without Haggard,"[Verse 1]
I was on the road in Georgia, when I heard Merle had passed away
Hell, I thought he'd live forever, he shaped every note I played
Tonight these old white lines look different than they usually do
He was my greatest inspiration, the reason why I sing the blues
He taught me how to play the guitar and write a country song
He spent time in San Quentin for the things that he'd done wrong
He made me proud to be an Okie, and God knows we paid our dues
He was my greatest inspiration, the reason why I sing the blues

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm lost in a world without Haggard
Oh, who'll tell the truth to you and me?
Oh, I'm lost in a world without Haggard
It's a world I thought I would never see

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
He gave his life to country music, he's the best that's ever been
An honest voice of reason, like we won't see again
If I could hear one last song, it's Merle that I would choose
He was my greatest inspiration, the reason why I sing the blues
He was my greatest inspiration, the reason why I sing the blues"
Vince Gill,I’ll Be Waiting for You,"I'll find a way to ease my mind
Friends to occupy my time
Oh I'll be waiting for you

I look for your face in the candlelight
Listen for you in the still of night
Oh I'll be waiting for you

People will see me out on the town
And tell you I've been running round
Baby you'll always know deep down
The truth
Oh I'll be waiting for you

I'll keep my word baby come what may
It's closer and closer with every day
Oh I'll be waiting for you

People will see me out on the town
And tell you I've been running round
Baby you'll always know deep down
The truth
Oh I'll be waiting for you

People will see me out on the town
And tell you I've been running round
Baby you'll always know deep down
The truth (you know the truth)
Oh I'll be waiting for you
Oh I'll be waiting for you"
Vince Gill,The Price of Regret,"[Verse 1]
Everyone knows the price of regret
Things in life we never forget
Haunted by what we've done wrong
Yearning for the pain to be gone
Some hide in a bottle and some die in vain
Some wave a Bible and some just go insane
Lay down your judgement or lay down your shame
We're all God's children and we all breathe the same

[Chorus]
You're black and I'm white
You're blinded by sight
Close your eyes and tell me the color of my skin
If we let today
Just pass away
Without kindness and forgiveness, there's no light

[Verse 2]
Everyone's broken, oh, everyone's scarred
All the things we needed wind up in the yard
Brothers and sisters, I mean you no harm
Healing's waiting in each other's arms

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
You're black and I'm white
You're blinded by sight
Close your eyes and tell me the color of my skin
If we let today
Just pass away
Without kindness and forgiveness, there's no light

[Outro]
Everyone knows the price of regret
Things in life we never forget"
Carrie Underwood,Before He Cheats,"[Verse 1]
Right now, he's probably slow dancing
With a bleached-blonde tramp
And she's probably getting frisky
Right now, he's probably buying her some fruity little drink
'Cause she can't shoot a whiskey
Right now, he's probably up behind her with a pool-stick
Showing her how to shoot a combo
And he don't know

[Chorus]
I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville Slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats

[Verse 2]
Right now, she's probably up singing some
White-trash version of Shania karaoke
Right now, she's probably saying, ""I'm drunk""
And he's a thinking that he's gonna get lucky
Right now, he's probably dabbing on
Three dollars worth of that bathroom Polo
Oh, and he don't know

[Chorus]
Oh, that I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville Slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats

[Bridge]
I might've saved a little trouble for the next girl
'Cause the next time that he cheats
Oh, you know it won't be on me
No, not on me

[Chorus]
'Cause I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville Slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats

[Outro]
Oh, maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats
Oh, before he cheats
Oh"
Carrie Underwood,Cry Pretty,"[Verse 1]
I'm sorry, but I'm just a girl
Not usually the kind to show my heart to the world
I'm pretty good at keepin' it together
I hold my composure, for worse or for better
So I apologize if you don't like what you see
But sometimes my emotions get the best of me
And falling apart is as human as it gets
You can't hide it, you can't fight what the truth is

[Chorus 1]
You can pretty lie and say it's okay
You can pretty smile and just walk away
Pretty much fake your way through anything
But you can't cry pretty

[Verse 2]
Oh no, you can’t dress it up in lace or rhinestones
It don't matter if you're in a crowd or home all alone
Yeah, it's all the same when you're looking in the mirror
A picture of pain, so let it flow like a river

[Chorus 1]
You can pretty lie and say it's okay
You can pretty smile and just walk away
Pretty much fake your way through anything
But you can't cry pretty

[Chorus 2]
You can't turn off the flood when the dam breaks
When all your mascara is going to waste
When things get ugly, you just gotta face
That you can't cry pretty

[Bridge]
Oh no, you can't
Ooh, yeah

[Chorus 2]
You can't turn off the flood when the dam breaks
When all your mascara is going to waste
When things get ugly, you just gotta face
That you can't cry pretty

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No, you can't cry
No, you can't cry
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, woo
You can't cry
You can't cry pretty, baby
Oh yeah, woo, woo
No, you can't cry pretty, yeah"
Carrie Underwood,Church Bells,"[Verse 1]
Jenny grew up wild, like a blackfoot daisy
Out in the shack with a blue tick hound
Broke as hell, but blessed with beauty
The kind that a rich man can't turn down
She caught the eye of an oil man dancing
One summer night in a dime store dress
She had the looks, he had the mansion
And you can figure out the rest

[Pre-Chorus]
It was all roses, drippin' in diamonds
Sippin' on champagne
She was all uptown, wearing that white gown
Takin' his last name

[Chorus]
She could hear those church bells ringin', ringin'
And up in the loft, that whole choir singin', singin'
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
And just listen to the church bells ringin', ringin'
Yeah, they're ringin'

[Verse 2]
Jenny was hosting Junior League parties
And havin' dinner at the country club
Everyone thought they were Ken and Barbie
But Ken was always gettin' way too drunk
Saturday night, after a few too many
He came home ready to fight
And all his money could never save Jenny
From the devil livin' in his eyes

[Pre-Chorus 2]
It was all bruises, covered in makeup
Dark sunglasses
And that next morning, sitting in the back pew
Praying with the baptist

[Chorus]
She could hear those church bells ringin', ringin'
And up in the loft, that whole choir singin', singin'
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
You just listen to the church bells ringin', ringin'
Yeah, they're ringin'

[Verse 3]
Jenny slipped somethin' in his Tennessee whiskey
No law man was ever gonna find
And how he died is still a mystery
But he hit a woman for the very last time

[Chorus]
She could hear those church bells ringin', ringin'
Standin' there in a black dress singin', singin'
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
And just listen to the church bells ringin', ringin'
Yeah, they're ringin'"

Carrie Underwood,Love Wins,"[Verse 1]
A stray bullet and a mama cries
Her baby won't be comin' home tonight
Sirens screamin' down the avenue
Just another story on the evening news, oh, whoa

[Verse 2]
Politics and prejudice
How the hell'd it ever come to this?
When everybody's gotta pick a side
It don't matter if you're wrong or right, no

[Pre-Chorus]
And so it goes
But I hold onto hope and I won't let go ‘cause

To keep believin' there will come a day

The struggle, this madness, will all fade away, yeah

Come on, get up and cheer!

[Verse 1: Carrie Underwood]
Hey Jack, it's a fact, the show's back in town

The stadium's rockin', time to crank up the sound
The NFL's best have come to play
Coast to coast, just one thing left to say

Carrie Underwood,"Jesus, Take the Wheel","[Verse 1]
She was drivin' last Friday on the way to Cincinnati
On a snow-white Christmas Eve
Goin' home to see her mama and her daddy
With the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was runnin' low
On faith and gasoline
It'd been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was goin' way too fast
Before she knew it
She was spinnin' on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air

[Chorus]
Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel

[Verse 3]
It was still gettin' colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat
Sleepin' like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said, ""I'm sorry for the way
I've been livin' my life
I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight""

[Chorus]
""Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
Oh, Jesus, take the wheel
Oh, I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
From this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel
Oh, take it, take it from me""

[Outro]
Oh, woah, ooh"
Carrie Underwood,Blown Away,"[Verse 1]
Dry lightning cracks across the skies
Those storm clouds gather in her eyes
Her daddy was a mean old mister
Mama was an angel in the ground
The weatherman called for a twister
She prayed blow it down

[Pre-Chorus]
There's not enough rain in Oklahoma
To wash the sins out of that house
There's not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past

[Chorus]
Shatter every window 'til it's all blown away
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
'Til there's nothing left standing, nothing left of yesterday
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away
Blown away (Blown away)

[Verse 2]
She heard those sirens screamin' out
Her daddy laid there, passed out on the couch
She locked herself in the cellar
Listened to the screamin' of the wind
Some people called it taking shelter
She called it sweet revenge

[Chorus]
Shatter every window 'til it’s all blown away
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
'Til there's nothing left standing, nothing left of yesterday
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away
Blown away

[Pre-Chorus]
There’s not enough rain in Oklahoma
To wash the sins out of that house
There’s not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past (Blown away)

Shatter every window 'til it’s all blown away
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
'Til there's nothing left standing, nothing left of yesterday
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away
Blown away

Blown away
Blown away
Blown away

Carrie Underwood,Two Black Cadillacs,"[Verse 1]
Two black Cadillacs driving in a slow parade
Headlights shining bright in the middle of the day
One is for his wife
The other for the woman who loved him at night
Two black Cadillacs meeting for the first time

[Chorus]
And the preacher said he was a good man
And his brother said he was a good friend
But the women in the two black veils didn’t bother to cry
(Bye bye, bye bye)
Yeah, they took turns layin' a rose down
Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground
He's not the only one who had a secret to hide
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye

[Post-Chorus]
Two black Cadillacs
Two black Cadillacs

[Verse 2]
Two months ago, his wife called the number on his phone
Turns out he'd been lyin' to both of them for oh so long
They decided then, he'd never get away with doing this to them
Two black Cadillacs waiting for the right time, the right time

[Chorus]
And the preacher said he was a good man
And his brother said he was a good friend
But the women in the two black veils didn’t bother to cry
(Bye bye, bye bye)
Yeah, they took turns laying a rose down
Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground
He's not the only one who had a secret to hide
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Yeah, yeah
(Two black Cadillacs)

[Bridge]
It was the first and the last time they saw each other face to face
They shared a crimson smile and just walked away
And left the secret at the grave

[Chorus]
And the preacher said he was a good man
And his brother said he was a good friend
But the women in the two black veils, they didn’t bother to cry
(Bye bye, bye bye) Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, they took turns laying a rose down
Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground
He's not the only one who had a secret to hide
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye

Carrie Underwood,The First Noel,"[Verse 1]
The first Noel the angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep

[Chorus]
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

[Verse 2]
They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night

[Chorus]
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

[Verse 3]
Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord
That hath made Heaven and earth of nought
And with His blood mankind hath bought

[Chorus]
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

[Outro]
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King
Born is the King
Born is the King of Israel!"
Carrie Underwood,Smoke Break,"[Verse 1]
She's a small-town, hard-workin' woman
Just tryna make a livin'
Workin' three jobs, feeding four little mouths
In a run-down kitchen
When you're never takin' nothin' and doin' nothin' but givin'
It's hard to be a good wife and a good mom and a good Christian

[Chorus]
She said, ""I don't drink
But sometimes I need a stiff drink
Sippin' from a highball glass
Let the world fade away""
She said, ""I don't smoke
But sometimes I need a long drag
Yeah, I know it might sound bad
But sometimes I need a smoke break""

[Verse 2]
He's a big-city, hard-workin' man just tryna climb the ladder
First generation to go to college instead of drivin' a tractor
Never had nothin' handed to him on a silver platter
It's hard to be a good man, good son
Do somethin' good that matters

[Chorus]
He said, ""I don't drink
But sometimes I wanna pop that top
Take a swig and make the world stop
And watch it fade away""
He said, ""I don't smoke
But sometimes I wanna light it up
Yeah, when things get tough
Sometimes I need a smoke break""
Yeah

[Middle 8]
So here's to you and here's to when the day gets long
Go ahead, I understand if you wanna take a load off

[Chorus]
I don't drink
But sometimes I need a stiff drink
Sipping from a highball glass
Let the world fade away
Yeah, and I don't smoke
But sometimes I need a long drag
Yeah, I know it might sound bad
But sometimes I need a, sometimes I need a

When the day gets long
When the work's all done

Said goodbye, turned around

Faded into the setting sun
Slipped away
But I won't cry, 'cause I know I'll never be lonely

In a place far away where the water meets the sky
The thought of it makes me smile
You are my tomorrow

Carrie Underwood,Dirty Laundry,"[Verse 1]
That lipstick on your collar, well, it ain't my shade of pink
And I can tell by the smell of that perfume, it's like forty dollars too cheap
And there's a little wine stain on the pocket of your white cotton thread
Well, you drink beer and whiskey, boy, and you know I don't drink red

[Pre-Chorus]
Found it over in the corner
Wadded up on the bedroom floor
You shoulda hid it in the closet
You shoulda burned it, you shoulda lost it

[Chorus]
Now I'ma have to hang you out to dry, dry, dry
Clothespin all your secrets to the line, line, line
Leave 'em blowing in the wind, just say goodbye to you
All those midnights sneaking in
""I'm late again, oh, I'm so sorry""
All the Ajax in the world ain't gonna clean your dirty laundry

[Verse 2]
If the neighbors get to asking, I won't cover nothin' up
I'll tell 'em every little detail, how you drug me through the mud
I'm gonna string up your old button-down and slide it on the porch
Just in case you get the nerve to come knockin' on my door

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'ma have to hang you out to dry, dry, dry
Clothespin all your secrets to the line, line, line
Leave 'em blowing in the wind, just say goodbye to you
All those midnights sneaking in

Carrie Underwood,Just a Dream,"[Verse 1]
It was two weeks after the day she turned eighteen
All dressed in white, goin' to the church that night
She had his box of letters in the passenger seat
Sixpence in a shoe, somethin' borrowed, somethin' blue

[Pre-Chorus]
And when the church doors opened up wide
She put her veil down, tryin' to hide the tears
Oh, she just couldn't believe it
She heard the trumpets from the military band
And the flowers fell out of her hands

[Chorus]
Baby, why'd you leave me? Why'd you have to go?
I was countin' on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe
It's like I'm lookin' from a distance, standin' in the background
Everybody's sayin' he's not comin' home now
This can't be happenin' to me
This is just a dream

[Verse 2]
The preacher man said, ""Let us bow our heads and pray
Lord, please lift his soul and heal this hurt""
Then the congregation all stood up and sang
The saddest song that she ever heard
[Pre-Chorus]
And then they handed her a folded-up flag
And she held on to all she had left of him
Oh, and what could have been
And then the guns rang one last shot
And it felt like a bullet in her heart

[Chorus]
Baby, why'd you leave me? Why'd you have to go?
I was countin' on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe
It's like I'm lookin' from a distance, standin' in the background
Everybody's sayin' he's not comin' home now
This can't be happenin' to me
This is just a dream

[Bridge]
Ooh, baby, why'd you leave me? Why'd you have to go?
I was countin' on forever
Now I'll never know
Oh, I'll never know

It's like I'm lookin' from a distance, standin' in the background
Everybody's sayin' he's not comin' home now
This can't be happenin' to me
This is just a dream

Oh, this is just a dream
Just a dream
Yeah, yeah"
Carrie Underwood,Something in the Water,"[Verse 1]
He said, ""I've been where you've been before
Down every hallway's a slamming door""
No way out, no one to come and save me
Wasting a life that the Good Lord gave me

[Verse 2]
Then somebody said what I'm saying to you
Opened my eyes and told me the truth
They said, ""Just a little faith, it'll all get better""
So I followed that preacher man down to the river and now I'm

[Pre-Chorus]
Changed
And now I'm stronger

[Chorus]
There must've been something in the water
Oh, there must've been something in the water

[Verse 3]
And well, I heard what he said and I went on my way
Didn't think about it for a couple of days
Then it hit me like a lightning late one night
I was all out of hope and all out of fight

[Verse 4]
Couldn't fight back the tears, so I fell on my knees
Saying, ""God, if you're there, come and rescue me.""
Felt love pouring down from above
Got washed in the water, washed in the blood and now I'm

[Pre-Chorus]
Changed
And now I'm stronger

[Chorus]
There must be something in the water
Oh, there must be something in the water

[Bridge]
And now I'm singing along to Amazing Grace
Can't nobody wipe this smile off my face
Got joy in my heart, angels on my side
Thank God almighty, I saw the light
Gonna look ahead, no turning back
Live every day, give it all that I have
Trust in someone bigger than me
Ever since the day that I believed I am
Changed
And now I'm stronger

[Chorus]
There must be something in the water (Amazing grace)
Oh, there must be something in the water (How sweet the sound)
Oh, there must be something in the water (That saved a wretch)
Oh, there must be something in the water (Like me)
Oh, yeah

I am changed
Stronger

Carrie Underwood,End Up with You,"[Verse 1]
I don't really care 'bout making any plans
Leave it up in the air, give it up to chance
Seein' where it goes, seein' where it lands
I just wanna go as fast as we can

[Chorus]
And we could end up broke down on some back road
Lovin' in the back seat to the radio
Wouldn't be the worst scenario
'Cause all I wanna do is end up with you
Get home and we're locked out
Middle of the backyard laying down
Last thing that I'd worry 'bout
'Cause all I wanna do is end up with you (Ooh, ooh)
Yeah, all I wanna do is end up with you (Ooh, ooh)

To the end of the world if you wanted to
Yeah, 'cause you can light up the dark side of the moon
Don't leave it up to me, I'll leave it up to you
'Cause I just want one thing when the night is through, yeah

We could end up broke down on some back road
Lovin' in the back seat to the radio

All I wanna do is end up with you (Ooh, ooh)
All I wanna do is end up with you (Ooh, ooh)
All I wanna do is end up with you (Ooh, ooh)

End up with you, end up with you
All I wanna do is end up with you
End up with you, end up with you
End up with you, end up with you
All I wanna do is end up with you
End up with you, end up with you
End up with you, end up with you
All I wanna do is end up with you, you, you, you"
Carrie Underwood,All-American Girl,"[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Since the day they got married
He'd been praying for a little baby boy
Someone he could take fishing
Throw the football and be his pride and joy
He could already see him holding that trophy
Taking his team to state
But when the nurse came in with a little pink blanket
All those big dreams changed

[Chorus]
And now he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet little
Beautiful, wonderful, perfect All-American girl

[Verse 2]
Sixteen short years later
She was falling for the senior football star
Before you knew it, he was dropping passes
Skipping practice just to spend more time with her
The coach said, ""Hey, son, what's your problem?
Tell me, have you lost your mind?""
And Daddy said, ""You'll lose your free ride to college
Boy, you better tell her goodbye""

[Chorus]
But now he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet little
Beautiful, wonderful, perfect All-American

[Bridge]
And when they got married and decided to have one of their own
She said, ""Be honest, tell me what you want""
And he said, ""Honey, you oughta know
Sweet little, beautiful, one just like you
Oh, a beautiful, wonderful, perfect All-American""

[Chorus]
Now he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet little
Beautiful, wonderful, perfect All-American girl

Carrie Underwood,Drinking Alone,"[Intro]
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Verse 1]
Let me make one thing clear, you can buy me a beer
But you ain't taking me home
No pickup lines, I came here tonight
To shed a few tears on my own
But sitting there across the room, I couldn't help but notice you
Seem a little down on your luck too
Yeah, my heart might be breakin', but this seat ain't taken
And you've got me thinkin'

[Chorus]
We should be drinkin' alone, together
Drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems, we ain't gonna solve 'em
But misery loves company
Tonight all I need is a stranger
Lips with a whiskey chaser
And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
Oh, we should be drinkin' alone (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
We should be drinkin' alone, together (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Verse 2]
I don't know what she did to make you hurt like this
But, I know just what to do
It starts with a bottle of good Reposado
And ends with a shooter or two
Tomorrow when the sun comes up, tonight’s the night that never was
Baby, just forget my name
Won't be your one and only, but just 'cause we're lonely
Don't mean that we should

[Chorus]
We should be drinkin' alone
'Cause drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems, we ain't gonna solve 'em
But misery loves company
Tonight all I need is a stranger
Lips with a whiskey chaser
And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
Oh, we should be drinkin' alone
Drinkin' alone, drinkin' alone (Together)
Maybe we shouldn't be drinkin' alone (We should be drinkin' alone)
Drinkin' alone, drinkin' alone
Baby, we shouldn't be drinkin' alone

[Bridge]
I'll pretend that I care
Baby, pull up a chair
We'll stay here 'til they make us go home

[Chorus]
We should be drinkin' alone (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh, we should be drinkin' alone, together
Drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems, we ain't gonna solve 'em
But misery loves company
Tonight all I need is a stranger
Lips with a whiskey chaser
And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
Oh, we should be drinkin' alone (Drinkin' alone, drinkin' alone), together
Maybe we shouldn't be drinkin' alone (We should be drinkin' alone)
Drinkin' alone, drinkin' alone
Baby, we shouldn't be drinking alone (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Outro]
We should be drinkin' alone
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh"
Carrie Underwood,Good Girl,"[Verse 1]
Hey, good girl (Hey, good girl)
With your head in the clouds
I bet you I can tell you what you’re thinking about
You'll see a good boy (You'll see a good boy)
Gonna give you the world
But he’s gonna leave you crying with your heart in the dirt
His lips are dripping honey, but he’ll sting you like a bee
So lock up all your love and go and throw away the key
Hey, good girl (Hey, good girl)
Get out while you can
I know you think you got a good man

[Chorus]
Why, why you gotta be so blind?
Won't you open up your eyes?
Just a matter of time 'til you find

No good for you
You better get to gettin' on your goodbye shoes
And go, go, go
Better listen to me, he’s low, low, low

[Verse 2]
Hey, good girl (Hey, good girl)
You got a heart of gold
You want a white wedding and a hand you can hold
Just like you should, girl (Just like you should, girl)
Like every good girl does
Want a fairytale ending, somebody to love
But he’s really good at lying
Yeah, he’ll leave you in the dust
'Cause when he says forever
Well, it don’t mean much
Hey, good girl (Hey, good girl)
So good for him
Better back away, honey, you don’t know where he’s been

[Chorus]
Why, why you gotta be so blind?
Won't you open up your eyes?
Just a matter of time 'til you find
He's no good, girl
No good for you
You better get to gettin' on your goodbye shoes
And go, go, go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, he’s low
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh, he’s no good, girl
Why can’t you see?
He’ll take your heart and break it
Listen to me, yeah

Why, why you gotta be so blind?
Won’t you open up your eyes?
Just a matter of time 'til you find
He’s no good, he’s no good
Won’t you open up your eyes?
Just a matter of time 'til you find

He’s no good, girl
No good for you
You better get to gettin' on your goodbye shoes"
Carrie Underwood,Heartbeat,"[Intro]
Mm

[Verse 1]
I love it when we're at a party in a downtown crowd, oh
But I can't hear you call me ""Baby"" with the music up loud
Red wine, good times, no, I don't mind bein' with everyone else
And then there's nights like tonight that I, I want you to myself

[Chorus]
And tonight, I wanna drive so far, we'll only find static on the radio, oh
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Sayin' everything without makin' a sound
A cricket choir in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standin' on your shoes in my bare feet
Dancin' to the rhythm of your heartbeat, oh
And we're dancin' to the rhythm of your heartbeat

[Verse 2]
I wanna feel it like a kick drum, beatin' faster in your chest
I wanna feel you holdin' onto me and make me hold my breath
You pull me closer, my head on your shoulder
Baby, we won't need a song
We'll make a fallen star wish, one more slow kiss
What are we waitin' on?

[Chorus]
And tonight, I wanna drive so far, we'll only find static on the radio, oh
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Sayin' everything without makin' a sound
A cricket choir in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standin' on your shoes in my bare feet
Dancin' to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Yeah, we're dancin' to the rhythm of your heartbeat (Heartbeat)

[Post-Chorus]
I wanna feel it like a kick drum, beatin' faster in your chest

[Chorus]
And tonight, I wanna drive so far, we'll only find static on the radio, oh
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Sayin' everything without makin' a sound, with the
River rollin' in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standin' on your shoes in my bare feet
Dancin' to the rhythm of your heartbeat
And we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat, oh"
Carrie Underwood,Cowboy Casanova,"[Intro]
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh)

[Verse 1]
You better take it from me
That boy is like a disease
You're running, you're trying, you're trying to hide
And you're wonderin' why you can't get free
He's like a curse, he's like a drug
You'll get addicted to his love
You wanna get out, but he's holding you down
'Cause you can't live without one more touch

[Chorus]
He's a, a good time cowboy Casanova
Leaning up against the record machine
He looks like a cool drink of water, but he's candy-coated misery
He's the Devil in disguise, a snake with blue eyes
And he only comes out at night
Gives you feelings that you don't wanna fight
You better run for your life

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh)

[Verse 2]
I see that look on your face
You ain't hearin' what I say
So I'll say it again, 'cause I been where you been
And I know how it ends, you can't get away-ay-ay
Don't even look in his eyes
He'll tell you nothing but lies
And you wanna believe, but you won't be deceived
If you listen to me and take my advice

[Chorus]
He's a, a good time cowboy Casanova
Leaning up against the record machine
He looks like a cool drink of water, but he's candy-coated misery
He's the Devil in disguise, a snake with blue eyes
And he only comes out at night
Gives you feelings that you don't wanna fight
You better run for your life

[Bridge]
Run, run away
Don't let him mess with your mind
He'll tell you anything you wanna hear
He'll break your heart, it's just a matter of time
But just remember

[Chorus]
He's a, a good time cowboy Casanova
Leaning up against the record machine
He looks like a cool drink of water, but he's candy-coated misery
He's the Devil in disguise, a snake with blue eyes
And he only comes out at night
Gives you feelings that you don't wanna fight
You better run for your life

Carrie Underwood,The Bullet,"[Verse 1]
Line of limousines leaves one by one
The prayers been prayed, the hymns been sung
Black mascara's already run
But the tears keep flowin'
You can blame it on hate or blame it on guns
But mamas ain't supposed to bury their sons
Left a hole in her heart and it still ain't done
The bullet keeps on goin'

[Chorus]
Through every branch of his family tree
Every birthday that he'll never see
Every chance to live a good life that was stolen
Through the son he'll never get to raise
His daughter on her wedding day
Wishin' it was his hands she was holdin'
'Til every heart that's left to break is broken
The bullet keeps on goin'

[Verse 2]
The grass grows back around the stone
And friends stop checkin' in on the phone
The camera crews have all moved on
But the wound's still open
The bullet keeps on goin'

[Chorus]
Through every branch of his family tree
Every birthday that he'll never see
Every chance to live a good life that was stolen
Through the son he'll never get to raise
His daughter on her wedding day
Wishin' it was his hands she was holdin'
'Til every heart that's left to break is broken
The bullet keeps on goin', yeah
Oh, whoa

Line of limousines leavin' one by one
Prayers been prayed, the hymns been sung
Oh, mamas ain't supposed to bury their sons
The bullet keeps on goin'

Through the son he'll never get to raise
His daughter on her wedding day
Wishin' it was his hands she was holdin'
'Til every heart that's left to break is broken
The bullet keeps on goin'

Carrie Underwood,Remind Me,"[Verse 1: Brad]
We didn't care if people stared
We'd make out in a crowd somewhere
Somebody'd tell us to get a room
It's hard to believe that was me and you
Now we keep saying that we're okay
But I don't want to settle for good not great
I miss the way that it felt back then I want to feel that way again

[Verse 2: Brad, Carrie]
Been so long bet you'd forget
The way I used to kiss your neck
Remind me, remind me
So on fire so in love
Way back when we couldn't get enough
Remind me, remind me

[Verse 3: Carrie, Brad, and Both]
Remember the airport dropping me off
We were kissing goodbye and we couldn't stop
I felt bad because you missed your flight
But that meant we had one more night

[Verse 4: Carrie, Brad]
Do you remember how it used to be
We'd turn out the lights and we didn't just sleep
Remind me, baby, remind me
Oh, so on fire so in love
That look in your eyes that I miss so much
Remind me, baby, remind me

[Verse 5: Brad, Carrie, and Both]
I want to feel that way
Yeah, I want to hold you close
Oh, if you still love me
Don't just assume I know
Baby, remind me, remind me

[Verse 6: : Carrie, Brad]
Do you remember the way it felt?
You mean back when we couldn't control ourselves
Remind me
Yeah, remind me
All those things that you used to do
That made me fall in love with you
Remind me, oh, baby, remind me

[Verse 7: Brad and Both]
Yeah, you'd waked up in my old T-shirt
All those mornings I was late for work
Remind me
Oh, baby, remind me

Oh, baby, remind me, baby, remind me
Yeah, you'd waked up in my old T-shirt
Remind me, yeah, oh

Do you drive somewhere like Myrtle Beach or Padre Island every year?"
Carrie Underwood,Little Toy Guns,"[Verse 1]
In between the coats in the closet
She held on to that heart shaped locket
Staring at a family flawless
But it ain't a pretty picture tonight
Mom and daddy just wouldn't stop it
Fighting at the drop of a faucet
Cuts through the walls catastrophic
She's caught in the crossfire (Crossfire)
Puts her hands over her ears
Starts talking through her tears
She's sayin', and she's prayin'

[Chorus]
I wish words were like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt, no one
Just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Yeah, no smoke, no bullets
No kick from the trigger when you pull it
No pain, no damage done
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
And just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)

[Verse 2]
Wish there was a white flag waving
Or that they were both just faking
And it was just a game they were playing like shoot 'em up cowboys
Leave the plastic pistols in the front yard
Throw away the score card and just turn off all the noise

[Chorus]
I wish words were like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt, no one
Just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Yeah, no smoke, no bullets
No kick from the trigger when you pull it
No pain, no damage done
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
And just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)

[Bridge]
Toy guns
Ohh, I wish they didn't cut like a knife (Like a knife)
I wish they didn't break you inside (Break you inside)
I wish they didn't bang bang make you wanna run, yeah

[Chorus]
Like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt, no one
Just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Yeah, no smoke, no bullets
No shot from the trigger when you pull it
No pain, no damage done
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
And just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)

Emmylou Harris,Didn’t Leave Nobody But The Baby,"Go to sleep, you little baby
(Go to sleep, you little babe)
Go to sleep, you little baby
(Go to sleep, you little babe)
Your mama's gone away and your daddy's gonna stay
Didn't leave nobody but the baby

Go to sleep, you little baby
(Go to sleep, you little babe)
Go to sleep, you little baby
(Go to sleep, you little babe)
Everybody's gone in the cotton and the corn
Didn't leave nobody but the baby
You're a sweet little baby
(You're a sweet little babe)
You're a sweet little baby
(You're a sweet little babe)
Honey in the rock and the sugar don't stop
Gonna bring a bottle to the baby

Don't you weep, pretty baby
(Don't you weep, pretty babe)
Don't you weep, pretty baby
(Don't you weep, pretty babe)
She's long gone with her red shoes on
Gonna need another lovin' baby

Go to sleep, little baby

You and me and the devil makes three
Don't need no other lovin' baby

Come and lay your bones on the alabaster stones
And be my ever-lovin' baby"
Emmylou Harris,Red Dirt Girl,"[Verse 1]
Me and my best friend Lillian
And her blue tick hound dog Gideon
Sittin' on the front porch coolin' in the shade
Singin' every song the radio played
Waiting for the Alabama sun to go down
Two red dirt girls in a red dirt town
Me and Lillian
Just across the line
And a little southeast of Meridian

[Verse 2]
She loved her brother, I remember back when
He was fixin' up a '49 Indian
He told her, little sister, going to ride the wind
Up around the moon and back again
He never got farther than Vietnam
I was standing there with her
When the telegram come for Lillian
Now he's lying somewhere
About a million miles from Meridian

[Chorus]
She said, ""There's not much hope for a red dirt girl
Somewhere out there is a great big world
That's where I'm bound
And the stars might fall on Alabama
But one of these days I'm going to swing my hammer down
Away from this red dirt town
I'm going to make a joyful sound""

[Verse 3]
She grew up tall and she grew up thin
Buried that old dog Gideon
By a crepe myrtle bush at the back of the yard
Her daddy turned mean and her mama leaned hard
Got in trouble with a boy from town
Figured that she might as well settle down
So she dug right in across a red dirt line
Just a little south east of Meridian

[Chorus]
Yes, she tried hard to love him
But it never did take
Just another way for the heart to break
So she learned to bend
One thing they don't tell you about the blues
When you got 'em you keep on falling cause there ain't no bottom
And there ain't no end, least not for Lillian

[Verse 4]
Nobody knows when she started her skid
She was only 27 and she had five kids
Could've been the whiskey, could've been the pills
Could've been the dream she was trying to kill
But there won't be a mention in the news of the world
About the life and the death of a red dirt girl
Named Lillian
Who never got any farther
Across the line than Meridian

[Outro]
Now the stars still fall on Alabama
Tonight she finally laid
That hammer down without a sound
In the red dirt ground"
Emmylou Harris,Boulder to Birmingham,"[Verse 1]
I don't want to hear a love song
I got on this airplane just to fly
And I know there's life below me
But all that it can show me is the prairie and the sky

[Verse 2]
And I don't want to hear a sad story
Full of heartbreak and desire
The last time I felt like this
I was in the wilderness and the canyon was on fire

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I stood on the mountain
In the night and I watched it burn
I watched it burn, I watched it burn

[Chorus]
I would rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham
I would hold my life in his saving grace
I would walk all the way from Boulder to Birmingham
If I thought I could see, I could see your face

[Verse 3]
Well, you really got me this time
And the hardest part is knowing I'll survive
I have come to listen for the sound
Of the trucks as they move down out on ninety five

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And pretend that it's the ocean
Coming down to wash me clean, to wash me clean
Baby, do you know what I mean

[Chorus]
I would rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham
I would hold my life in his saving grace
I would walk all the way from Boulder to Birmingham
If I thought I could see, I could see your face
If I thought I could see, I could see your face"
Emmylou Harris,Two More Bottles Of Wine,"[Verse 1]
We came out west together with a common desire
The fever we had might have set the West Coast on fire
Two months later got trouble in mind
Oh my baby moved out and left me behind
But it's all right 'cause it's midnight
And I got two more bottles of wine

[Verse 2]
The way he left sure turned my head around
Seemed like overnight it just up and put me down
Well I ain't going to let it bother me today
I've been working and I'm too tired anyway
But it's all right 'cause it's midnight
And I got two more bottles of wine

[Verse 3]
Well I'm sixteen hundred miles from the people I know
I've been doing all I can but opportunity sure come slow
Well I'd be in the sun all day
But I'm sweeping out a warehouse in West LA
But it's all right 'cause it's midnight
And I got two more bottles of wine

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I'm sixteen hundred miles from the people I know
I've been doing all I can but opportunity sure come slow
Well I'd be in the sun all day
But I'm sweeping out a warehouse in West LA

Yes, it's all right 'cause it's midnight
And I got two more bottles of wine
Yes, it's all right 'cause it's midnight
And I got two more bottles of wine"
Emmylou Harris,Green Pastures,"[Verse 1]
Troubles and trials often betray those
On in the weary body to stray
But we shall walk beside the still waters
With the Good Shepherd leading the way

[Verse 2]
Those who have strayed were sought by the Master
He who once gave His life for the sheep
Out on the mountain, still He is searching
Bringing them in forever to keep

[Chorus]
Going up home to live in green pastures
Where we shall live and die nevermore
Even the Lord will be in that number
When we shall reach that heavenly shore

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
We will not heed the voice of the stranger
For he would lead us on to despair
Following on with Jesus our savior
We shall all reach that country so fair

[Chorus]
Going up home to live in green pastures
Where we shall live and die nevermore
Even the Lord will be in that number
When we shall reach that heavenly shore"
Emmylou Harris,Tulsa Queen,"[Verse 1]
I heard the train in the Tulsa night
Calling out my name, looking for a fight
Well she's come a long, long way
Got a longer way to go
So tell me how a train from Tulsa
Has got a right to know

[Verse 2]
Well she sings a song so sad and high
And the Tulsa Queen don't ever lie
And she don't care where she goes
Don't care where she's been
And the Tulsa Queen ain't crying
Because I won't see you again
Hey hey hey

[Verse 3]
And I want to ride like a Tulsa Queen
Calling out to you like she calls to me
As far away from Tulsa as these ten wheels can be

[Verse 4]
Lately I speak your name too loud
Each time it comes up in a crowd
And I know it when I do
The Tulsa Queen and you are gone"
Emmylou Harris,Evangeline,"[Verse 1]
She stands on the banks of the mighty Mississippi
Alone in the pale moonlight
Waiting for a man, a riverboat gambler
Said that he'd return tonight
They used to waltz on the banks of the mighty Mississippi
Loving the whole night through
He was a riverboat gambler off to make a killing
And bring it on back to you

[Chorus]
Evangeline, Evangeline
Curses the soul of the Mississippi Queen
That pulled her man away

[Guitar and Fiddle Solos]

[Verse 2]
Bayou Sam from South Louisiana
Had gambling in his veins
Evangeline from the maritime
Was slowly going insane
High on the top of Hickory Hill
She stands in the lightning and thunder
Down on the river, the boat was a-sinking
She watched that Queen go under

[Chorus]
Evangeline, Evangeline
Curses the soul of the Mississippi Queen
That pulled her man away

[Chorus]
Evangeline, Evangeline
Curses the soul of the Mississippi Queen
That pulled her man away"
Emmylou Harris,Ballad Of A Runaway Horse,"Say a prayer for the cowgirl, her horse ran away
She'll walk 'til she finds him, her darling, her stray
But the river's in flood and the roads are awash
And the bridges break up in the panic of loss

And there's nothing to follow, nowhere to go
He's gone like the summer, gone like the snow
And the crickets are breaking her heart with their song
As the day caves in and the night is all wrong

Did she dream? Was it he who went galloping past?
And bent down the fern, broke open the grass
And printed the mud with the well-hammered shoe
That she nailed to his speed in the dreams of her youth
And although he goes grazing a minute away
She tracks him all night, she tracks him all day
And she's blind to his presence except to compare
Her injury here with his punishment there
Then at home on a branch on a high stream
A songbird sings out so suddenly
And the sun is warm and the soft winds ride
On a willow tree by the riverside
Ah the world is sweet and the world is wide
And he's there where the light and the darkness divide
And the steam's coming off him, he's huge and he's shy
And he steps on the moon when he paws at the sky

And he comes to her hand, but he's not really tame
He longs to be lost, she longs for the same
And he'll bolt and he'll plunge through the first open pass
To roll and to feed in the sweet mountain grass
Or he'll make a break for the high plateau
Where there's nothing above and nothing below
It's time for their burden, the whip and the spur
Will she ride with him or will he ride with her?
So she binds herself to her galloping steed
And he binds himself to the woman in need
And there is no space, just left and right
And there is no time, but there is day and night
Then she leans on his neck and whispers low
Whither thou goest, I will go
And they turn as one and they head for the plain
No need for the whip, oh no need for the rein
Now the clasp of this union who fastens it tight
Who snaps it asunder the very next night
Some say it's him, some say it's her
Some say love's like smoke beyond all repair
So my darling, my darling, just let it go by
That old silhouette on the great western sky
And I'll pick out a tune and they'll move right along
And they're gone like smoke and they're gone like this song

Say a prayer for the cowgirl"
Emmylou Harris,Beautiful Star of Bethlehem,"[Verse 1]
Oh beautiful star of Bethlehem
Shining afar through shadows dim
Giving the light for those who long have gone
Guiding the wise men on their way
Unto the place where Jesus lay
Oh beautiful star of Bethlehem, shine on

[Chorus]
Oh, beautiful star of Bethlehem
Shine upon us until the glory dawns
Give us the light to light the way unto the land of perfect day
Oh, beautiful star of Bethlehem, shine on

[Verse 2]
Oh, beautiful star, the hope of life
Guiding the pilgrims through the night
Over the mountains 'til the break of dawn
Into the light of perfect day
It will give out a lovely ray
Oh, beautiful star of Bethlehem, shine on

[Verse 3]
Oh beautiful star, the hope of rest
For the redeemed, the good and the blessed
Yonder in glory when the crown is won
Jesus is now that star divine
Brighter and brighter He will shine
Beautiful star of Bethlehem, shine on

[Chorus]
Oh, beautiful star of Bethlehem
Shine upon us until the glory dawns
Give us the light to light the way unto the land of perfect day
Oh, beautiful star of Bethlehem, shine on"
Emmylou Harris,Bluebird Wine,"[Verse 1]
Baby brought me in out off the highway
Made me put my money in the bank
Straightened out my crooked way of thinking
Made it purely pleasure when I drank

[Chorus]
And it's all right
I've just hit my stride
Right off the bat
Lord, I'm drunk on Bluebird Wine

[Verse 2]
Now baby taught me a different way of thinking
Like how to spend my evenings here at home
Listening to the music on the radio
Drinking all the Bluebird we can hold

[Chorus]
And it's all right
I've just hit my stride
Right off the bat
Lord, I'm drunk on Bluebird Wine

[Verse 3]
Well baby says he'd really love a party
We'll get some friends together feeling fine
Any friend of mine is worth his habit, yeah
A belly full of baby's Bluebird Wine

[Chorus]
And it's all right
I've just hit my stride
The party just started
Lord, I'm drunk on Bluebird Wine

And it's all right
I've just hit my stride
Right off the bat
Lord, I'm drunk on Bluebird Wine"
Emmylou Harris,All My Tears,"[Verse 1]
When I go, don't cry for me
In my father's arms I'll be
The wounds this world left on my soul
Will all be healed and I'll be whole
Sun and moon will be replaced
With the light of Jesus' face
And I will not be ashamed
For my savior knows my name

[Chorus]
It don't matter where you bury me
I'll be home and I'll be free
It don't matter where I lay
All my tears be washed away

[Verse 2]
Gold and silver blind the eye
Temporary riches lie
Come and eat from heaven's store
Come and drink and thirst no more
So weep not for me, my friend
When my time below does end
For my life belongs to Him
Who will raise the dead again

[Chorus]
It don't matter where you bury me
I'll be home and I'll be free
It don't matter where I lay
All my tears be washed away"
Emmylou Harris,Wrecking Ball,"[Verse 1]
My life's an open book
You read it on the radio
We've got nowhere to hide
We got nowhere to go
But if you still decide
You want to take a ride

[Chorus]
Meet me at the wrecking ball
Wrecking ball
I'll wear something pretty and white
And we'll go dancing tonight
Meet me at the wrecking ball
Wrecking ball
I'll wear something pretty and white
And we'll go dancing tonight

[Verse 2]
I see your smoky eyes
Right across the bar
I've seen that look before
Shining from star to star
Though I can't take that chance
If you got time for one dance

[Chorus]
Meet me at the wrecking ball
Wrecking ball
I'll wear something pretty and white
And we'll go dancing tonight
Meet me at the wrecking ball
Wrecking ball
I'll wear something pretty and white
And we'll go dancing tonight

[Verse 3]
The restless line of cars
Go stretching down the road
But I won't telephone
'Cause you might say hello
What is it makes me feel this way?
What is it makes me want to say

[Chorus]
Meet me at the wrecking ball
Wrecking ball
I'll wear something pretty and white
And we'll go dancing tonight
Meet me at the wrecking ball
Wrecking ball
I'll wear something pretty and white
And we'll go dancing tonight"
Emmylou Harris,One Of These Days,"[Verse 1]
I won't have to chop no wood
I can be bad or I can be good
I can be any way that I feel
One of these days
Might be a woman that's dressed in black
Be a hobo by the railroad track
I'll be gone like the wayward wind
One of these days

[Chorus]
One of these days, it will soon
Be all over, cut and dried
And I won't have this urge
To go all bottled up inside
One of these days, I'll look back
And I'll say I left in time
Because somewhere for me
I know there's peace of mind

[Verse 2]
I might someday walk across this land
Carrying the Lord's book in my hand
Going across the country singing loud as I can
One of these days
But I won't have trouble on my back
Cutting like the Devil with a chopping axe
Got to shake it off my back
One of these days

[Chorus]
One of these days, it will soon
Be all over, cut and dried
And I won't have this urge
To go all bottled up inside
One of these days, I'll look back
And I'll say I left in time
Because somewhere for me
I know there's peace of mind

[Outro]
There's going to be peace of mind for me
One of these days"
Emmylou Harris,Where Will I Be,"[Verse 1]
The streets are cracked
And there's glass everywhere
And a baby stares out
With motherless eyes
Under long gone beauty
On fields of war
Trapped in lament
To the poet's core

[Chorus]
Oh where oh where will I be
Oh where oh when that trumpets sounds

[Verse 2]
Met an Indian boy in Ottawa
He laid me down on a bed of straw
Said don't waste your breath
Don't waste your heart
Don't blister your heels
Running in the dark

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Yeah I like the heat
Of your body laying under me
May your wild lip get you where your going
With your inventions your intentions, your laughter
Your forever yearning

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
I walked to the river
And I walked to the rim
I walked through the teeth of the reaper's grin
I walked to you rolled up in wire
To the other side of desire

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
Well the heart opens wide like it's never seen love
And addiction stays on tight like a glove
Oh where oh where will I be"
Emmylou Harris,Love That Will Never Grow Old,"Go to sleep, may your sweet dreams come true
Just lay back in my arms for one more night
I've this crazy old notion that calls me sometimes
Saying this one's the love of our lives

'Cause I know a love that will never grow old
And I know a love that will never grow old

When you wake up the world may have changed
But trust in me, I'll never falter or fail
Just the smile in your eyes, it can light up the night
And your laughter's like wind in my sails

'Cause I know a love that will never grow old
And I know a love that will never grow old

Lean on me, let our hearts beat in time
Feel strength from the hands that have held you so long
Who cares where we go on this rutted old road
In a world that may say that we're wrong

'Cause I know a love that will never grow old
And I know a love that will never grow old"
Emmylou Harris,Heaven Only Knows,"[Verse 1]
Every night it's the same
I feel your heart turn cold as rain
And know that you'll be gone again
I hear the front door close
You say you got to go downtown
I guess there's someone else you've found
So why you're still coming round
Heaven only knows

[Chorus]
Heaven only knows just why loving you should make me cry
Make me feel like I could die, that's the way it goes
Heaven only ever sees how love's made a fool of me
I guess that's how it's meant to be, but heaven only knows

[Verse 2]
I've heard it said that talk is cheap
But still your words they cut so deep
Lay me crying in my sleep
And the pain just grows
I don't know who's right or wrong
But all we had is dead and gone
So why you keep me hanging on
Heaven only knows

[Chorus]
Heaven only knows just why loving you should make me cry
Make me feel like I could die, that's the way it goes
Heaven only ever sees how love's made a fool of me
I guess that's how it's meant to be, but heaven only knows

[Verse 3]
I'm going to turn and walk away
There's nothing left for me to say
It wouldn't change things anyway
Oh, I suppose
The love I gave was always true
I don't know what else to do
And how I'll ever get over you
Heaven only knows

[Chorus]
Heaven only knows just why loving you should make me cry
Make me feel like I could die, that's the way it goes
Heaven only ever sees how love's made a fool of me
I guess that's how it's meant to be, but heaven only knows"
Emmylou Harris,Hello Stranger,"[Verse 1]
Hello stranger, put your loving hand in mine
Hello stranger, put your loving hand in mine
You are a stranger and you're a friend of mine

[Verse 2]
Get up, rounder, let a working girl lay down
Get up, rounder, let a working girl lay down
You are a rounder and you're all out and down

[Verse 3]
Now every time I ride the six and four streetcars
Every time I ride the six and four streetcars
I can see my baby peeping through the bars

[Verse 4]
Well, he bowed his head and he waved both hands at me
He bowed his head and he waved both hands at me
He's prison bound and longing to be free

[Verse 5]
Well, I'll see you when your troubles are like mine
I'll see you when your troubles are like mine
Yes, I'll see you when you haven't got a dime

[Verse 6]
Weeping like a willow and moaning like a dove
Weeping like a willow and moaning like a dove
There's a man up country that I really love

[Verse 1]
Well hello stranger, put your loving hand in mine
Hello stranger, put your loving hand in mine
You are a stranger and you're a friend of mine"
Emmylou Harris,Prayer In Open D,"There's a valley of sorrow in my soul
Where every night I hear the thunder roll
Like the sound of a distant gun
Over all the damage I have done

And the shadows filling up this land
Are the ones I built with my own hand
There is no comfort from the cold
Of this valley of sorrow in my soul

There's a river of darkness in my blood
And through every vein I feel the flood
I can find no bridge for me to cross
No way to bring back what is lost

Into the night, it soon will sweep
Down where all my grievances I keep
But it won't wash away the years
Or one single hard and bitter tear

And the rock of ages I have known
Is a weariness down in the bone
I use to ride it like a rolling stone
Now I just carry it alone

There's a highway rising from my dreams
Deep in the heart, I know it gleams
For I have seen it stretching wide
Clear on across to the other side

Beyond the river and the flood
And the valley where for so long I've stood
With the rock of ages in my bones
Someday I know it will lead me home"
Emmylou Harris,To Daddy,"[Verse 1]
Mama never seemed to miss the finer things of life
If she did, she never did say so to daddy
She never wanted to be more than a mother and a wife
If she did, she never did say so to daddy

[Verse 2]
The only thing that seemed to be important in her life
Was to make our house a home and make us happy
Mama never wanted any more than what she had
If she did, she never did say so to daddy

[Verse 3]
He often left her all alone, but she didn't mind the staying home
If she did, she never did say so to daddy
And she never missed the flowers and the cards he never sent her
If she did, she never did say so to daddy

[Verse 4]
Being took for granted was a thing that she accepted
And she didn't need those things to make her happy
And she didn't seem to notice that he didn't kiss and hold her
If she did, she never did say so to daddy

[Bridge]
One morning we awoke just to find a note
That mama carefully wrote and left to daddy
And as he began to read it, our ears could not believe it
The words that she had written there to daddy

[Verse 5]
She said the kids are older now, they don't need me very much
And I've gone in search of love I need so badly
I have needed you so long, but I just can't keep holding on
She never meant to come back home
If she did, she never did say so to daddy
Goodbye to daddy"
Emmylou Harris,Bang The Drum Slowly,"[Verse 1]
I meant to ask you how to fix that car
I always meant to ask you about the war
And what you saw across a bridge too far
Did it leave a scar?
Or how you navigated wings of fire and steel
Up where heaven had no more secrets to conceal
And still you found the ground beneath your wheels
How did it feel?

[Chorus]
Bang the drum slowly, play the pipe lowly
To dust be returning, from dust we begin
Bang the drum slowly I'll speak of things holy
Above and below me, a world without end

[Verse 2]
I meant to ask you how when everything seemed lost
Your fate was in a game of dice they tossed
There was still that line that you would never cross
At any cost
I meant to ask you how you lived what you believed
With nothing but your heart up your sleeve
And if you ever really were deceived
By the likes of me

[Chorus]
Bang the drum slowly, play the pipe lowly
To dust be returning, from dust we begin
Bang the drum slowly I'll speak of things holy
Above and below me, a world without end

[Verse 3]
Gone now is the day and gone the sun
There is peace tonight all over Arlington
But the song of my life will still be sung
By the light of the moon you hung
I meant to ask you how to plow that field
I meant to bring you water from the well
And be the one beside you when you fell
Could you tell?

[Chorus]
Bang the drum slowly, play the pipe lowly
To dust be returning, from dust we begin
Bang the drum slowly I'll speak of things holy
Above and below me, a world without end"
Emmylou Harris,Goin’ Back To Harlan,"There were no cuckoos, no sycamores
We played about the forest floor
Underneath the silver maples, the balsams, and the sky
We popped the heads off dandelions
Assuming roles from nursery rhymes
Rested on the riverbank and grew up by and by
And grew up by and by

Frail my heart apart
And play me a little ""Shady Grove""
Ring the bells of Rhymney
'Til they ring inside my head forever
Bounce the bow
Rock the gallows
For the hangman's reel
And wake the devil from his dream
I'm going back to Harlan
I'm going back to Harlan
I'm going back to Harlan

And if you were Willie Moore
And I was Barbara Allen
Or Fair Ellen all sad at the cabin door
A-weeping and a-pining for love
A-weeping and a-pining for love

Frail my heart apart
And play me a little ""Shady Grove""
Ring the bells of Rhymney
'Til they ring inside my head forever
Bounce the bow
Rock the gallows
For the hangman's reel
And wake the devil from his dream
I'm going back to Harlan
I'm going back to Harlan
I'm going back to Harlan

I'm going back to Harlan
I'm going back to Harlan
I'm going back to Harlan"
Emmylou Harris,Blackhawk,"Well I work the double shift
In a bookstore on St. Clair
While he pushed the burning ingots
In Dofasco's stinking air
Where the truth bites and stings
I remember just what we were
As the noon bell rings for
Blackhawk and the white winged dove

Hold on to your aching heart
I'll wipe the liquor from your lips
A small town hero never dies
He fades a bit and then he slips
Down into the blast furnace
In the heat of the open hearth
And at the punch clock, he remembers
Blackhawk and the white winged dove

I remember your leather boots
Pointing up into the sky
We fell down to our knees
Over there where the grass grew high
Love hunters in the night
Our faces turned into the wind
Blackhawk, where are you now?
Blackhawk and the white winged dove

We were Blackhawk and the white winged dove
We were Blackhawk and the white winged dove

Do you still have the ring I gave you
On the banks of Lake Black Bear?
Where I felt certain that I knew you
My cool and distant debonair
Now we drink at Liberty Station
Another cup of muscatel
Wrapped in the strong arms of the Union
Raising kids from raising hell

I remember your leather boots
Pointing up into the sky
We fell down to our knees
Over there where the grass grew high
Love hunters in the night
Our faces turned into the wind
Blackhawk, where are you now?
Blackhawk and the white winged dove

We were Blackhawk and the white winged dove
We were Blackhawk and the white winged dove"
Emmylou Harris,You’ve Been On My Mind,"[Verse 1]
I guess it's time for me to say just how it is that I feel today
Today is just like any day 'cause you've been on my mind
It really hasn't been that long, it's funny where the time has flown
Memories just keep holding on and you've been on my mind

[Chorus]
You been on my mind sometimes
I think I must be going blind
I've seen a world, baby, without you
I don't see myself there too

[Verse 2]
Hardly does a day go by when I don't see your clear blue eyes
Many nights, I just wonder why and you've been on my mind

You've been on my mind so long
I've been thinking that something was wrong
I've told myself I should forget
I don't seem to have it yet

You've been on my mind ?
When it's all that's in my head
Guess I know what I must do
I don't think you'll be there too

[Outro]
Guess it's time for me to go
But as it is I'll never know
Just what it is that I long for so
And you've been on my mind
You've been on my mind"
Emmylou Harris,Roses In The Snow,"[Verse 1]
I met my darling in the springtime
When all the flowers were in bloom
And like the flowers, our love blossomed
We married in the month of June

[Chorus]
Our love was like a burning ember
It warmed us as the cold winds blow
We had sunshine in December
And grew our roses in the snow

[Verse 2]
Now God has taken my darling
And left me with a memory
One memory I will always cherish
Are these last words he said to me

[Chorus]
Our love was like a burning ember
It warmed us as the cold winds blow
We had sunshine in December
And grew our roses in the snow

[Verse 3]
My darling's buried on the hillside
Where all the wild spring flowers grow
And when the winter snows start falling
On his grave I'll place a rose

[Chorus]
Our love was like a burning ember
It warmed us as the cold winds blow
We had sunshine in December
And grew our roses in the snow"
Emmylou Harris,Pancho & Lefty,"[Verse 1]
Living on the road, my friend
Was gonna keep you free and clean
Now you wear your skin like iron
Your breath's as hard as kerosene
You weren't your momma's only boy
But her favorite one, it seems
She began to cry when you said goodbye
And sank into your dreams

[Verse 2]
Pancho was a bandit, boys
His horse was fast as polished steel
He wore his gun outside his pants
For all the honest world to feel
Pancho met his match, you know
In the deserts down in Mexico
And nobody heard his dying words
Oh, that's the way it goes

[Chorus]
All the federales say
They could have had him any day
Only let him slip away
Out of kindness, I suppose

[Verse 3]
Lefty, he can't sing the blues
All night long like he used to
The dust that Pancho bit down south
Ended up in Lefty's mouth
The day they laid poor Pancho low
Lefty split for Ohio
Where he got the bread to go
There ain't nobody knows

[Chorus]
All the federales say
Could have had him any day
We only let him slip away
Out of kindness, I suppose

[Verse 4]
The poets tell how Pancho fell
Lefty's living in a cheap hotel
The desert's quiet and Cleveland's cold
And so the story ends, we're told
Pancho needs your prayers, it's true
But save a few for Lefty too
He only did what he had to do
And now he's growing old

[Chorus]
All the federales say
Could have had him any day
We only let him slip away
Out of kindness, I suppose

[Outro]
A few gray federales say
Could have had him any day
We only let him go so long
Out of kindness, I suppose"
Dwight Yoakam,Fast As You,"[Verse 1]
Maybe someday I'll be strong
Maybe it won't be long
I'll be the one who's tough
You'll be the one who's got it rough
It won't be long and
Maybe I'll be real strong

[Verse 2]
Maybe I'll do things right
Maybe I'll start tonight
You'll learn to cry like me
Baby let's just wait and see
Maybe I'll start tonight
And do things right

[Pre-Chorus]
You'll control me
And oh so boldly
Rule me 'til I'm free
'Til the pain that shakes me
Finally makes me
Get up off of my knees
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Maybe I'll be as fast as you
Maybe I'll break hearts too
But I think that you'll slow down
When your turn to hurt comes around
Maybe I'll break hearts
And be as fast as you

Uhhh

[Pre-Chorus]
You'll control me
And oh so boldly
Rule me 'til I'm free
'Til the pain that shakes me
Finally makes me
Get up off of my knees
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Maybe I'll be as fast as you
Maybe I'll break hearts too
But I think that you'll slow down
When your turn to hurt comes around
Maybe I'll break hearts
And be as fast as you
Maybe I'll break hearts
And be as fast as you

Ah, sookie

[Spoken under Guitar Outro]
Maybe someday I'll be strong
Maybe it won't be long
I'll be the one who's strong
You'll be the one gonna cry

You're gonna cry like me
We'll just, uh, wait and see
Maybe I'll be as fast as you
Maybe I'll break hearts too"
Dwight Yoakam,A Thousand Miles From Nowhere,"[Chorus]
I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
Time don't matter to me
'Cause I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
And there's no place I want to be

[Verse 1]
I got heartaches in my pocket
I got echoes in my head
And all that I keep hearing
Are the cruel, cruel things that you said

[Chorus]
I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
Time don't matter to me
'Cause I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
And there's no place I want to be

[Bridge]
Oh, I...
Oh, I...
Oh, I...
Oh, I...
Oh, I...
Oh, I...

[Verse 2]
I've got bruises on my memory
I've got tearstains on my hands
And in the mirror, there's a vision
Of what used to be a man

[Chorus]
I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
Time don't matter to me
'Cause I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
And there's no place I want to be
I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
Time don't matter to me
'Cause I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
And there's no place I want to be

[Outro]
Oh, I...
I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
I'm a thousand miles from nowhere"
Dwight Yoakam,Ain’t That Lonely Yet,"[Verse 1]
You keep calling me on the telephone
You say you're all alone, well that's real sad
And you keep leaving notes stuck on my door
Guess you're hungry for some more, girl that's too bad

[Chorus]
'Cause I ain't that lonely yet
No, I ain't that lonely yet
After what you put me through
Oh, I ain't that lonely yet

[Verse 2]
Once there was this spider in my bed
I got caught up in her web of love and lies
She spun her chains around my heart and soul
Never to let go, oh, but I survived

[Chorus]
'Cause I ain't that lonely yet
No, I ain't that lonely yet
After what you put me through
Oh, I ain't that lonely yet

[Bridge]
Nothin' left you can do to try and bring me 'round
'Cause everything you do just brings me down, whoa

[Chorus]
I ain't that lonely yet
No, I ain't that lonely yet
After what you put me through
Oh, I ain't that lonely yet
'Cause I ain't that lonely yet
No, I ain't that lonely yet
After what you put me through
Oh, I ain't that lonely yet
'Cause I ain't that lonely yet
No, I ain't that lonely yet
After what you put me through
Oh, I ain't that lonely yet
'Cause I ain't that lonely yet
No, I ain't that lonely yet"
Dwight Yoakam,"Guitars, Cadillacs","[Verse 1]
Girl you taught me how to hurt real bad and cry myself to sleep
And showed me how this town can shatter dreams
Another lesson 'bout a naive fool who came to Babylon
And found out that the pie don't taste so sweet

[Chorus]
Now it's guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Lonely, lonely streets that I call home
Yeah, my guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
It's the only thing that keeps me hangin' on

[Verse 2]
Ain't no glamour in this tinseled land of lost and wasted lives
Painful scars are all that's left of me
Oh, but thank you girl for teachin' me brand new ways to be cruel
If I can find my mind now I guess I'll just leave

[Chorus]
And it's guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Lonely, lonely streets that I call home
Yeah, my guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
It's the only thing that keeps me hangin' on

Oh it's guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Lonely, lonely streets that I call home
Yeah, my guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
It's the only thing that keeps me hangin' on
It's the only thing that keeps me hangin' on
It's the only thing that keeps me hangin' on"
Dwight Yoakam,"1,000 Miles","[Verse 1]
Runway 4, flight 209
Teardrop falls, we start to climb
This window seat proved a poor choice
It shows the dream that's been destroyed

[Verse 2]
A little baby starts to cry
Hey, I would too, if not for pride
I owe so much to pride, it's true
It brought an end to me and you

[Chorus]
But if I could, I'd turn around
Set my feet back on the ground
'Cause all this plane ride holds for me
Is a thousand miles of misery

[Verse 3]
I hear the engines, watch the clouds
The whole damn world looks distant now
But I can't seem to put no space
Between my cold heart and your sweet face

[Verse 4]
Across the aisle, they're holding hands
Revealing brand new wedding bands
But our sweet gold, it's gone to rust
Now my life has turned to dust

[Chorus]
But if I could, I'd turn around
Set my feet back on the ground
'Cause all this plane ride holds for me
Is a thousand miles of misery

All this plane ride holds for me
Is a thousand miles of misery"
Dwight Yoakam,I Sang Dixie,"[Chorus]
I sang Dixie, as he died
But people just walked on by, as I cried
The bottle had robbed him of all his rebel pride
So I sang Dixie, as he died

[Verse 1]
He said, ""Way down yonder in the land of cotton
Old times there ain't near as rotten as they are
On this damned old L.A. street""
Then he drew a dying breath
And laid his head against my chest
Please, Lord, take his soul back home to Dixie

[Chorus]
And I sang Dixie, as he died
But people just walked on by, as I cried
The bottle had robbed him of all his rebel pride
So I sang Dixie, as he died

[Guitar & Fiddle Solo]

[Verse 2]
He said, ""Listen to me, son, while you still can
Run back home to that Southern land
Don't you see, what life here has done to me""
Then he closed those old blue eyes
And fell limp, against my side
No more pain, and now he's safe back home in Dixie

[Chorus]
And I sang Dixie, as he died
But people just walked on by, as I cried
The bottle had robbed him of all his rebel pride
So I sang Dixie, as he died

[Outro]
I sang Dixie, as he died"
Dwight Yoakam,Streets of Bakersfield,"I came here looking for something
I couldn't find anywhere else
Hey, I'm not trying to be nobody
I just want a chance to be myself
I've spent a thousand miles a-thumbin'
Yes, I've worn blisters on my heels
Trying to find me something better
Here on the streets of Bakersfield

Hey, you don't know me, but you don't like me
You say you care less how I feel
But how many of you that sit and judge me
Ever walked the streets of Bakersfield?

Spent sometime in San Francisco
I spent a night there in the can
They threw this drunk man in my jail cell
I took fifteen dollars from that man
Left him my watch and my old house key
Don't want folks thinkin' that I'd steal
Then I thanked him as I was leaving
And I headed out for Bakersfield

Hey, you don't know me, but you don't like me
You say you care less how I feel
But how many of you that sit and judge me
Ever walked the streets of Bakersfield?

Hey, you don't know me, but you don't like me
You say you care less how I feel
But how many of you that sit and judge me
Ever walked the streets of Bakersfield?

How many of you that sit and judge me
Ever walked the streets of Bakersfield?"
Dwight Yoakam,Honky Tonk Man,"Well I'm a honky tonk man and I can't seem to stop
I love to give the girls a whirl to the music of an old juke box
But when my money's all gone, I'm on the telephone singing
Hey hey mama can your daddy come home

Well now I'm living wild and dangerously
But I've got plenty of company
When the moon comes up and the sun goes down
Well I can't wait to see the lights of town

'Cause I'm a honky tonk man and I can't seem to stop
I love to give the girls a whirl to the music of an old juke box
But when my money's all gone, I'm on the telephone singing
Hey hey mama can your daddy come home

Well, I'm a honky tonk man and I can't seem to stop
I love to give the girls a whirl to the music of an old juke box
But when my money's all gone, I'm on the telephone singing
Hey hey mama can your daddy come home

Hey now, a pretty little girl and a jug of wine
Well that's what it takes to make a honky tonk time
With the juke box moaning those honky tonk sounds
Well I can't wait to lay my money down

'Cause I'm a honky tonk man and I can't seem to stop
I love to give the girls a whirl to the music of an old juke box
But when my money's all gone, I'm on the telephone singing
Hey hey mama can your daddy come home

I'm a honky tonk man and I can't seem to stop
I love to give the girls a whirl to the music of an old juke box
But when my money's all gone, I'm on the telephone singing
Hey hey mama can your daddy come home"
Dwight Yoakam,Things Change,"She said ""baby things change""
I said ""But I feel the same""
She said ""well let me explain, baby how things can change""
I said ""but that doesn't show, how a love that could grow
Would become so estranged""
She said ""well baby things change""

She said ""Na na na na na na na, now baby dont try
To figure this out or ask questions 'bout why
Forever's a promise no love can survive
And trust with hearts, just don't apply""
She said ""Cause baby things change""

Na na na na na na na, so baby I quit tryin
To figure things out about all your hearts lyin'
Forever's a promise we couldn't survive
Yeah, I may be slow, but I ain't blind

She said ""I still love you so""
I said ""I don't care to know""
She said ""You once cried my name""
I said ""Well baby things change
Let's don't go placin' no blame
Cause you know things can change""

Dwight Yoakam,"Turn It On, Turn It Up, Turn Me Loose","Well I'm back again for another night
Of trying to break free from this sadness that I can't lay to rest
This old honky-tonk sure does feel like home
And the music with the laughter seem to soothe my loneliness

Turn it on, turn it up, turn me loose
From the memory that's driving me lonely, crazy and blue
It helps me forget her, so the louder the better
Hey mister turn it on, turn it up, turn me loose

If a tear should fall, if I should whisper her name
To some stranger I'm holdin' while we're dancin' to an old Buck Owens song
I know she won't mind, she won't even know
She'll be dancing with a memory crying teardrops of her own

Turn it on, turn it up, turn me loose
From the memory that's driving me lonely, crazy and blue
It helps me forget her so the louder the better
Hey mister turn it on, turn it up, turn me loose

Turn it on, turn it up, turn me loose
From the memory that's driving me lonely, crazy and blue
It helps me forget her so the louder the better
Hey mister turn it on, turn it up, turn me loose
Yeah, mister turn it on, turn it up, turn me loose"
Dwight Yoakam,You’re the One,"[Chorus]
You're the one
You're the one
That made me cry
You're the one
That laughed at me
Then said goodbye
You're the one
You're the one
That made me blue
So how's it feel
Now that you're the one
It's happened to

[Verse 1]
Now you're back calling me with open arms
What happened to the one you met with all that charm
You say he's gone
And you're alone
Well that's a shame
But if you think real hard
I know you'll see
Just who's to blame

[Chorus]
You're the one
You're the one
That made me cry
You're the one
That laughed at me
Then said goodbye
You're the one
You're the one
That made me blue
So how's it feel
Now that you're the one
It's happened to

[Verse 2]
You're begging me to think about the love we shared
Yet it seems to me not too long ago you didn't care
The love you left
No longer lives
Within my heart
The game you played
So recklessly
Tore it all apart

[Chorus]
You're the one
You're the one
That made me cry
You're the one
That laughed at me
Then said goodbye
You're the one
You're the one
That made me blue
So how's it feel
Now that you're the one
It's happened to

[Tag]
Oh tell me how's it feel now that you're the one
How's it feel to be the one
How's it feel now that you're the one it's happenin' to"
Dwight Yoakam,Pretty Horses,"Pretty horses are what I have to ride
Lonely memories are where I go to hide
Empty pages are all I choose to write
But I love, I love
But I love, I love, I love

Broken windows are what I look through
Softly searching for small signs of me and you
Gently thinking of what's left that we could do
About our love, our love
About our love, our love, about our love

About our love, our love
About our love, our love, about our love

Pretty horses are still hard to ride
With each other we will find a place to hide
All the pages are still there to write
I love our love, But our love, our love"
Dwight Yoakam,Little Sister,"[Chorus]
Little sister, don't you, little sister, don't you
Little sister, don't you kiss me once or twice
Tell me that's it nice and then you run
Yeah, little sister, don't you do what your big sister done

[Verse 1]
You know, I dated your big sister
Oh, I took her to the show
Hey, I went for some candy, along came Jim Dandy
And they slipped right out the door

[Chorus]
Little sister, don't you, little sister, don't you
Little sister, don't you kiss me once or twice
Tell me that's it nice and then you run
Yeah, little sister, don't you do what your big sister done

[Verse 2]
I used to pull down on your pigtails
Hey girl, pinch your turned-up nose
Oh, but baby you've been growin' and lately it's been showin'
From your head down to your toes

[Chorus]
Little sister, don't you, little sister, don't you
Little sister, don't you kiss me once or twice
Tell me that's it nice and then you run
Yeah, little sister, don't you do what your big sister done

[Verse 3]
Every time I see your sister
Lord, she's with somebody new
Oh, she's mean and she's evil like a little old boll weevil
Think I'll try my love with you

[Chorus]
Little sister, don't you, little sister, don't you
Little sister, don't you kiss me once or twice
Tell me that's it nice and then you run
Yeah, little sister, don't you do what your big sister done

Oh, little sister, don't you do what your big sister done"
Dwight Yoakam,Long White Cadillac,"Night wolves moan
Winter hills are black
I'm all alone
Sitting in the back
Of a long white Cadillac

Train whistle cries
Lost on its own track
I close my eyes
Sitting in the back
Of a long white Cadillac

Sometimes I blame it on a woman
The one that made my poor heart bleed
Sometimes I blame it on the money
Sometimes I blame it all on me

Headlights shine
Highway fades to black
It's my last ride
Sitting in the back
Of a long white Cadillac

Sometimes I blame it on a woman
The one that made my poor heart bleed
Sometimes I blame it on the money
Sometimes I blame it all on me

Train whistle cries
Lost on its own track
I close my eyes
I ain't never coming back
In a long white Cadillac

In a long white Cadillac
In a long white Cadillac
In a long white Cadillac
In a long white Cadillac

Ah, bye bye baby...

Dwight Yoakam,Baby Don’t Go,"She never had a mother
She hardly knew her dad
She's been in town for 18 years
And I'm the only boy she's had

Chorus:
Oh baby don't go
Pretty baby please don't go
I love you so
Pretty baby don't go

I never had no money
I bought at the second hand store
The way this old town laughs at me
I just can't take it no more

Said she can't stay
She's gonna be a lady someday

Chorus:
Oh baby don't go
Pretty baby please don't go
I love you so
Pretty baby don't go

When she gets to the city
Her tears will all be dry
My eyes will look so pretty
No one's gonna know I cried
She's goin' away
Hey maybe she'll come back someday

Chorus:
Oh baby don't go
Pretty baby please don't go
I love you so
Pretty baby don't go

Oh baby don't go

Dwight Yoakam,Suspicious Minds,"We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, Baby
Why can't you see
What you're doing to me
When you don't believe a word I'm saying?

We can't go on together
With suspicious minds
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds

So, if an old friend I know
Drops by to say hello
Would I still see suspicion in your eyes?
Here we go again
Asking where I've been
Can't you see these tears are real
I'm crying

We can't go on together
With suspicious minds
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds...

Oh, let our love survive
I'll dry the tears from your eyes
Let's don't let a good thing die
Honey, you know
I've never lied to you
No-o, Never lied to you

We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, Baby
Why can't you see
What you're doing to me
When you don't believe a word I'm saying?

We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, Baby

We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, Baby

We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, Baby..."
Dwight Yoakam,Buenas Noches From a Lonely Room (She Wore Red Dresses),"[Verse 1]
She wore red dresses with her black shining hair
She had my baby and caused me to care
Then coldly she left me to suffer and cry
Oh, she wore red dresses and told such sweet lies

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
I never knew him but he took her away
And on my knees like a madman for vengeance I prayed
While the pain and the anger destroyed my weak mind
Oh, she wore red dresses and left the wounded behind

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I searched till I found them, then I cursed at the sight
Of their sleeping shadows in the cold neon light
In the dark morning silence, I placed the gun to her head
Oh, she wore red dresses but now she lay dead

[Instrumental]"
Dwight Yoakam,Purple Rain (Bluegrass Version),"[Verse 1:]
I never meant to cause you any sorrow
I never meant to cause you any pain
I only wanted to one time to see you laughing
I only wanted to see you
Laughing in the purple rain

[Chorus:]
Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
I only wanted to see you
Bathing in the purple rain

[Verse 2:]
I never wanted to be your weekend lover
I only wanted to be some kind of friend
Baby, I could never steal you from another
It's such a shame our friendship had to end

[Chorus:]
Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
I only wanted to see you
Bathing in the purple rain

[Verse 3:]
Honey, I know, I know
I know times are changing
It's time we all reach out
For something new, that means you too
You say you want a leader
But you can't seem to make up your mind
I think you better close it
And let me guide you to the purple rain

[Chorus:]
Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
I only wanted to see you
Bathing in the purple rain"
Dwight Yoakam,"Readin’, Rightin’, Rt. 23","[Chorus 1]
They learned readin', writin', Route 23
To the jobs that laid a-waiting in those cities' factories
They didn't know that old highway
Could lead them to a world of misery

[Verse 1]
Have you ever been down Kentucky way
Say south of Prestonsburg?
Have you ever been up in a holler
And have you ever heard
A mountain man cough his life away
From diggin' that black coal
In those dark mines, those dark mines?
If you had, you might just understand
The reason that they left it all behind

[Chorus 2]
They learned readin', writin', Route 23
To the jobs that laid a-waiting in those cities' factories
They learned readin', writin', roads to the north
To the luxury and comfort a coal miner can't afford
They thought readin', writin', Route 23
Would take them to the good life that they had never seen
They didn't know that old highway
Could lead them to a world of misery

[Verse 2]
Have you ever seen 'em
Put the kids in the car after work on Friday night
Pull up in a holler about 2 AM
And see a light still burnin' bright
Those mountain folks sat up that late
Just to hold those little grandkids
In their arms, in their arms
And I'm proud to say that I've been blessed
And touched by their sweet hillbilly charm

[Chorus 2]
They learned readin', writin', Route 23
To the jobs that laid a-waiting in those cities' factories
They learned readin', writin', roads to the north
To the luxury and comfort a coal miner can't afford
They thought readin', writin', Route 23
Would take them to the good life that they had never seen
They didn't know that old highway
Could lead them to a world of misery

[Outro]
Yeah, it turns out that that old highway
Leads you to a world of misery
They found out that that old highway
Leads you to a world of misery"
Dwight Yoakam,The Back Of Your Hand,"When you give it up for gone
But your still diggin in the mine
And your starin out the window
Sayin everything will be just fine
Keepin with the whole affair
Every word seems outta line
No matter what angle you get
It's polish till it shine

Chorus:
So take a guess, where I stand
Pick a number, one to two
Take a look at the back of your hand
Just like ya know it, ya know me too

When ya say ""Who the hell am I living with
What just went down?
Where did this come from, why are all my colors faded brown?
When did he change? What's with the rage?
Who's the dude with the extra role?
What's the verse, the line, the chapter, the page?""

Chorus

You think your lost without anyplace left to go
Like you need, one of those kisses, long and slow
First glance is not what it seems but theres some things that I just know
Like you take two sugars with a splash of cream

Chorus
Yeah, like ya know it, you know me too
Just like ya know it, ya know me too"
Dwight Yoakam,Two Doors Down,"Two doors down there's a jukebox
That plays all night long
Real sad songs
All about me and you

An' two doors down there's a barmaid
That serves 'em real strong
Here lately
That's how I make it through

An' two doors down there's a heartache
That once was my friend
An' two doors down there's a memory
That won't ever end

Two doors down there's a bar stool
That knows me by name
And we sit there together
And wait for you

Two doors down there's a bottle
Where I take out my shame
And hold it up
For the whole world to view

Two doors down there's a pay phone
But no calls come in
An' two doors down there's a memory
That won't ever end

From the hotel to the barroom
Is just a stumble and a fall
And sometimes when it gets bad
I've been known to crawl

Freedom from sorrow
Is just two doors away
I'll escape for a short time
But I know I can't stay

Two doors down is where they'll find me
When you're finally through
Taking what's left of my life

An' two doors down is where they'll leave me
When payment comes due
For the hours I've spent there each night

Two doors down I'll be forgotten
But until then
Two doors down there's a memory
That won't ever end"
Dwight Yoakam,Then Here Came Monday,"[Verse 1]
Thursday came and went without a reason
But that's the kind of thing that Thursdays will often do
I went to bed knowin' better, then woke up believin'
That I only had Friday to get through

[Verse 2]
Friday's never long, it feels real easy
'Til Saturday winds up just Friday's fool
Then Sunday left to hope, almost decievin'
Me about how I was over you

[Chorus]
Then here came Monday and I remembered how that hurt can feel
The pain goes on and on, it gets really real
Then here came Monday and I remembered where it all went
It looked like I was doin' fine until Monday came along

[Chorus]
Then here came Monday and I remembered how that hurt can feel
The pain goes on and on, it gets really real
Then here came Monday and I remembered where it all went
It looked like I was doin' fine until Monday came along
Yeah I guess I was doin' fine and then Monday came along"
Dwight Yoakam,It Only Hurts When I Cry,"[Chorus]
The only time I feel the pain
Is in the sunshine or the rain
And I don't feel no hurt at all
Unless you count when teardrops fall
I tell the truth 'cept when I lie
And it only hurts me when I cry

[Verse 1]
You couldn't tell it by this smile
But my recovery took a while
I worked for days and nights on end
Just to walk and talk again
You can't believe the time it takes
To heal a heart once it breaks

[Chorus]
The only time I feel the pain
Is in the sunshine or the rain
And I don't feel no hurt at all
Unless you count when teardrops fall
I tell the truth 'cept when I lie
And it only hurts me when I cry

[Verse 2]

Oh maybe every now and then
I have a small heartache again
You wouldn't know to look at me
There's tiny scars that you can't see
It was a struggle to survive
I'm probably lucky I'm alive

[Chorus]
The only time I feel the pain
Is in the sunshine or the rain
And I don't feel no hurt at all
Unless you count when teardrops fall
I tell the truth 'cept when I lie
And it only hurts me when I cry

[Tag]
I tell the truth 'cept when I lie
And it only hurts me when I cry"
Dwight Yoakam,Pocket Of A Clown,"Inside the pocket of a clown
Is a sad place to hang around
Just watching smiles turn into frowns
Inside the pocket of a clown

Inside the heartache of a fool
You'll learn things they don't teach in school
And lessons there can be real cruel
Inside the heartache of a fool

Hollow lies, make a thin disguise
As little drops of truth fall from your eyes

Hollow lies, make a thin disguise
As little drops of truth fall from your eyes

Inside a memory from the past
Lives every love that didn't last
Sweet dreams can start to fade real fast
Inside a memory from the past

It's a real sad place to hang around
Inside the pocket of a clown"
Dwight Yoakam,Little Ways,"[Chorus]
You've got your little ways to hurt me
You know just how to tear me up
And leave me in small pieces on the ground
You've got your little ways to hurt me
They're not too big but they're real tough
Just one cold look from you can knock me down

[Verse 1]
To look at you and me, no one would ever know
The pain that I've endured 'cause I won't let it show
My friends would laugh out loud if they only knew
The truth about how I am just your lovesick fool

[Chorus]
'Cause you've got your little ways to hurt me
You know just how to tear me up
And leave me in small pieces on the ground
And you've got your little ways to hurt me
They're not too big but they're real tough
Just one cold look from you can knock me down

[Verse 2]
The sadness in my eyes should somehow be a clue
But no one here would ever suspect sweet little you
There've been rumors of the truth but I've kept it quiet
'Cause I'm too ashamed to let them know you make me cry

[Chorus]
And you've got your little ways to hurt me
You know just how to tear me up
And leave me in small pieces on the ground
You've got your little ways to hurt me
They're not too big but they're real tough
Just one cold look from you can knock me down
Yeah, your little ways can knock me to the ground"

Gene Autry,Red River Valley,"From this valley they say you are goin'
I will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile
For they say you are takin' the sunshine
That has brightened our pathway the while

Do you think of the valley you're leavin'
Oh, how lonely and dreary it will be
Do you think of the fond heart you're breakin'
And the sadness you've cast over me

For a long time my dear, I've been waiting
For the words that you never would say
And alas my poor heart you are breakin'
For they tell me you're goin' away

As you go to your home by the ocean
May you never forget those sweet hours
That we spent in the Red River Valley
And the love we exchanged mid the flowers

Come and sit by my side if you love me
Do not hasten to bid me adieu
But remember the Red River Valley
And the one that has loved you so true"
Gene Autry,You Are My Sunshine,"You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are grey
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

The other night dear, as I lay sleeping
I dreamt I held you in my arms
When I awoke, dear, I was mistaken
So I hung my head and cried

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are grey
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

I'll always love you and make you happy
If you will only say the same
But if you leave me to love another
You'll regret it all some day

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are grey
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

You told me once dear, you really loved me
And no one else dear, could come between
But now you've left me and love another
You have shattered all my dreams

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are grey
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away"
Gene Autry,Deep In The Heart Of Texas,"[Verse: Gene and All]
The stars at night
Are big and bright
Deep in the heart of Texas

The prairie sky
Is wide and high
Deep in the heart of Texas

The coyotes wail
Along the trail
Deep in the heart of Texas

The rabbits rush
Around the brush
Deep in the heart of Texas

[Verse: Gene and All]
The chicken hocks
Are full of squawks
Deep in the heart of Texas

The oil wells
Are full of smells
Deep in the heart of Texas

The cactus plants
Are tough on pants
Deep in the heart of Texas

That's why perhaps
They all wear chaps
Deep in the heart of Texas

[Instrumental break]

[Verse: Gene and All]
The cowboys cry
""Ka-yippie aye!"" (Woo-hoo!)
Deep in the heart of Texas

The doggies bawl
And say ""you all""

The cactus plants
Are tough on pants
Deep in the heart of Texas

That's why perhaps
They all wear chaps
Deep in the heart of Texas"
Gene Autry,The Yellow Rose Of Texas,"[Verse 1]
There's a yellow rose in Texas I'm going back to see
No other fella knows her, nobody else but me
She cried so when I left her it led to broke her heart
And if we ever meet again, we nevermore shall part

[Chorus]
She's the sweetest rose of color this fellow ever knew
Her eyes are light as diamonds, they sparkle like the dew
You may talk about your dearest maids and sing of Rosalee
But the Yellow Rose of Texas beats the Belles of Tennessee

[Verse 3]
Where the Rio Grande is flowing and the stars are shining bright
We walked along the river on a quiet summer night
She said, ""If you remember, we parted long ago""
I promised to come back again and not to leave her so

[Chorus]
She's the sweetest rose of color this fellow ever knew
Her eyes are bright as diamonds, they sparkle like the dew
You may talk about your dearest maids and sing of Rosalee
But the Yellow Rose of Texas beats the Belles of Tennessee

[Verse 3]
Oh, I'm going back to find her for my heart is full of woe
We'll sing the songs together we sang so long ago
I'll pick the banjo gaily and sing the songs of yore
And the Yellow Rose of Texas shall be mine forevermore

[Chorus]
She's the sweetest rose of color this fellow ever knew
Her eyes are bright as diamonds, they sparkle like the dew
You may talk about your dearest maids and sing of Rosalee
But the Yellow Rose of Texas beats the Belles of Tennessee"

Out jumps good old Santa Claus
Down through the chimney with lots of toys
All for the little ones, Christmas joys

One that can open and shut its eyes

Gene Autry,Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,"You know Dasher, and Dancer, and Prancer, and Vixen
Comet, and Cupid, and Donner, and Blitzen
But do you recall
The most famous reindeer of all?

Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
""Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""
Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
""Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
You'll go down in history""

Gene Autry,I’ve Got Spurs That Jingle Jangle Jingle,"Yippy yeah, there'll be no wedding bells for today

Gene Autry,Frosty the Snowman,"Frosty the snowman
Was a jolly happy soul
With a corn cob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal

Frosty the snowman
Is a fairy tale, they say
He was made of snow, but the children know
That he came to life one day

There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around

Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

Frosty the snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day
So he said ""Let's run and have some fun
Now before I melt away.""

Down to the village
With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there, all around the square
Saying, ""Catch me if you can!""

He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
He only paused a moment
When they heard him holler, ""Stop!""

Frosty the snowman
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye saying, ""Don't you cry
I'll be back again, someday."""
Gene Autry,Back in the Saddle Again,"[Verse 1]
I'm back in the saddle again
Out where a friend is a friend
Where the longhorn cattle feed
On the lowly jimson weed

Ridin' the range once more
Totin' my old .44
Where you sleep out every night
And the only law is right

Back in the saddle again

Gene Autry,Sioux City Sue,"I drove a herd of cattle down from old Nebraska way
That's how I come to be in the state of Iowa
I met a gal in Iowa, her eyes were big and blue
I asked her what her name was, she said, Sioux City Sue

Sioux City Sue, Sioux City Sue
Your hair is red, your eyes are blue
I'd swap my horse and dog for you
Sioux City Sue, Sioux City Sue
There ain't no gal as true as my sweet Sioux City Sue

I asked her if she had a beau, she said, ""Yes quite a few""
But still I started courtin' my sweet Sioux City Sue
The first time that I stole a kiss, I caught her stealing two
I asked her did she love me, She said, ""Indeed I do""

Sioux City Sue, Sioux City Sue
Your hair is red, your eyes are blue
I'd swap my horse and dog for you
Sioux City Sue, my Sioux City Sue
There ain't no gal as true as my sweet Sioux City Sue

I'm admitting Iowa, I owe a lot to you
'Cause I come from Nebraska to find Sioux City Sue
I'm gonna rope and tie her up, I'll use my old lasso
I'm gonna put my brand on my sweet Sioux City Sue

Gene Autry,South of the Border (Down Mexico Way),"South of the Border, down Mexico way
That's where I fell in love
When stars above came out to play
And now as I wander
My thoughts ever stray
South of the border, down Mexico way

She was a picture in old Spanish lace
Just for a tender while
I kissed the smile upon her face
For it was ""Fiesta"" and we were so gay
South of the border, down Mexico way

Then she sighed as she whispered ""Mañana""
Never dreaming that we were parting
And I lied as I whispered ""Mañana""
For that tomorrow never came

South of the border, I rode back one day
There in a veil of white
By candlelight she knelt to pray
The bells told me that I mustn't stay
South of the border, down Mexico way
Ay-ay-ay-ay, (Ay-ay-ay-ay,) etc"

Things to make your Easter bright and gay

When you find those chocolate bunnies
That he's hiding everywhere

Oh, here comes Peter Cottontail
Hoppin' down the bunny trail
Hippity hoppity, happy Easter Day

Gene Autry,Here Comes Santa Claus (Right Down Santa Claus Lane) (1957 Re-recording),"[Intro, spoken]
Speaking of Christmas spirit, each year out in Hollywood, California, they have what they call a Santa Claus parade. A few years ago while I was riding in this parade, I saw smiles on thousands of faces, both young and old alike, waiting for a look at that most popular man all over the world

I can hear them shouting now
""Here comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus...""

[Verse 1]
Here comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus Lane
Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer
Pullin' on the reins
Bells are ringin', children singin'
All is merry and bright
So hang your stockings and say your prayers
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

[Verse 2]
Here comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus Lane
He's got a bag that's filled with toys
For boys and girls again
Hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle
Oh, what a beautiful sight
So jump in bed and cover your head
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Here comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus Lane
He'll come around when the chimes ring out
That it's Christmas morn again
Peace on earth will come to all
If we just follow the light
So let's give thanks to the Lord above
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

[Verse 4]
Here comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus Lane

Gallopin', gallopin', gallopin', gallopin'

Over the moon so bright
Thirty-two feet and eight little tails of white
Hurry, hurry, hurry through the night

Gallopin', gallopin', gallopin', gallopin'

Ol' Saint Nick he works so quickly leavin' toys for girls and boys
Then over the roof so high
Thirty-two feet and eight little tails they fly
Faster, faster, faster through the sky

Gene Autry,Tumbling Tumbleweeds,"I'm a roaming cowboy, riding all day long
Tumbleweeds around me sing their lonely song
Nights underneath a prairie moon
I ride alone and sing a tune
See them tumbling down
Pledging their love to the ground
Lonely but free I'll be found
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds
Cares of the past are behind
Nowhere to go but I'll find
Just where the trail will wind
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds
I know when night has gone that a new world's born at dawn
I'll keep rolling along
Deep in my heart is a song
Here on the range I belong
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds"

Oh-dah-lay-heee

Tramping down the highway, traveling day and night
I don't know where I'm going to, but I'll get there all right
I have no one to care for me, I have no place to go
Everybody knows I'm just a yodeling hobo

(Yodel)

I've been all around the country, been around most everywhere
But I love that dear ol' sunny South, I love that Texas air
Away out where the men are men, down in El Paso
That is where they call me a yodeling hobo

(Yodel)

All my life I've traveled, I'm Alabama bound
And now I'm always happy in the city or one horse town
I started out to roamin' 'cause I had no place to go
Now I've turned out to be a yodeling hobo

(Yodel)

Now you have heard my story, so I'll be on my way
I hear a Frisco freight train, and it's calling me
And when the sun sinks in the West, into that dark blue sky
Just say that I'm a hobo and will be till I die

Gene Autry,Old Soldiers Never Die,"[Intro]
Fade away, fade away

[Chorus]
Old soldiers never die
Never die, never die
Old soldiers never die
They just fade away

[Verse 1]
On the seventh of December
In the year of '41
The free world met disaster
At the hands of the Rising Sun
From the bastions of Corregidor
Pearl Harbor and Bataan
Came the sound of war and fury
And the death march of freeman

[Chorus]
Old soldiers never die
Never die, never die
Old soldiers never die
They just fade away
Old soldiers never die

[Verse 2]
Then from the land of way down under
A mighty voice did say
Our cause is just, in God we trust
I will return someday
From Mindanao to Tarawa
Our battle song it grew
Until on Suribachi
At last old glory flew

[Chorus]
Old soldiers never die
Never die, never die
Old soldiers never die
They just fade away
Old soldiers never die

[Verse 3]
From Iwo, Leyte, and a Thousand Isles
Our just cause never ceased
Until one day, he did return
And once more, there was peace
And now somewhere, there stands the man
His duty o'er and won
The world will never forget him
To him, we say, ""Well done""

[Chorus]
Old soldiers never die
Never die, never die
Old soldiers never die
They just fade away
Old soldiers never die"
Gene Autry,You’re the Only Star in My Blue Heaven,"Stars may come and stars may go
Way up in the heavenly blue
But of all the stars that shine tonight
None shines as bright as you

You're the only star in my blue heaven
And you're shining just for me
You're the only star in my blue heaven
And in dreams your face I see

It seems that when I'm lonely
I always knew you're near

You're the only star in my blue heaven
And you're shining for me here"

Git along little dogie, git along, git along
Git along little dogie, git along, git along
Git along little dogie, git along, git along

I'm heading for the last roundup
To the far away ranch of the Boss in the sky
Where the strays are counted and branded there go I
I'm heading for the last roundup

(CHORUS)
I'm heading for the last roundup
There'll be Buffalo Bill with his long snow-white hair
There'll be old Kit Carson and Custer waiting there
A-riding in the last roundup

Gene Autry,Don’t Fence Me In,"Oh, give me land, lots of land under starry skies above
Don't fence me in
Let me ride through the wide open country that I love
Don't fence me in

Let me be by myself in the evenin' breeze
Listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees
Send me off forever but I ask you please
Don't fence me in

Just turn me loose, let me straddle my old saddle
Underneath the western skies
On my cayuse, let me wander over yonder
Till I see the mountains rise

I want to ride to the ridge where the west commences
Gaze at the moon till I lose my senses
Can't look at hobbles and I can't stand fences
Don't fence me in

Just turn me loose, let me straddle my old saddle
Underneath the western skies
On my cayuse, let me wander over yonder
Till I see the mountains rise

I want to ride to the ridge where the west commences
Gaze at the moon till I lose my senses
Can't look at hobbles and I can't stand fences
Don't fence me in"
Gene Autry,Santa’s Comin’ In A Whirlybird,"Whirlybird, whirlybird, whirlybird, whirlybird
Santa's coming in a whirlybird

The news is out and I've been told
It came by wire from the great North Pole
I'm sure each boy and girly heard
Santa Claus has got a new whirlybird

Santa's coming in a whirlybird
Christmas night in a whirlybird
So, if you're good and you don't goof
The whirlybird's gonna land on your roof
Whirlybird, whirlybird, whirlybird, whirlybird
Santa's coming in a whirlybird

He turned his reindeer out to graze
Donner and Blitzen were amazed
But Rudolph said with a happy shout
""Let's go with Santa and help him out.""

Santa's coming in a whirlybird
Christmas night in a whirlybird
So, if you're good and you don't goof
The whirlybird's gonna land on your roof
Whirlybird, whirlybird, whirlybird, whirlybird
Santa's coming in a whirlybird

I know that it may sound absurd
Santa bringing toys in a whirlybird
But he's been checking with the U.S. mail
And with a helicopter he can't fail

Santa's coming in a whirlybird
Christmas night in a whirlybird
So, if you're good and you don't goof
The whirlybird's gonna land on your roof
Whirlybird, whirlybird, whirlybird, whirlybird
Santa's coming in a whirlybird

There's a bike for Mike and Moe
A talking doll for Jane and Jo
There'll be toys for every child
If you promise not to drive Mom and Daddy wild

Santa's coming in a whirlybird
Christmas night in a whirlybird

Gene Autry,If It Doesn’t Snow On Christmas,"Santa works all day in his workshop
Making lots of games and toys
Then one day, he hops in his sleigh
To bring them to the girls and boys
Santa's just as nice as he can be
There's just one little thing that worries me

If it doesn't snow on Christmas
How is Santa goin' to use his sleigh
In case of rain, will there be a train
That'll speed him on his way
If it doesn't snow on Christmas
How will Santa get around to us
If he breaks down on his way to town
Will they let him use a bus?
I sent him a nice long letter
And I hope it's not in vain
I'd really feel much better
If I knew he could fly a plane

People say he has eight reindeer
For the sleigh he's driving here
But how'll he go, if it doesn't snow
On Christmas this year

If it doesn't snow on Christmas
How is Santa goin' to use his sleigh
In case of rain, will there be a train
That'll speed him on his way
If it doesn't snow on Christmas
How will Santa get around to us
If he breaks down on his way to town
Will they let him use a bus?
I sent him a nice long letter
And I hope it's not in vain

On Christmas this year"
Gene Autry,Nine Little Reindeer,"A long long time ago
As all you folks should know
Ol' Santa started loading up his sleigh
A smile on every face
Each reindeer took his place
To bring us joy on Christmas Day
With one little, two little, three little reindeer
Four little, five little, six little reindeer
Seven little, eight little, yes eight little reindeer
Pulling Santa's sleigh

There's Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comit, Cupid, Donder, Blitzen
But there's one little reindeer missing Rudolf is his name

For a long long time
He had hitched up nine
To make his Christmas ride
Now Rudolph’s gone
He’s so alone
Santa Claus sat down and cried

With one little, two little, three little reindeer
Four little, five little, six little reindeer
Seven little, eight little, yes eight little reindeer
Pulling Santa's sleigh

It's been a year
Since we’ve been here
And how the time it goes
Where have you been
My little friend
Shining up my nose

With one little, two little, three little reindeer
Four little, five little, six little reindeer
Seven little, eight little, nine little reindeer
Pulling Santa's sleigh

Peace on earth and goodwill to all
And a very merry Christmas day"
Gene Autry,When It’s Springtime In The Rockies,"When it's springtime in the Rockies
I'm coming back to you
Little sweetheart of the mountains
With your bonnie eyes of blue

Once again I'll say I love you
While the birds sing all the day
When it's springtime in the Rockies
In the Rockies far away

The twilight shadows deepen into night, dear
The city lights are gleaming o'er the snow
I sit alone beside the cheery fire, dear
I'm dreaming dreams from out the long ago

I fancy, it is springtime in the Rockies
The flowers with their colors are aflame
And though I long to be back in the Rockies
I'll wait until the springtime comes again

When it's springtime in the Rockies
I'm coming back to you
Little sweetheart of the mountains
With your bonnie eyes of blue

Once again I'll say I love you
While the birds sing all the day
When it's springtime in the Rockies
In the Rockies far away"
Taylor Swift,All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor’s Version) [From The Vault],"[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

[Verse 2]
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now
He's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah

[Bridge]
Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all

[Verse 4]
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""

[Verse 5]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 6]
And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

[Outro]
Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it (All too well)
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it"
Taylor Swift,All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor’s Version) [Live Acoustic],"[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

[Verse 2]
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You told me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Key chain on the ground, we were always skipping town
And I was thinking on the drive down, any time now
He's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearing it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah

[Bridge]
Well, maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all

[Verse 4]
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new Hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weeping in a party bathroom
Some actress asking me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sipping coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""

[Verse 5]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 6]
And I was never good at telling jokes, but the punch line goes
""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you, too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

[Outro]
Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us), all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well

[Spoken Outro]
I love you guys so much"
Taylor Swift,Fortnight,"[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I was supposed to be sent away
But they forgot to come and get me
I was a functioning alcoholic
'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic
All of this to say I hope you're okay
But you're the reason
And no one here's to blame
But what about your quiet treason?

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
And for a fortnight there, we were forever
Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors
Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Post Malone, Post Malone]
All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an endless February
I took the miracle move-on drug, the effects were temporary
And I love you, it's ruining my life
I love you, it's ruining my life
I touched you for only a fortnight
I touched you, but I touched you

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Post Malone]
And for a fortnight there, we were forever
Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors
Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her
And for a fortnight there, we were together
Run into you sometimes, comment on my sweater
Now you're at the mailbox, turned into good neighbors
My husband is cheating, I wanna kill him

[Bridge: Taylor Swift, Post Malone, Taylor Swift & Post Malone]
I love you, it's ruining my life
I love you, it's ruining my life
I touched you for only a fortnight
I touched you, I touched you
I love you, it's ruining my life
I love you, it's ruining my life
I touched you for only a fortnight
I touched you, I touched you

[Outro: Post Malone, Post Malone & Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift]
Thought of callin' ya, but you won't pick up
'Nother fortnight lost in America
Move to Florida, buy the car you want
But it won't start up 'til you touch, touch, touch me
Thought of calling ya, but you won't pick up
'Nother fortnight lost in America
Move to Florida, buy the car you want
But it won't start up 'til I touch, touch, touch you"
Taylor Swift,cardigan,"[Verse 1]
Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

[Chorus]
But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

[Verse 2]
A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

[Chorus]
But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends, I
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

[Bridge]
To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'

[Chorus]
'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin' like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing

[Verse 3]
But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite"
Taylor Swift,"So Long, London","[Intro]
So (So) long (Long), London (London)
So (So) long (Long), London (London)
So (So) long (Long), London (London)
[Verse 1]
I saw in my mind fairy lights through the mist
I kept calm and carried the weight of the rift
Pulled him in tighter each time he was driftin' away
My spine split from carrying us up the hill
Wet through my clothes, weary bones caught the chill
I stopped tryna make him laugh, stopped tryna drill the safe

[Chorus]
Thinkin', ""How much sad did you think I had
Did you think I had in me?""
Oh, the tragedy
So long, London
You'll find someone

[Verse 2]
I didn't opt in to be your odd man out
I founded the club she's heard great things about
I left all I knew, you left me at the house by the Heath
I stoppеd CPR, after all, it's no use
The spirit was gonе, we would never come to
And I'm pissed off you let me give you all that youth for free

[Chorus]
For so long, London
Stitches undone
Two graves, one gun
I'll find someone

[Bridge]
And you say I abandoned the ship
But I was going down with it
My white-knuckle dying grip
Holding tight to your quiet resentment
And my friends said it isn't right to be scared
Every day of a love affair
Every breath feels like rarest air
When you're not sure if he wants to be there
[Chorus]
So how much sad did you think I had
Did you think I had in me?
How much tragedy?
Just how low did you
Think I'd go 'fore I'd self-implode?
'Fore I'd have to go be free?

[Verse 3]
You swore that you loved me, but where were the clues?
I died on the altar waitin' for the proof
You sacrificed us to the gods of your bluest days
And I'm just getting color back into my face
I'm just mad as hell 'cause I loved this place for

[Chorus]
So (So) long (Long), London (London)
Had (Had) a (A) good (Good) run (Run)
A moment (Moment) of warm sun (Sun)
But I'm (I'm) not (Not) the (The) one (One)
So (So) long (Long), London (London)
Stitches (Stitches) undone (Undone)
Two (Two) graves (Graves) one gun (Gun)
You'll (You'll) find (Find) someone"
Taylor Swift,The Tortured Poets Department,"[Verse 1]
You left your typewriter at my apartment
Straight from the tortured poets department
I think some things I never say
Like, ""Who uses typewriters anyway?""
But you're in self-sabotage mode
Throwing spikes down on the road
But I've seen this episode and still loved the show
Who else decodes you?

[Chorus]
And who's gonna hold you like me?
And who's gonna know you, if not me?
I laughed in your face and said
""You're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith
This ain't the Chelsea Hotel, we'rе modern idiots""
And who's gonna hold you like me?

[Post-Chorus]
Nobody
No-fucking-body
Nobody

[Verse 2]
You smokеd, then ate seven bars of chocolate
We declared Charlie Puth should be a bigger artist
I scratch your head, you fall asleep
Like a tattooed golden retriever
But you awaken with dread
Pounding nails in your head
But I've read this one where you come undone
I chose this cyclone with you

[Chorus]
And who's gonna hold you like me?
(Who's gonna hold you? Who's gonna hold you?)
And who's gonna know you like me?
(Who's gonna know you?)
I laughed in your face and said
""You're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith
This ain't the Chelsea Hotel, we're modern idiots""
And who's gonna hold you like me?
(Who's gonna hold you? Who's gonna hold you?)

[Post-Chorus]
No-fucking-body
(Who's gonna hold you? Who's gonna hold you?)
Nobody
(Who's gonna hold you? Gonna know you? Gonna troll you?)
Nobody

[Bridge]
Sometimes, I wonder if you're gonna screw this up with me
But you told Lucy you'd kill yourself if I ever leave
And I had said that to Jack about you, so I felt seen
Everyone we know understands why it's meant to be
'Cause we're crazy
So tell me, who else is gonna know me?
At dinner, you take my ring off my middle finger
And put it on the one people put wedding rings on
And that's the closest I've come to my heart exploding

[Chorus]
Who's gonna hold you? (Who?)
Me
Who's gonna know you? (Who?)
Me
And you're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith
This ain't the Chelsea Hotel, we're two idiots
Who's gonna hold you?

[Post-Chorus]
Who's gonna hold you?
Who's gonna hold you?
Who's gonna hold you?
Who's gonna hold you?
Who's gonna hold you?
Who's gonna hold you?
Who's gonna hold you?
Gonna know you? Gonna troll you?

You left your typewriter at my apartment

Taylor Swift,exile,"[Verse 1: Justin Vernon]
I can see you standing, honey
With his arms around your body
Laughin', but the joke's not funny at all
And it took you five whole minutes
To pack us up and leave me with it
Holdin' all this love out here in the hall

[Chorus: Justin Vernon]
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before

[Post-Chorus: Justin Vernon]
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
I can see you starin', honey
Like he's just your understudy
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
Second, third, and hundredth chances
Balancin' on breaking branches
Those eyes add insult to injury

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
I'm not your problem anymore
So who am I offending now?
You were my crown, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leaving out the side door
[Bridge: Justin Vernon, Taylor Swift & Both]
So step right out, there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out (You didn't even hear me out)
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
All this time
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
So many signs, so many signs
You didn't even see the signs

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon, Taylor Swift]
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leavin' out the side door

[Outro: Justin Vernon & Taylor Swift]
So step right out, there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out (Didn't even hear me out)
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
All this time
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
You never gave a warning sign (All this time)
(So many signs) I never learned to read your mind
(So many signs) I couldn't turn things around (I couldn't turn things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (You never gave a warning sign)
You never gave a warning sign
Ah, ah"
Taylor Swift,Lover,"[Verse 1]
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?
[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Verse 2]
We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all
[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Bridge]
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover
[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover"
Taylor Swift,Down Bad,"[Verse 1]
Did you really beam me up
In a cloud of sparkling dust
Just to do experiments on?
Tell me I was the chosen one
Showed me that this world is bigger than us
Then sent me back where I came from

[Pre-Chorus]
For a moment, I knew cosmic love

[Chorus]
Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym
Everything comes out teenage petulance
""Fuck it if I can't have him""
""I might just die, it would make no difference""
Down bad, wakin' up in blood
Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
Fuck it if I can't have us
I might just not get up, I might stay

[Post-Chorus]
Down bad
Fuck it if I can't have him
Down bad
Fuck it if I can't have him

[Verse 2]
Did you take all my old clothes
Just to leave me here, naked and alone
In a field in my same old town
That somehow seems so hollow now?
They'll say I'm nuts if I talk about
The existence of you

[Pre-Chorus]
For a moment, I was heavenstruck

[Chorus]
Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym (Cryin' at the gym)
Everything comes out teenage petulance
""Fuck it if I can't have him"" (Fuck it if I can't have him)
""I might just die, it would make no difference""
Down bad, wakin' up in blood (Wakin' up in blood)
Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
Fuck it if I can't have us
I might just not get up, I might stay

[Post-Chorus]
Down bad (Like I lost my twin)
Fuck it if I can't have him (Down bad)
Down bad (Wavin' at the ship)
Fuck it if I can't have him

[Bridge]
I loved your hostile takeovers
Encounters closer and closer
All your indecent exposures
How dare you say that it's—
I'll build you a fort on some planet
Where they can all understand it
How dare you think it's romantic
Leaving me safe and stranded
'Cause fuck it, I was in love
So fuck you if I can't have us
'Cause fuck it, I was in love

[Chorus]
Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym (Cryin' at the gym)
Everything comes out teenage petulance
""Fuck it if I can't have him"" (Can't have him)
""I might just die, it would make no difference""
Down bad, wakin' up in blood (Wakin' up in blood)
Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
Fuck it if I can't have us
I might just not get up, I might stay

[Post-Chorus]
Down bad (Like I lost my twin)
Fuck it if I can't have him (I'm down bad)
Down bad (Wavin' at the ship)
Fuck it if I can't have him

Like I lost my twin
Fuck it if I can't have him
Down bad (Wavin' at the ship)
Fuck it if I can't have him"
Taylor Swift,loml,"[Verse 1]
Who's gonna stop us from waltzing back into rekindled flames
If we know the steps anyway?
We embroidered the memories of the time I was away
Stitching, ""We were just kids, babe""
I said, ""I don't mind, it takes time""
I thought I was better safe than starry-eyed
I felt aglow like this
Never before and never since

[Chorus]
If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary
You and I go from one kiss to getting married
Still alivе, killing time at the cemеtery
Never quite buried
In your suit and tie, in the nick of time
You low-down boy, you stand-up guy
You Holy Ghost, you told me I'm the love of your life
You said I'm the love of your life
About a million times

[Verse 2]
Who's gonna tell me the truth when you blew in with the winds of fate
And told me I reformed you?
When your impressionist paintings of heaven turned out to be fakes
Well, you took me to hell too
And all at once, the ink bleeds
A con man sells a fool a get-love-quick scheme
But I've felt a hole like this
Never before and ever since

[Chorus]
If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary
What we thought was for all time was momentary
Still alive, killing time at the cemetery
Never quite buried
You cinephile in black and white
All those plot twists and dynamite
Mr. Steal Your Girl, then make her cry
You said I'm the love of your life

[Bridge]
You shit-talked me under the table
Talkin' rings and talkin' cradles
I wish I could un-recall
How we almost had it all
Dancing phantoms on the terrace
Are they second-hand embarrassed
That I can't get out of bed
'Cause something counterfeit's dead?
It was legendary
It was momentary
It was unnecessary
Should've let it stay buried

[Chorus]
Oh, what a valiant roar
What a bland goodbye
The coward claimed he was a lion
I'm combing through the braids of lies
""I'll never leave,"" ""Never mind""
Our field of dreams engulfed in fire
Your arson's match, your somber eyes
And I'll still see it until I die
You're the loss of my life"
Taylor Swift,But Daddy I Love Him,"[Verse 1]
I forget how the West was won
I forget if this was ever fun
I just learned these people only raise you
To cage you
Sarahs and Hannahs in their Sunday best
Clutchin' their pearls, sighing, ""What a mess""
I just learned these people try and save you
'Cause they hate you

[Pre-Chorus]
Too high a horse
For a simple girl
To rise above it
They slammed the door
On my whole world
The one thing I wanted

[Chorus]
Now I'm runnin' with my dress unbuttoned
Scrеamin', ""But, Daddy, I love him""
I'm havin' his baby
No, I'm not, but you should see your faces
I'm tellin' him to floor it through thе fences
No, I'm not coming to my senses
I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want

[Verse 2]
Dutiful daughter, all my plans were laid
Tendrils tucked into a woven braid
Growin' up precocious sometimes means
Not growin' up at all
He was chaos, he was revelry
Bedroom eyes like a remedy
Soon enough, the elders had convened
Down at the city hall

[Pre-Chorus]
""Stay away from her""
The saboteurs
Protested too much
Lord knows the words
We never heard
Just screeching tires and true love

[Chorus]
And I'm runnin' with my dress unbuttoned
Screamin', ""But, Daddy, I love him""
I'm havin' his baby
No, I'm not, but you should see your faces
I'm tellin' him to floor it through the fences
No, I'm not coming to my senses
I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want

[Post-Chorus]
I'll tell you something right now
I'd rather burn my whole life down
Than listen to one more second of all this bitchin' and moanin'
I'll tell you something 'bout my good name
It's mine alone to disgrace
I don't cater to all these vipers dressed in empath's clothing

[Bridge]
God save the most judgmental creeps
Who say they want what's best for me
Sanctimoniously performing soliloquies I'll never see
Thinkin' it can change the beat
Of my heart when he touches me
And counteract the chemistry
And undo the destiny
You ain't gotta pray for me
Me and my wild boy and all of this wild joy
If all you want is gray for me
Then it's just white noise, and it's just my choice

[Verse 3]
There's a lot of people in town that I
Bestow upon my fakest smiles
Scandal does funny things to pride, but brings lovers closer
We came back when the heat died down
Went to my parents and they came around
All the wine moms are still holdin' out, but fuck 'em, it's over

[Chorus]
Now I'm dancin' in my dress in the sun and
Even my daddy just loves him
I'm his lady
And, oh my God, you should see your faces
Time, doesn't it give some perspective?
And, no, you can't come to the wedding
I know it's crazy, but he's the one I want

[Post-Chorus]
I'll tell you something right now
You ain't gotta pray for me
Me and my wild boy and all of this wild joy
(He was chaos, he was revelry)
If all you want is gray for me
Then it's just white noise, and it's my choice

[Outro]
Screamin', ""But, Daddy, I love him""
I'm having his baby
No, I'm not
But you should see your faces
But, oh my God, you should see your faces
(He was chaos, he was revelry)
(He was chaos, he was revelry)"
Taylor Swift,Is It Over Now? (Taylor’s Version) [From The Vault],"[Intro]
(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 1]
Once the flight had flown (Uh-huh)
With the wilt of the rose (Uh-huh)
I slept all alone (Uh-huh)
You still wouldn't go

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later
I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
You search in every maiden's bed for somethin' greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
""Come here,"" I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passеd out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 2]
Whеn you lost control (Uh-huh)
Red blood, white snow (Uh-huh)
Blue dress on a boat (Uh-huh)
Your new girl is my clone

[Bridge]
And did you think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin'
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred awkward blind dates later (Oh)
If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her (Oh, no)
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor (Oh)
You search in every model's bed for somethin' greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
""Come here,"" I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passed out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?
[Post-Chorus]
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it?)

[Bridge]
Think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin' (Runnin')
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Outro]
(Flashin' lights; Oh, Lord; Oh)
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later (Oh)
(Flashin' lights) I was hoping you'd be there
And say the one thing (Oh, Lord)
I've been wanting (Oh, Lord)
But no
(Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it?)"
Taylor Swift,the 1,"[Verse 1]
I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit
Been saying ""yes"" instead of ""no""
I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though
I hit the ground running each night
I hit the Sunday matinée
You know the greatest films of all time were never made

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess you never know, never know
And if you wanted me, you really should've showed
And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
And it's alright now

[Chorus]
But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
(Ooh)

[Verse 2]
I have this dream you're doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the internet and take her home
We never painted by the numbers, baby
But we were making it count
You know the greatest loves of all time are over now

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess you never know, never know
And it's another day waking up alone

[Chorus]
But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one

[Bridge]
I, I, I persist and resist the temptation to ask you
If one thing had been different
Would everything be different today?

[Chorus]
We were something, don't you think so?
Rosé flowing with your chosen family
And it would've been sweet
If it could've been me
In my defense, I have none
For digging up the grave another time
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
(Ooh)"
Taylor Swift,​thanK you aIMee,"[Verse 1]
When I picture my hometown
There's a bronze, spray-tanned statue of you
And a plaque underneath it
That threatens to push me down the stairs at our school

[Pre-Chorus]
And it was always the same searing pain
But I dreamed that one day I could say

[Chorus]
All that time you were throwin' punches, I was buildin' somethin'
And I can't forgive the way you made me feel
Screamed, ""Fuck you, Aimee"" to the night sky as the blood was gushin'
But I can't forget the way you made me heal

[Verse 2]
And it wasn't a fair fight
Or a clean kill each time that Aimee stompеd across my grave
And then she wrotе headlines
In the local paper, laughing at each baby step I'd take

[Pre-Chorus]
And it was always the same searing pain
But I prayed that one day I could say

[Chorus]
All that time you were throwin' punches, I was buildin' somethin'
And I couldn't wait to show you it was real
Screamed, ""Fuck you, Aimee"" to the night sky as the blood was gushin'
But I can't forget the way you made me heal
Everyone knows that my mother is a saintly woman
But she used to say she wished that you were dead
I pushed each boulder up the hill
Your words are still just ringin' in my head, ringin' in my head

[Bridge]
I wrote a thousand songs that you find uncool
I built a legacy that you can't undo
But when I count the scars, there's a moment of truth
That there wouldn't be this if there hadn't been you

[Verse 3]
And maybe you've reframed it
And in your mind, you never beat my spirit black and blue
I don't think you've changed much
And so I changed your name and any real defining clues
And one day, your kid comes home singin'
A song that only us two is gonna know is about you, 'cause

[Chorus]
All that time you were throwin' punches, it was all for nothin'
And our town, it looks so small from way up here
Screamed, ""Thank you, Aimee"" to the night sky and the stars are stunnin'
'Cause I can't forget the way you made me heal
Everyone knows that my mother is a saintly woman
But she used to say she wished that you were dead
So I pushed each boulder up that hill
Your words were still just ringin' in my head, ringin' in my head

[Outro]
Thank you, Aimee
Thank you, Aimee"
Taylor Swift,august,"[Verse 1]
Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of ""Are you sure?""
""Never have I ever before""

[Chorus]
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

[Verse 2]
Your back beneath the sun
Wishin' I could write my name on it
Will you call when you're back at school?
I remember thinkin' I had you

[Chorus]
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

[Bridge]
Back when we were still changin' for the better
Wanting was enough
For me, it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case you'd call
And say, ""Meet me behind the mall""
So much for summer love and saying ""us""
'Cause you weren't mine to lose
You weren't mine to lose, no

[Chorus]
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

[Outro]
'Cause you were never mine
Never mine
But do you remember?
Remember when I pulled up and said ""Get in the car""
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
""Meet me behind the mall""
(Remember when I pulled up and said ""Get in the car"")
(And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?)
(Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)
(""Meet me behind the mall"")
Remember when I pulled up and said ""Get in the car""
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all (For the hope of it all)
For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
(For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)"
Taylor Swift,Cruel Summer,"[Intro]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

[Pre-Chorus]
Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

[Chorus]
And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

[Verse 2]
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

[Pre-Chorus]
So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know, oh

[Chorus]
It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

[Bridge]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)
Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?""
He looks up, grinnin' like a devil

[Chorus]
It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

[Outro]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)
Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?""
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)"
Taylor Swift,I Can Do It With a Broken Heart,"[Verse 1]
I can read your mind
""She's having the time of her life""
There in her glittering prime
The lights refract sequin stars off her silhouette every night
I can show you lies
(One, two, three, four)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm a real tough kid
I can handle my shit
They said, ""Babe, you gotta fake it 'til you make it"" and I did
Lights, camera, bitch, smile
Even when you wanna die
He said he'd love me all his life
But that life was too short
Breaking down, I hit the floor
All the piеces of me shatterеd as the crowd was chanting, ""More""
I was grinnin' like I'm winnin'
I was hittin' my marks
'Cause I can do it with a broken heart
(One, two, three, four)
[Chorus]
I'm so depressed, I act like it's my birthday every day
I'm so obsessed with him, but he avoids me like the plague
I cry a lot, but I am so productive, it's an art
You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart

[Verse 2]
I can hold my breath
I've been doin' it since he left
I keep finding his things in drawers
Crucial evidence I didn't imagine the whole thing
I'm sure I can pass this test
(One, two, three, four)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm a real tough kid
I can handle my shit
They said, ""Babe, you gotta fake it 'til you make it"" and I did
Lights, camera, bitch, smile
In stilettos for miles
He said he'd love me for all time
But that time was quite short
Breaking down, I hit the floor
All the pieces of me shattered as the crowd was chanting, ""More""
I was grinnin' like I'm winnin'
I was hittin' my marks
'Cause I can do it with a broken heart
(One, two, three, four)

[Chorus]
I'm so depressed, I act like it's my birthday every day
I'm so obsessed with him, but he avoids me (He avoids me), like the plague
I cry a lot, but I am so productive, it's an art
You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart

[Outro]
You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart
You know you're good
And I'm good
'Cause I'm miserable (Haha)
And nobody even knows
Ah, try and come for my job"
Taylor Swift,​tolerate it,"[Verse 1]
I sit and watch you readin' with your head low
I wake and watch you breathin' with your eyes closed
I sit and watch you
I notice everything you do or don't do
You're so much older and wiser, and I

[Chorus]
I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

[Verse 2]
I greet you with a battle hero's welcome
I take your indiscretions all in good fun
I sit and listеn
I polish plates until they gleam and glistеn
You're so much older and wiser, and I

[Chorus]
I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

[Bridge]
While you were out buildin' other worlds, where was I?
Where's that man who'd throw blankets over my barbed wire?
I made you my temple, my mural, my sky
Now I'm beggin' for footnotes in the story of your life
Drawin' hearts in the byline
Always takin' up too much space or time
You assume I'm fine, but what would you do if I (I)

[Chorus]
Break free and leave us in ruins?
Took this dagger in me and removed it
Gain the weight of you, then lose it
Believe me, I could do it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

[Outro]
I sit and watch you"
Taylor Swift,The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived,"[Verse 1]
Was any of it true?
Gazing at me starry-eyed
In your Jehovah's Witness suit
Who the fuck was that guy?
You tried to buy some pills
From a friend of friends of mine
They just ghosted you
Now you know what it feels like

[Chorus]
And I don't even want you back, I just want to know
If rusting my sparkling summer was the goal
And I don't miss what we had, but could someone give
A message to the smallest man who ever lived?

[Verse 2]
You hung me on your wall
Stabbed me with your push pins
In public, showed me off
Then sank in stoned oblivion
'Cause once your queen had come
You'd treat her likе an also-ran
You didn't measure up
In any measurе of a man

[Chorus]
And I don't even want you back, I just want to know
If rusting my sparkling summer was the goal
And I don't miss what we had, but could someone give
A message to the smallest man who ever lived?

[Bridge]
Were you sent by someone who wanted me dead?
Did you sleep with a gun underneath our bed?
Were you writin' a book? Were you a sleeper cell spy?
In fifty years, will all this be declassified?
And you'll confess why you did it and I'll say, ""Good riddance""
'Cause it wasn't sexy once it wasn't forbidden
I would've died for your sins, instead, I just died inside
And you deserve prison, but you won't get time
You'll slide into inboxes and slip through the bars
You crashed my party and your rental car
You said normal girls were boring
But you were gone by the morning
You kicked out the stage lights, but you're still performing

[Outro]
And in plain sight you hid
But you are what you did
And I'll forget you, but I'll never forgive
The smallest man who ever lived"
Taylor Swift,Guilty as Sin?,"[Verse 1]
Drownin' in the Blue Nile
He sent me ""Downtown Lights""
I hadn't heard it in a while
My boredom's bone-deep
This cage was once just fine
Am I allowed to cry?
I dream of crackin' locks
Throwin' my life to the wolves or the ocean rocks
Crashin' into him tonight, he's a paradox
I'm seeing visions
Am I bad or mad or wise?

[Chorus]
What if he's written ""mine"" on my upper thigh only in my mind?
One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze
Oh, what a way to die
I keep recalling things we never did
Messy top-lip kiss, how I long for our trysts
Without ever touchin' his skin
How can I be guilty as sin?

[Verse 2]
I keep these longings lockеd
In lowercase, inside a vault
Somеone told me, ""There's no such thing as bad thoughts
Only your actions talk""
These fatal fantasies
Giving way to labored breath, takin' all of me
We've already done it in my head
If it's make-believe
Why does it feel like a vow we'll both uphold somehow?

[Chorus]
What if he's written ""mine"" on my upper thigh only in my mind?
One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze
Oh, what a way to die
My bed sheets are ablaze
I've screamed his name
Buildin' up like waves crashin' over my grave
Without ever touchin' his skin
How can I be guilty as sin?

[Bridge]
What if I roll the stone away?
They're gonna crucify me anyway
What if the way you hold me is actually what's holy?
If long-suffering propriety is what they want from me
They don't know how you've haunted me so stunningly
I choose you and me religiously

[Chorus]
What if he's written ""mine"" on my upper thigh only in my mind?
One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze
Oh, what a way to die
I keep recalling things we never did
Messy top-lip kiss, how I long for our trysts
Without ever touchin' his skin
How can I be guilty as sin?

[Outro]
He sent me ""Downtown Lights""
I hadn't heard it in a while
Am I allowed to cry?"
Taylor Swift,​champagne problems,"[Verse 1]
You booked the night train for a reason
So you could sit there in this hurt
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
You're not sure which is worse

[Chorus]
Because I dropped your hand while dancing
Left you out there standing
Crestfallen on the landing
Champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
My picture in your wallet
Your heart was glass, I dropped it
Champagne problems

[Verse 2]
You told your family for a reason
You couldn't keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Now no one's celebrating

[Chorus]
Dom Pérignon, you brought it
No crowd of friends applauded
Your hometown skeptics called it
Champagne problems
You had a speech, you're speechless
Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldn't give a reason
Champagne problems

[Bridge]
Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
November flush and your flannel cure
""This dorm was once a madhouse""
I made a joke, ""Well, it's made for me""
How evergreen, our group of friends
Don't think we'll say that word again
And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through
One for the money, two for the show
I never was ready so I watch you go
Sometimes you just don't know the answer
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
""She would've made such a lovely bride
What a shame she's fucked in the head,"" they said
But you'll find the real thing instead
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred

[Chorus]
And hold your hand while dancing
Never leave you standing
Crestfallen on the landing
With champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
Her picture in your wallet
You won't remember all my
Champagne problems

[Outro]
You won't remember all my
Champagne problems"
Taylor Swift,Look What You Made Me Do,"[Verse 1]
I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh

[Chorus]
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

[Verse 2]
I (I) don't (Don't) like your kingdom keys (Keys)
They (They) once belonged to me (Me)
You (You) asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast (What?)
The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours

[Pre-Chorus]
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time (Nick of time)
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time (I do it all the time)
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh

[Chorus]
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

[Bridge]
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starrin' in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starrin' in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starrin' in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starrin' in your bad dreams

[Interlude]
(Ooh, look what you made me do)
(Look what you made me do)
(Look what you just made me do)
(Look what you just made me)
""I'm sorry, the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now""
(Ooh, look what you made me do)
(Look what you made me do)
(Look what you just made me)
""Why? Oh, 'cause she's dead"" (Oh)

[Chorus]
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do"
Taylor Swift,Anti-Hero,"[Verse 1]
I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

[Pre-Chorus]
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)

[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed

[Pre-Chorus]
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
(A tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)

[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Bridge]
I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out
""She's laughing up at us from Hell""

[Breakdown]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
Everybody agrees, everybody agrees

[Chorus]
It's me, hi (Hi)
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees (Everybody agrees)
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero"
Taylor Swift,So High School,"[Intro]
I feel so high school every time I look at you
I wanna find you in a crowd just to hide from you

[Chorus]
And in a blink of a crinklin' eye
I'm sinkin', our fingers entwined
Cheeks pink in the twinklin' lights
Tell me 'bout the first time you saw me
I'll drink what you think and I'm high
From smokin' your jokes all damn night
The brink of a wrinkle in time
Bittersweet sixteen suddenly

[Post-Chorus]
I'm watchin' American Pie with you on a Saturday night
Your friends are around, so be quiet
I'm tryin' to stifle my sighs
'Cause I feel so high school every time I look at you
But look at you

[Interlude]
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah

[Verse 1]
Are you gonna marry, kiss, or kill me? (Kill me)
It's just a game, but really (Really)
I'm bettin' on all three (All three) for us two
Get my car door, isn't that sweet? (That sweet)
Then pull me to thе back seat (The back seat)
No onе's ever had me (Had me), not like you

[Refrain]
Truth, dare, spin bottles
You know how to ball, I know Aristotle
Brand new, full throttle
Touch me while your bros play Grand Theft Auto
It's true, swear, scout's honor
You knew what you wanted and, boy, you got her
Brand new, full throttle
You already know, babe

[Verse 2]
I feel like laughin' in the middle of practice
Do that impression you did of your dad again
I'm hearing voices like a madman

[Chorus]
And in a blink of a crinklin' eye
I'm sinkin', our fingers entwined
Cheeks pink in the twinklin' lights
Tell me 'bout the first time you saw me
I'll drink what you think, and I'm high
From smokin' your jokes all damn night
The brink of a wrinkle in time
Bittersweet sixteen suddenly

[Post-Chorus]
I'm watchin' American Pie with you on a Saturday night
Your friends are around, so be quiet
I'm tryin' to stifle my sighs
'Cause I feel so high school (Feel so high school) every time I look at you
But look at you

[Refrain]
Truth, dare, spin bottles
You know how to ball, I know Aristotle
Brand new, full throttle
Touch me while your bros play Grand Theft Auto
It's true, swear, scout's honor (Yeah)
You knew what you wanted and, boy, you got her
Brand new, full throttle (Yeah)
You already know, babe
You already know, babe"
Taylor Swift,betty,"[Verse 1]
Betty, I won't make assumptions
About why you switched your homeroom, but
I think it's 'cause of me
Betty, one time, I was riding on my skateboard
When I passed your house
It's like I couldn't breathe

[Pre-Chorus]
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time, it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

[Chorus]
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Verse 2]
Betty, I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing
From the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
I hate the crowds, you know that
Plus, I saw you dance with him

[Pre-Chorus]
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time, it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

[Chorus]
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Bridge]
I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you when she pulled up like
A figment of my worst intentions
She said, ""James, get in, let's drive""
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her, but
I dreamt of you all summer long

[Verse 3]
Betty, I'm here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now
But it's finally sinkin' in
Betty, right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when
You see my face again

[Pre-Chorus]
The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you
So I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party

[Chorus]
Yeah, I showed up at your party
Will you have me? Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the porch
In front of all your stupid friends?
If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?
Will it patch your broken wings?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Outro]
Standing in your cardigan
Kissin' in my car again
Stopped at a streetlight
You know I miss you"
Roy Acuff,Wabash Cannon Ball (1947),"From the great Atlantic ocean
To the wide Pacific shore
From the queen of flowing mountains
To the southbelt by the shore
She's mighty tall and handsome
And known quite well by all
She's the combination
Called the Wabash Cannonball

She came down from Birmingham
One cold December day
As she rolled into the station
You could hear all the people say
There's a girl from Tennessee
She's long and she's tall
She came down from Birmingham
On the Wabash Cannonball

Our eastern states are dandies
So the people always say
From New York to St. Louis
And Chicago by the way
From the hills of Minnesota
Where the rippling waters fall
No changes can be taken
On the Wabash Cannonball

Here's to Daddy Claxton
May his name forever stand
And always be remembered
'Round the courts of Alabam
His earthly race is over
And the curtains round him fall
We'll carry home to vic'try
On the Wabash Cannonball

Listen to the jingle
And the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodlands
Through the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine
Hear that lonesome hobo squall
You're travlin' through the jungles
On the Wabash Cannonball"
Roy Acuff,The Great Speckle Bird,"What a beautiful thought I am thinking
Concerning a great speckled bird
Remember her name is recorded
On the pages of God's Holy Word

All the other birds are flocking 'round her
And she is despised by the squad
But the great speckled bird in the Bible
Is one with the great church of God

All the other churches are against her
They envy her glory and fame
They hate her because she is chosen
And has not denied Jesus' name

Desiring to lower her standard
They watch every move that she makes
They long to find fault with her teachings
But really they find no mistake

She is spreading her wings for a journey
She's going to leave by and by
When the trumpet shall sound in the morning
She'll rise and go up in the sky

In the presence of all her despisers
With a song never uttered before
She will rise and be gone in a moment
Till the great tribulation is o'er

I am glad I have learned of her meekness
I am proud that my name is on her book
For I want to be one never fearing
The face of my Savior to look

When He cometh descending from heaven
On the cloud that He writes in His word
I'll be joyfully carried to meet Him
On the wings of that great speckled bird"
Roy Acuff,Wreck On The Highway,"Who did you say it was brother?
Who was it fell by the way?
When whiskey and blood run together
Did you hear anyone pray?

[Chorus]
I didn't hear nobody pray, dear brother
I didn't hear nobody pray
I heard the crash on the highway
But, I didn't hear nobody pray

When I heard the crash on the highway
I knew what it was from the start
I went to the scene of destruction
And a picture was stamped on my heart

There was whiskey and blood all together
Mixed with glass where they lay
Death played her hand in destruction
But I didn't hear nobody pray

I wish I could change this sad story
That I am now telling you
But there is no way I can change it
For somebody's life is now through

Their soul has been called by the Master
They died in a crash on the way
And I heard the groans of the dying
But, I didn't hear nobody pray

CHORUS"
Roy Acuff,The Great Titanic,"[Verse 1]
It was on one Monday morning
About one o'clock
When that great Titanic
Began to reel and rock

[Verse 2]
People began to scream and cry
Saying, oh, Lord, we're going to die
It was sad when that great ship went down

[Chorus]
It was sad when that great ship went down
It was sad when that great ship went down
Husbands and their wives, little children lost their lives
It was sad when that great ship went down

[Verse 3]
When building that great ship
They said what they would do
They said that they could build a ship
That water would not go through

[Verse 4]
God with power in his hand
Showed the world it could not stand
It was sad when that great ship went down

[Verse 5]
When that great ship left England
She was making for the shores
When the rich declared
They would not ride with the poor

So they put the poor below
And they were the first to go
It was sad when that great ship went down

[Chorus]
It was sad when that great ship went down
It was sad when that great ship went down
Husbands and their wives, little children lost their lives
It was sad when that great ship went down"
Roy Acuff,Beautiful Brown Eyes,"Beautiful, beautiful brown eyes
Beautiful, beautiful brown eyes
Beautiful, beautiful brown eyes
I'll never love blue eyes again

Down to the barroom he staggered
Fell down by the door
The very last words that he uttered
I'll never get drunk anymore

(chorus)
Willie my darlin' I love you
Love you with all of my heart
Tomorrow we might have been married
But liquor has kept us apart

(chorus)
Seven long years I've been married
Wish I was single again
A woman never really knows trouble
Until she has married a man

Beautiful, beautiful brown eyes
Beautiful, beautiful brown eyes
Beautiful, beautiful brown eyes
I'll never love blue eyes again"
Roy Acuff,Advice to Joe,"There's a Communist ambition now to rule or wreck us all
With atomic ammunition they would like to see us fall
Peaceful men of every nation would become as common slaves
We'll prevent that situation better we shall fill our graves

You will see the lightnin' flashin' hear atomic thunders roll
When Moscow lies in ashes God have you mercy on your soul
Here's a question Mr. Stalin and it's you who must decide
When atomic bombs start falling do you have a place to hide?

Uncle Sam will still be living when the smokе of battle's o'er
He will makе a noose to fit you God will close up Heaven's door
You'll come face to face with Satan see the loved ones who have died
So be sure that when bombs start falling that you have a place to hide

You will see the lightnin' flashin' hear atomic thunders roll
When Moscow lies in ashes God have you mercy on your soul
Here's a question Mr. Stalin and it's you who must decide
When atomic bombs start falling do you have a place to hide?

Just remember Mr. Stalin how we both fought side by side
When Hitler and Mussolini had you whipped and how you cried
Uncle Sammy came to help you gave you strength, we gave you all
And now your great ambition is to see our nation fall

You will see the lightnin' flashin' hear atomic thunders roll
When Moscow lies in ashes God have you mercy on your soul
Here's a question Mr. Stalin and it's you who must decide
When atomic bombs start falling do you have a place to hide?"
Roy Acuff,Fireball Mail,"Here she comes look at her roll there she goes eatin' that coal
Watch her fly huggin' the rails let her by by by it's the fireball mail
[ mandolin ]
Let her go look at her steam hear her blow whistle and scream
Like a hound waggin' his tail Dallas bound bound boud it's the fireball mail
[ dobro ]
Engineer makin' up time tracks are clear look at her climb
See that freight clearin' the rail bet she's late late late it's the fireball mail
[ mandolin ]
Watch her swerve look at her sway get that curve out of the way
Watch her fly look at her sail let her by by by it's the fireball mail

Here she comes look at her roll there she goes eatin' that coal
Watch her fly huggin' the rails let her by by by the fireball mail"
Roy Acuff,Blue Eyes Crying In The Rain,"[Verse 1]
In the twilight glow I see her
Blue eyes crying in the rain
When we kissed goodbye and parted
I knew we'd never meet again

[Verse 2]
Love is like a dying ember
Only memories remain
Through the ages I'll remember
Blue eyes crying in the rain

[Verse 3]
Now my hair has turned to silver
All my life I've loved in vain
I can see her star in heaven
Blue eyes crying in the rain

[Verse 4]
Some day when we meet up yonder
We'll stroll hand in hand again
In a land that knows no parting
Blue eyes crying in the rain"
Roy Acuff,The Great Judgement Morning,"I dreamed that the great judgment morning
Had dawned and the trumpet had blown
I dreamed that all nations had gathered
To judgment before the white throne

From the throne came a bright shining angel
And he stood on the land and the sea
And swore with his hand raised to heaven
That time was no longer to be

And oh what weeping and wailing
As the lost were told of their fate
They cried for the rocks and the mountains
They prayed but their prayers were too late

The rich man was there but his money
Had melted and vanished away
A pauper stood there in the judgment
His debts were too many to pay

The widow was there and the orphan
God heard and remembered their cries
No sorrow in heaven forever
God wiped all the tears from their eyes

And the souls that had put off salvation
Not tonight I'll get saved by and by
No time now to think of religion
At last they must find time to die

And oh what weeping and wailing
As the lost were told of their fate
They cried for the rocks and the mountains
They prayed but their prayers were too late"
Roy Acuff,The Precious Jewel,"Way back in the hills, when a boy, I once wandered
Buried deep in her grave lies a girl that I love
She was called from this earth, a jewel for heaven
More precious than diamonds more precious than gold

When a girl of sixteen, we courted each other
She promised someday to become my sweet wife
I bought her the ring to wear on her finger
But the angels they called her to heaven one night

A jewel here on earth, a jewel up in heaven
She'll brighten the kingdom around God's great throne
May the angels have peace, God bless her in heaven
They've broken my heart and they left me to roam

This world has it wealth, its' trials and troubles
Mother earth holds her treasures of diamonds and gold
But it can't hold the soul of one precious jewel
She's resting in peace with the heavenly fold

May the angels have peace, God bless her in heaven
They've broken my heart and they left me to roam"
Roy Acuff,I Like Mountain Music,"When the Sun goes down and the chores are through
There ain't nothin' better I like to do
Than sit around the house when the folks ain't home
And listen to the music on a gramophone

I like mountain music, good old mountain music
Played by a real hillbilly band
Give me rural rhythm, let me sway right with 'em
I think the melodies are grand

I have heard Hawaiians play in the land of the wicki-wacki
But I must say you can't beat ""Turkey in the straw"", by cracky!
I like mountain music, good old mountain music
Played by a real hillbilly band

To the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee
Came a hula girl from over the sea
With sparkling eyes, lips so red
She looked at me and then she said

I like mountain music, good old mountain music
Played by a real hillbilly band
Give me rural rhythm, let me sway right with 'em
I think the melodies are grand

I have heard Hawaiians play in the land of the wicki-wacki
But I must say you can't beat ""Turkey in the straw"", by cracky!
I like mountain music, good old mountain music
Played by a real hillbilly band

(Instrumental break)

Her flashy clothes are really neat
Flowing hair and dancing feet
When she does the hula, she can drive you wild
Swingin' and swayin' in the mountain style

I like mountain music, good old mountain music
Played by a real hillbilly band
Give me rural rhythm, let me sway right with 'em
I think the melodies are grand

I have heard Hawaiians play in the land of the wicki-wacki
But I must say you can't beat ""Turkey in the straw"", by cracky!
I like mountain music, good old mountain music
Played by a real hillbilly band

(Instrumental break)

While the fiddles play and the guitars ring
The people laugh, you can hear them sing
This hula girl can swing and sway
You can hear her shout to the break of day

I like mountain music, good old mountain music
Played by a real hillbilly band
Give me rural rhythm, let me sway right with 'em
I think the melodies are grand

I have heard Hawaiians play in the land of the wicki-wacki
But I must say you can't beat ""Turkey in the straw"", by cracky!
I like mountain music, good old mountain music
Played by a real hillbilly band"
Roy Acuff,Night Train To Memphis,"Take that Night Train To Memphis
Take that Night Train To Memphis
And when you arrive at the station
I'll be right there to meet you
I'll be right there to greet you
So don't turn down my invitation

CHORUS
Halle-lu-jah! [Halle-lu-jah!]
Halle-lu-jah! [Halle-lu-jah!]
We'll be shoutin' hallelu-jah all the day
Oh we'll have a jubilee
Down in Memphis, Tennessee

CHORUS"
Roy Acuff,Freight Train Blues,"I was born in dixie in a boomer's shack
Just a little old shanty by a railroad track
The hummin' of the drivers was my lullaby
And a freight train whistle taught me how to cry

Chorus:
I've got the freight train blues, lordy, lordy, lordy
Got 'em in the bottom of my ramblin' shoes
And when that whistle blows, I've gotta go
Oh! lordy! guess I'm never gonna lose
The mean old freight train blues

Now my pappy was a fireman and my mammy dear
Was the only daughter of an engineer
My sister married a brakeman and it ain't no joke
Now it's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke

Chorus:
I've got the freight train blues, lordy, lordy, lordy
Got 'em in the bottom of my ramblin' shoes
And when the whistle blows, I've gotta go
Oh! lordy! guess I'm never gonna lose
The mean old freight train blues"
Roy Acuff,This World Can’t Stand Long,"A long time this world has stood
It gets more wicked every day
The maker who created it
Will never let it stand this way

This world can't stand long
Be ready and don't be late
We should know this world can't stand
For it's too full of hate

This world was destroyed before
Because it was so full of sin
And for that very reason now
It's gotta be destroyed again

This world can't stand long
Be ready and don't be late
We should know this world can't stand
For it's too full of hate

Everyone knows this world can't stand
For in the Bible it's plain to see
Fire and brimstone shall rain down
And carry us to eternity

This world can't stand long
Be ready and don't be late
We should know this world can't stand
For it's too full of hate

Let's all give our hearts to God
And let Him lead us by the hand
If we will only trust in Him
He'll lead us beyond the burning sand

This world can't stand long
Be ready and don't be late
We should know this world can't stand
For it's too full of hate"
Roy Acuff,Tell Mother I’ll Be There,"When I was but a little child how well I recollect
How I would grieve my mother with my folly and neglect
And now that she has gone to Heaven I miss her tender care
O Savior tell my mother I'll be there

Tell mother I'll be there in answer to her prayer
This message blessed Savior to her bear
Tell mother I'll be there heaven's joys with her to share
Yes tell my darling mother I'll be there

Though I was often wayward she was always kind and good
So patient gentle loving when my ways were rough and rude
My childhood grief's and trials she would gladly with me share
O Savior tell my mother I'll be there

One day a message came to me it bade me quickly come
If I would see my mother ere the Savior took her home
I promised her before she died for heaven to prepare
O Savior tell my mother I'll be there
Tell mother I'll be there in answer to her prayer
This message blessed Savior to her bear
Tell mother I'll be there heaven's joys with her to share
Yes tell my darling mother I'll be there"
Roy Acuff,The Streamlined Cannonball,"A long steel rail a short cross tie
I'm on my way back home
I'm on the train the king of them all
That Streamlined Cannonball

She moves along like a cannonball
Like a star in its heavenly flight
This lonesome sound of the whistle you love
As she travels through the night

Her headlight gleams out in the night
The firebox flash you see
The blinds I ride, the lights that I love
It's home sweet home to me

She moves along like a cannonball
Like a star in its heavenly flight
This lonesome sound of the whistle you love
As she travels through the night

I can see the smile of the engineer
Although he's old and gray
A contented heart he awaits a call
Of the Streamlined Cannonball

She moves along like a cannonball
Like a star in its heavenly flight
This lonesome sound of the whistle you love
As she travels through the night"
Roy Acuff,Don’t Make Me Go to Bed and I’ll Be Good,"A laughing baby boy one evening in his play
Disturbed the household with his noisy glee
I warned him to be quiet but he soon would disobey
For he would soon forget a word from me

I called him to my side and said, ""Now son, you go to bed
Your conduct has been very very rude.""
With quivering lips and tear-filled eyes he pleaded then with me
""Don't make me go to bed and I'll be good""

Don't, papa, and I'll be good
Don't, papa, and I'll be good
That's what I heard him say and it haunts me night and day
Don't make me go to bed and I'll be good

Our lives have just been brightened by his bright ascending beam
Our boy now in our heart was very dear
I hastened to his bed one night, he was talking in his sleep
He didn't seem to know that we were near

All night and day we watched and prayed we never left his side
To give him up it seemed we never could
It broke my heart to hear him crying just before he died
""Don't make me go to bed and I'll be good""

Don't, papa, and I'll be good
Don't, papa, and I'll be good
That's what I heard him say and it haunts me night and day
Don't make me go to bed and I'll be good"
Roy Acuff,Lonely Mound Of Clay,"[Verse 1]
Beside a new made grave heartbroken
My love for her won't let me go away
And leave her there to sleep forever all alone beneath that lonely mound of clay

[Chorus]
Oh Lord why did you take her from me
Why didn't you take me away
So I could have been there beside her
All alone beneath that lonely mound of clay

Many times I've looked toward heaven and pray she wouldn't be taken away
But this sinner's prayer is never answered so she's sleeping now beneath the clay

[Chorus]
Oh Lord why did you take her from me
Why didn't you take me away
So I could have been there beside her
All alone beneath that lonely mound of clay

I stay here beside you little darling and I promise that I'll never go away
Until my life down here is over then I'll be with you beneath the clay

Oh Lord why did you take her..."
Roy Acuff,Remember Me,"The sweetest songs belong to lovers in the gloaming
The sweetest days are the days that used to be
The saddest words I ever heard were words of parting
When you said sweetheart remember me
Remember me when the candle lights are gleaming
Remember me at the close of a long long day
It would be so sweet when all alone I'm dreaming
Just to know you still remember me

You told me once that you were mine alone forever
And I was yours till the end of eternity
But all our vows are broken now and we will never
Be the same except in memory
[ dobro ]
A brighter face may take my place when we're apart dear
A sweeter smile and a love more bold and free
But in the end fearweather friends may break your heart dear
If they do sweetheart remember me
Remember me when the candle lights...
Just to know you still remember me"

When I lay my burden down
I will give my heart to see her

When I lay my burden down"
Roy Acuff,Pins and Needles (In My Heart),"I know not where on earth to find you I know not how or where to start
I only know I'm here without you I've got pins and needles in my heart

The days and nights are growing longer since first you said that we must part
I only know I can't forget you with these pins and needles in my heart
( guitar )
I always see your face before me your smile is heaven's work of art
But now you're smiling at another and there's pins and needles in my heart
( accordion )
Sometime somewhere we'll meet again dear and love will make the teardrops start
Someday you'll know how long I've waited with these pins and needles in my heart

Roy Acuff,Tennessee Waltz,"I was dancing with my darling to the Tennessee Waltz
When an old friend I happened to see
I introduced him to my loved one and while they were dancing
My friend stole my sweetheart from me

I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz
Only you know how much I have lost
Yes, I lost my little darling the night they were playing
That beautiful Tennessee Waltz

I was dancing with my darling to the Tennessee Waltz
When an old friend I happened to see

Roy Acuff,Were You There When They Crucified My Lord,"Were you there when they crucified my Lord? (Were you there?)
Were you there when they crucified my Lord?
Ohhhh, ohh, sometimes it causes me to tremble (Tremble, tremble, tremble)
Were you there when they crucified my Lord?

Were you there when they nailed Him to the Cross? (To the Cross)
Were you there when they nailed Him to the Cross?
Ohhhh, ohh, sometimes it causes me to tremble (Tremble, tremble, tremble)
Were you there when they nailed Him to the Cross?

Roy Acuff,The Old Age Pension Check,"When our old age pension check comes to our door
We won't have to dread the poor house anymore
Though we're old and thin and gray
Good times will be back to stay
When our old age pension check comes to our door
When her old age pension check comes to her door

Dear old grandma won't be lonesome any more
She'll be waiting at the gate
Every night she'll have a date
When her old age pension check comes to her door

Grow a flowing long white beard and use a cane
'Cause you're in your second childhood, don't complain
Life will just begin at sixty
We'll all feel very frisky
When our old age pension check comes to our door

Powder and paint will be abolished on that day
And hoop skirts will then be brought back into play
Painted cheeks will be the rage
And old maids will tell their age
When their old age pension check comes to their door

All the drug stores will go bankrupt on that day
For cosmetics, they will all be put away
I'll put a flapper on the shelf
Get a grandma for myself
When her old age pension check comes to her door

There's a man that turned this country upside-down
With his old age pension rumor going 'round
If you want in on the fun
Send your dime to Washington
And that old age pension man will be around"
Roy Acuff,"I’ll Forgive You, But I Can’t Forget","You ask me to forgive you, little darling
To forget that our plans were upset
I try oh so hard not to remember
I'll forgive you but I can't forget

Somewhere I hope you are happy
And I hope your heart holds no regrets
Each night I pray the Lord to watch o'er you
I'll forgive you but I can't forget

The sadness of our parting still lingers
My eyes from tears are still wet
I'll always love you forever
I'll forgive you but I can't forget

Now that you've left me for another
What a pity that we ever met
For life's not worth living without you
I'll forgive you but I can't forget"
Bob Wills,New San Antonio Rose,"Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone

It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue, up above
A moonlit path that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love

Moon in all your splendor knows only my heart
Call back my Rose, Rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals fallin' apart
Speak once again of my love, my own

Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone"
Bob Wills,Faded Love,"[Verse 1]
As I look at the letters that you wrote to me
It's you that I am thinking of
As I read the lines that to me were so sweet
I remember our faded love

[Chorus]
I miss you, darling, more and more every day
As Heaven would miss the stars above
With every heartbeat I still think of you
And remember our faded love

[Fiddle Solo]

[Verse 2]
I think of the past and all the pleasures we had
As I watch the mating of the dove
It was in the springtime that you said goodbye
I remember our faded love

[Chorus]
I miss you, darling, more and more every day
As Heaven would miss the stars above
With every heartbeat I still think of you
And remember our faded love

[Outro]
And remember our faded love"
Bob Wills,Stay All Night Stay A Little Longer,"[Verse 1]
You ought to see my blue eyed Sally
She lives a way down on Shinbone Alley
The number on the gate is the number on the door
And the next house over is the grocery store

[Chorus]
Stay all night and stay a little longer
Dance all night and dance a little longer
Pull off your coat, throw it in the corner
I don't see why you don't stay a little longer

[Verse 2]
You can't go home if you're going by the mill
'Cause the bridge washed out at the bottom of the hill
The big creek's up and the little creek's level
I plow my corn with a double shovel

[Chorus]
Stay all night and stay a little longer
Dance all night and dance a little longer
Pull off your coat, throw it in the corner
I don't see why you don't stay a little longer

[Verse 3]
Sitting in the window, singing to my love
The slop bucket fell from the window up above
The mule and the grasshopper, eating ice cream
Mule got sick and they laid him on the beam

[Chorus]
Stay all night and stay a little longer
Dance all night and dance a little longer
Pull off your coat, throw it in the corner
I don't see why you don't stay a little longer

[Verse 4]
Grab your gal and a-pat her on the head
If she don't like biscuits, feed her cornbread
The gals on the big creek about half grown
Jump on a man like a dog on a bone

[Chorus]
Stay all night and stay a little longer
Dance all night and dance a little longer
Pull off your coat, throw it in the corner
I don't see why you don't stay a little longer

[Outro]
Stay all night and stay a little longer
Dance all night and dance a little longer
Pull off your coat, throw it in the corner
I don't see why you don't stay a little longer"
Bob Wills,Milk Cow Blues,"Well, I woke up this mornin' looked outdoor
I can tell my milk cow
I can tell by the way she lows

If you see my milk cow, please, drive her on home
'Cause I ain't had no milk and butter
Since my cow's been gone

Well, you gotta treat me right day by day
Get out your little prayer book
Get down upon your knees and pray

'Cause you're gonna to need me
You're gonna need my help someday
Yeah, you're goin' to be sorry you treated me this way

Sail on, sail on, sail on, little girl, sail on
Sail on, sail on, sail on, little girl, sail on
You're gonna keep right on to sailin' till you lose your happy home

Well, good evenin', don't that sun look good goin' down?
Well, good evenin', don't that sun look good goin' down?
Don't that ol' army cot look lonesome when your lover ain't around?

Now, I tried everythin', baby, to get along with you
Now I'm goin' tell you what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna stop my cryin' and leave you alone

And if you don't think I'm leavin', big momma
Just count the days I'm gone 'cause ain't gonna see
Ain't gonna see my sweet face no more

Yeah, you gonna be wonderin', honey
Where in this world I've gone"
Bob Wills,Take Me Back To Tulsa,"You see that girl with the red dress on
Some folks call her Dinah
Stoled my heart away from me
Way down in Louisiana

Take me back to Tulsa
I'm too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa
I'm too young to marry

Little bee sucks the blossom
And the big bee makes the honey
Dark man throws the cotton
White man makes the money

Take me back to Tulsa
I'm too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa
I'm too young to marry

Walk and talk, Susie
Walk and talk, Susie
Walk and talk, Susie
Walk and talk, Susie

Take me back to Tulsa
I'm too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa
I'm too young to marry

We always wear this great big smile
Never do look sour
Travel all over this country wide
Playing music by the hour

Take me back to Tulsa
I'm too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa
I'm too young to marry

Take me back to Tulsa
I'm too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa
I'm too young to wed thee"
Bob Wills,Roly Poly,"Roly Poly, eatin' corn and taters
Hungry every minute of the day
Roly poly, gnawin' on a bisquit
Long as he can chew it it's ok
He can eat an aple pie
And never bat an eye
He likes everything from soup to hay
Roly Poly, daddy's little fatty
Bet he's gonna be a man someday

Roly Poly, scrambled eggs for breakfast
Bread and jelly 20 times a day
Roly Poly, eats a hearty dinner
It takes lots of strength to run and play
Pulls up weeds and does the chores
Runs both ways to all the stores
He works up an appitite that way
Roly Poly, daddy's little fatty
Bet he's gonna be a man someday"
Bob Wills,Bubbles In My Beer,"Tonight in a bar alone I'm sitting
Apart from the laughter and the cheers
While scenes from the past rise before me
Just watchin' the bubbles in my beer

A vision of someone who loved me
Brings a lone silent tear to my eye
Oh, I know that my life's been a failure
Just watchin' the bubbles in my beer

I'm seeing the road that I've traveled
A road paved with heartaches and tears
And I'm seeing the past that I've wasted
While watchin' the bubbles in my beer

As I think of the heart that I've broken
And all the golden chances that have passed me by
And the dreams that I've made, now are empty
As empty as the bubbles in my beer"
Bob Wills,Miss Molly,"Oh, have you seen Miss Molly
Her cheeks are rosy red
Her lips are soft as satin
And they taste like ginger bread

Oh, Oh, Oh, me, oh, my Miss Molly I'm in love with you
Oh, me, oh, my Miss Molly won't you say you love me too

Now when Miss Molly's smilin'
The sun is dim a spell
And when she laughs
Her voice is like a little silver bell

Oh, Oh, Oh, me, oh, my Miss Molly I'm in love with you
Oh, me, oh, my Miss Molly won't you say you love me too

I'll trade my horse and saddle
Cow drivin' I'll re-sign
If only Miss Molly
Will say that she'll be mine

Oh, Oh, Oh, me, oh, my Miss Molly I'm in love with you
Oh, me, oh, my Miss Molly won't you say you love me too

Now listen dear Miss Molly
I've told you this before
And even though' I told you so
I'll tell you just once more

Oh, Oh, Oh, me, oh, my Miss Molly I'm in love with you
Oh, me, oh, my Miss Molly won't you say you love me too"
Bob Wills,Across The Alley From The Alamo,"[Chorus]
Across the alley from the Alamo
Lived a pinto pony and a Navajo
Who sang a sort of Indian Hideho
To the people passing by

[Verse 1]
The pinto spent his time a swichin' flies
And the Navajo watched the lazy skies
And very rarely did they ever rest their eyes
On the people passing by

[Verse 2]
One day they went a walkin'
Along the railroad track
They were swishin' not lookin'
Toot toot
They never came back

[Chorus]
Across the alley from the Alamo
When the summer sun decides to settle low
A fly sings an Indian Hideho
To the people passing by

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
One day they went a walkin'
Along the railroad track
They were swishin' not lookin'
Toot toot
They never came back

[Chorus]
Across the alley from the Alamo
Lived a pinto pony and a Navajo
Who used to bake frijoles in cornmeal dough
To the people passing by"
Bob Wills,Time Changes Everything,"[Verse 1]
There was a time when I thought of no other
And we sang our own loves refrain
And our hearts beat as one as we had our fun

[Refrain]
But time changes everything

[Verse 2]
And when you left me my poor heart was broken
Our romance seemed all in vain
The dark clouds are gone and there's blue skies again

[Refrain]
Yes time changes everything

[Verse 3]
The time has passed and I have forgotten you
Mother Nature does wonderful things
I guess it is true for me and for you

[Refrain]
'Cause time changes everything

[Verse 4]
Oh you can change the name of an old song
Rearrange it and make it swing
I thought nothing could stop me from loving you

[Refrain]
But time changes everything

[Verse 5]
So good luck to you and may God bless you
I can't say we won't love again
You have gone your way and I'll go mine

[Refrain]
'Cause time changes everything"
Bob Wills,Sugar Moon,"[Chorus]
When it's sugarcane time along around about June
I'll be walking with sugar neath that old sugar moon
Gonna drop her a line to expect me soon
Say I’m craving some sugar neath the old sugar moon

[Verse 1]
I can see her right now she’ll get the calendar down
Scratch a circle around the day we’re altar bound
When it’s sugarcane time long around about June
Wedding bells will be chiming neath the old sugar moon

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
When the sugar moon shines along about June
I'll be walking with sugar neath that old sugar moon
All the kisses I missed I’ll be getting ‘em soon
Sugar kisses from sugar neath that old sugar moon

[Verse 2]
I’m dreaming sweet dreams of all the loving I’ll get
I get back to my pet lordy how I’ll fret
Till it’s sugarcane time long around about June
I’ll be walking with sugar neath that old sugar moon"
Bob Wills,Ida Red,"[Intro]
Now, friends, before there's too much been said
Let's all dance this old tune called ""Ida Red""

[Verse 1]
Light in the parlor, fire in the grate
Clock on the mantle says it's getting late
Curtains on the window, snowy white
The parlor is pleasant on Sunday night

[Chorus]
Ida Red, Ida Red
I'm a plumb fool 'bout Ida Red

[Verse 2]
Lamp on the table, picture on the wall
There's a pretty sofa and that's not all
If I'm not mistaken and I'm sure I'm right
There's somebody else in the parlor tonight

[Chorus]
Ida Red, Ida Red
I'm a plumb fool 'bout Ida Red

[Verse 3]
Chicken in the bread tray, pecking out dough
Granny, will ya dog bite? No, child, no
Hurry up, boys, and don't fool around
Grab your partner and truck on down

[Chorus]
Ida Red, Ida Red
I'm a plumb fool 'bout Ida Red

[Verse 4]
Light's a-burning dim, fire's a-getting low
Somebody says it's time to go
I hear the whisper gentle and light
Don't forget to come next Sunday night

[Chorus]
Ida Red, Ida Red
I'm a plumb fool 'bout Ida Red

[Outro]
Ida"
Bob Wills,That’s What I Like About the South,"Won't you come with me to Alabamy?
Let's go see my dear old Mammy
She's fryin' eggs and boiling hammy
That's what I like about the South

Now there you can make no mistakey
Where those nerves are never shaky
Ought to taste her layer cakey
That's what I like about the South

She's got baked ribs and candied yams
Those sugar-cured Virginia hams
Basement full of those berry jams
An' that's what I like about the South

Hot corn bread, black eyed peas
You can eat as much as you please
'Cause it's never out of season
That's what I like about the South

Ah, don't take one, have two
There's dark brown and chocolate too
Suits me, they must suit you
'Cause that's what I like about the South

Well it's way, way down where the cane grows tall
Down where they say, ""Y'all""
Walk on in with that Southern drawl
'Cause that's what I like about the South

Down where they have those pretty queens
Keep a-dreamin' those dreamy dreams
Well let's sip that absinthe in New Orleans
That's what I like about the South

Here comes that man with all the news
Box back coat with button shoes
All paid up with his union dues
And that's what I like about the South

Now there's a place down south called Dowadiddy
It ain't no jive and it ain't no city
It's awful small, but it sure is pretty
That's Dowadiddy

Here come old Roy down the street
Ho, can't you hear those tappin' feet
He would rather sleep than eat
An' that's what I like about the South

Now every time I pass your door
You act like you don't want me no more
Why don't you shake that head and sigh
And I'll go truckin' right on by

Well, I didn't come here to criticize
I'm not here to sympathize
But don't tell me those no-good lies
That a lyin' gal like you can devise

[Additional verses not in this recording]

If you love me like I love you
Send me fifty P-D-Q
Roses are red and violets are pink
If I don't get all fifty, I don't show

She's got backbones and turnip greens
Ham hocks and butter beans
You, me and New Orleans
An' that's what I like about the South"
Bob Wills,Cotton Eyed Joe,"[Verse 1]
Don't you remember don't you know
Daddy worked a man they called Cotton Eyed Joe
Daddy worked a man they called Cotton Eyed Joe
Had it not been for Cotton Eyed Joe
I'd-a been married a long time ago
I'd-a been married a long time ago

[Verse 2]
Down in the cotton patch down below
Everybody singing the Cotton Eyed Joe
Everybody singing the Cotton Eyed Joe
Had it not been for Cotton Eyed Joe
I'd-a been married a long time ago
I'd-a been married a long time ago

[Verse 3]
I know a gal lives down below
Used to go to see her but I don't no more
Used to go to see her but I don't no more
Had it not been for Cotton Eyed Joe
I'd-a been married a long time ago
I'd-a been married a long time ago

[Verse 4]
I fell down and I stubbed my toe
Called for the doctor Cotton Eyed Joe
Called for the doctor Cotton Eyed Joe
Had it not been for Cotton Eyed Joe
I'd-a been married a long time ago
I'd-a been married a long time ago

[Verse 5]
Hewn my fiddle and rosin my bow
Gonna make music everywhere I go
Gonna play a tune they call Cotton Eyed Joe
Had it not been for Cotton Eyed Joe
I'd-a been married a long time ago
I'd-a been married a long time ago"
Bob Wills,What’s The Matter With The Mill,"[Verse 1]
Took my wheat down to get it ground
The 'mander of the mill said ""The mill broke down""
What's the matter with the mill? (Broke down, broke down)
What's the matter with the mill? (Broke down, broke down)
Can't get no grind, then tell me what's the matter with the mill?

Can't get no grind, then tell me what's the matter with the mill?

But I'll bet that she don't touch much (Oh boy)
What's the matter with the mill? (Broke down, broke down)
What's the matter with the mill? (Broke down, broke down)
Can't get no grind, then tell me what's the matter with the mill?
Not just me

What's the matter with the mill? (Broke down, broke down)

Can't get no grind, then tell me what's the matter with the mill?

[Bridge]
Ah, that's it uncle Bud, play it now
Whittle it down, boy
Yeah

[Verse 5]
Two old maids in a folding bed
One turned over and the other one said
What's the matter with the mill? (Broke down, broke down)
What's the matter with the mill? (Broke down, broke down)
Can't get no grind, then tell me what's the matter with the mill?

[Verse 6]
Makes no difference how you feel
You ought to play that chicken reel
What's the matter with the mill? (Broke down, broke down)
What's the matter with the mill? (Broke down, broke down)
Can't get no grind, then tell me what's the matter with the mill?"
Bob Wills,Maiden’s Prayer,"[Verse 1]
Twilight falls evening shadows find
There 'neath the stars a maiden so fair divine
Moon on high seem to see her there

[Chorus]
In her eyes is a light shining ever so bright
As she whispered a silent prayer

[Verse 2]
Every word revealed an empty broken heart
Broken by fate that holds them so far apart
Lonely there she kneels and tells the stars above

[Chorus]
In her arms he belongs in her prayer is a song
Her unending song of love"
Bob Wills,Lilly Dale,"As I hear the Mocking birds, I remember the words
When you said, that forever you'd love me
Now happiness is gone, memories linger on
From the chains of our love, I set you free

Sweet as the morning, smile like the sunshine
Ours was a love no words could tell
I love you, oh how I miss you
Won't you come back, Lily Dale

Since we have said good bye, I'm so blue, I could cry
Happiness is a thing called the past
Days without you, make my nights, oh, so blue
And always in my heart, our love will last

Sweet as the morning, smile like the sunshine
Ours was a love no words could tell
I love you, oh how I miss you
Won't you come back, Lily Dale
Won't you come back, Lily Dale?"

Bob Wills,Deep Water,"I'm  drifting into deep water
I'm startin' to care for you
You're  getting me in deep water
Be careful what you do

You wanna romance but I'm seeking love
I know I'll regret it when it ends
I'm  winding off in deep water
Why can't we just be friends

It's  restless in this deep water
I'm lost between right and wrong
My  love is true as deep water
Your love won't last this long

Where will it lead me and where will it end
I can't help but wish I only knew
I'm  winding up in deep water
So deep in love with you"
Bob Wills,Stars & Stripes On Iwo Jima,"When the Yanks raised
The Stars and Stripes on Iwo Jima Isle
Thru' the blood and tears they won thru'
Bless the heart of each Yankee
There on Iwo Jima Isle

Resting 'neath a blanket of blue
High on the hill Suribachi flies
Old Glory and she always will

When the Yanks raised
The Stars and Stripes on Iwo Jima Isle
There were tears in their hearts
Tho' they smiled

When the Yanks raised
The Stars and Stripes on Iwo Jima Isle
Ev'ry heart could sing once again
And the sight of Old Glory over Iwo Jima Isle
Swelled the hearts of our fighting men

Long will it wave o'er the hilltop
As a symbol of heroes who died
When the Yanks raised
The Stars and Stripes on Iwo Jim Isle
Each American heart filled with pride"
Bob Wills,Right Or Wrong,"Right or wrong, I'll always love you
Though you're gone, I can't forget
Right or wrong, I'll keep on dreaming
Still I wake with the same old regret

All along I thought, I'd lose you
Still I prayed that you'd be true
In your heart please just remember
Right or wrong, I'm still in love with you

Right or wrong, I'll always love you
Though you're gone, I can't forget
Right or wrong, I'll keep on dreaming
Still I wake with the same old regret

All along I thought, I'd lose you
Still I prayed that you'd be true
In your heart please just remember
Right or wrong, I'm still in love with you, oh oh Lord"
Bob Wills,Sittin’ On Top Of The World,"[Verse 1]
All the summer all of fall
Trying to find my little all in all
Though she's gone I don’t worry

[Refrain]
'Cause I'm sittin’ on top of the world

[Verse 2]
If you see me stealin' don't you tell on me
Just stealin' back to my used to be

I’m going to the station way down in the yard
Gonna catch me a freight train work's done got hard

[Refrain]
'Cause I'm sittin' on top of the world"
Bob Wills,Heart to Heart Talk,"[Verse]
How foolish can you be to be ruled by jealousy?
Could you throw away what we planned?
Why don't you ask your heart, ask it if we should part?
I need to tell my heart exactly where we stand

[Chorus]
So, let's have a heart-to-heart talk
Let's have an arm in arm walk
My darlin', let's try to see eye to eye
And let's have a heart-to-heart talk

[Instrumental Break]

Let's have an arm in arm walk

Bob Wills,Goin’ Away Party,"I'm throwin' a goin' away party
A party for a dream of mine
So put me somewhere off in a corner
With a glass and bottle of your party wine

Don't worry it won't be a loud party
I feel too low to get too high
It's just a sad goin' away party
For a dream I'm telling goodbye

I'm throwin' a goin' away party
A party for a dream of mine
Nobody's coming but a heartache
And some tears will drop in now most anytime

Don't worry it won't be a loud party
Dreams don't make noise when they die
And so since it's a goin' away party

Go away and let me cry
Hey, it's just a sad goin' away party
For a dream I'm tellin' goodbye, goodbye"
Bob Wills,Blues For Dixie,"Oh, if you've ever seen that ole Mississippi
The queen of the delta land
Then you'll understand why I've got the blues for Dixie

If you've ever been to Tennessee when
Those old cotton fields were white in pale moon light
Then you've had the blues for Dixie

If you've seen the glamor of an Alabama moon shinin' in the sky
If you've got a baby in Birmingham
Maybe you'll know the reason why

That I'm gonna be blue till I'm on that choo-choo
Headin' south again, there goes that train
That's leavin' me blue for Dixie"
Porter Wagoner,The Carroll County Accident,"Carroll County's pointed out as kind of square
The biggest thing that happens is the county fair
I guess that's why it seemed like such a big event
What we all call the Carroll County accident

The wreck was on the highway just inside the line
Walter Browning lost his life and for a time
It seemed that Mary Ellen Jones would surely die
But she lived long enough for her to testify

Walter Browning was a happy married man
And he wore a golden wedding ring upon his hand
But it was gone, nobody knew just where it went
He lost it in the Carroll County accident
Mary Ellen testified he flagged her down
Said he was sick and could she drive him into town
No one even doubted what she said was true
'Cause she was well respected in the county too

I went down to see the wreck like all the rest
The bloody seats, the broken glass, the tangled mess
But I found something no one else had ever seen
Behind the dash in Mary's crumpled up machine

A little match box circled by a rubber band
And inside the ring from Walter Browning's hand
It took awhile to figure out just what it meant
The truth about the Carroll County accident

By dark of night I dropped the ring into a well
And took a sacred oath that I would never tell
The truth about the Carroll County accident
Cause the County ordered dad a marble monument

I lost him in the Carroll County accident"
Porter Wagoner,Fallen Leaves,"Fallen leaves that lie scattered on the ground
The birds and flowers that were here now can't be found
All the friends that he once knew are not around
They are scattered like the leaves upon the ground
Some folks drift along through life and never thrill
To the feeling that a good deed brings until
It's too late and they are ready to lie down
There beneath the leaves that scattered on the ground
Lord let my eyes see every need of every man
Make me stop and always lend a helping hand
Then when I'm laid beneath that little grassy mound
There'll be more friends around than leaves upon the ground
To your grave there's no use taking any gold
You cannot use it when it's time for hands to fold
When you leave this earth for a better home someday
The only thing you'll take is what you gave away"
Porter Wagoner,The Cold Hard Facts of Life,"[Verse 1]
I got back in town a day before I'd planned to
I smiled and said ""I'll sure surprise my wife""
I don't think I'll phone, I'll just head on home
For I didn't know the cold hard facts of life

[Verse 2]
I passed a little wine store on the corner
I pictured pink champagne by candlelight
I stopped the car right then, got out and hurried in
My mind not on the cold hard facts of life

[Verse 3]
A stranger stood there laughing by the counter
He said ""I'll take two bottles of your best""
Her husband's out of town and there's a party
He winked, as if to say ""You know the rest""

[Verse 4]
I left the store two steps behind the stranger
From there to my house, his car stayed in sight
But it wasn't 'til he turned into my drive that I learned
I was witnessing the cold hard facts of life

[Verse 5]
I drove around the block 'til I was dizzy
Each time the noise came louder from within
And then I saw our bottle there beside me
And I drank a fifth of courage and walked in

[Verse 6]
Lord, you should've seen their frantic faces
They screamed and cried ""Please put away that knife""
I guess I'll go to hell or I'll rot here in this cell
But who taught who the cold hard facts of life?
Who taught who the cold hard facts of life?"
Porter Wagoner,Dreaming of a Little Cabin,"In dreams of yesterday I wander back to my little cabin door
I strolled beside an old rock garden and saw familiar scenes once more
I heard the organ softly playing its music came so sweet and low
And I heard my mother softly saying as she did so many years ago
(I was dreaming of a litttle cabin when I heard somebody called my name
I looked and saw a sweet old lady I did seem I was a child again
She gently put her arms around me and kissed her little boy once more
And I knew it was the same sweet mother that have kissed me many times before)

I heard her sing the rock of ages and silver threads among the gold
She told me once again of Jesus within a little cabin fold
She opened up a faded Bible where the family record used to be
And I knew it was the same sweet mother that years ago had craded me
(I was dreaming of a litttle cabin..."
Porter Wagoner,I Knew This Day Would Come,"He'd just turned forty-seven when she was only twenty-two
She'd turned his life to heaven from the hell that he'd been through
All her friends said she was crazy she must have lost her mind
She said age makes no difference and it didn't at the time
Through the years she was his comfort oh but anyone could see
That he was growing older and she was growing free
She came in late one morning he said hold me one last time
You don't need to say it's over i've known it all the time
I knew this day would come oh but we sure gave love a whirl
Now the age that made no difference makes all the difference in the world
But i can't hold back the seasons i curse the rising sun
I already know your reasons for i knew this day would come
She said i found a young man he's only half my age
He says age makes no difference it's the heart that sets the stage
The old man listened quietly then he said
You know someday he'll come in late one morning and it'll be your time
To say i knew this day would come i knew this day would come"
Porter Wagoner,A Satisfied Mind,"How many times have you heard someone say
If I had his money I could do things my way
But little they know that is so hard to find one rich man in ten with a satisfied mind
Once I was waiting in fortune and fame
Everything that I dreamed for to get a start in life's game
But suddenly it's happened I lost every dime
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind

Money can't buy back your youth when you're old
Or a friend when you're lonely or a love that's grown cold
The wealthiest person is a pauper at times compared to the man with a satisfied mind
When life has ended my time has run out
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave there's no doubt
But there's one thing for certain when it comes my time
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind"
Porter Wagoner,The Rubber Room,"[Verse 1]
In a buildin' tall
With a stone wall around
There's a rubber room
When a man sees things
And hears sounds that's not there
He's headed for the rubber room

[Verse 2]
Illusions in a twisted mind
To save from self-destruction, hmm
It's the rubber room
Where a man can run into the wall
Till his strength makes him fall and lie still
And wait for help in the rubber room

[Refrain]
From his blurry vision of doom
A psycho in the rubber room

[Verse 2]
The man in the room right next to mine
Screams a woman's name, hits the wall in vain
He's in the rubber room
I hear footsteps poundin' on the floor
God, I hope they don't stop at my door
Hmm, I'm in the rubber room
Now they've come to get me, but they find
I'm a-screamin' pretty words, tryin' to make 'em rhyme
I'm in the rubber room

[Refrain]
Hmm, a psycho
I'm in the rubber room

[Outro]
Doom, doom, doom
Zoom, boom, doom
Zoom, boom, boom
The rubber room
The rubber room
Boom, hmm"
Porter Wagoner,What Would You Do (If Jesus Came to Your House),"(What would you do what would you do if Jesus came to spend some time with you)
If Jesus came to your house to spend a day or two
If he came unexpectedly I wonder what you'd do
When you saw him comin' would you meet him at the door
With arms outstretched and welcome to your heavenly visitor
Or would you need to change some things before you let him in
Like burn some magazines and put the Bible where they'd been
Oh I know that you'd give your nicest room to such an honered guest
And all the food you would serve to him would be the very best
And you'd keep assuring him that you were glad to have him there
That serving him in your home was a joy beyond compare
But what about your family conversation would it keep up its normal pace
And would you find it hard each meal to say a table grace
Would you be glad to have him stay forever on and on
Or would you sigh of great relief when finally he had gone
You know it might be interesting to know the things you'd do
If Jesus came in person to spend some time with you
(What would you do what would you do if Jesus came to spend some time with you)"
Porter Wagoner,Old Log Cabin for Sale,"While strolling along in the country reviewing the scenes new and old
I found an old fashioned log cabin so beautiful there to behold
A stranger was standing in silence his eyes firmly fixed on the door
My heart ached in pity to see him for these were the words that it bore
And the sign it read An Old Log Cabin For Sale an oaken bucket and well
Easy terms just keep a log on the fire and a light burning bright in the dell
Many years an old couple so patiently looked for their boy who's last promise did fail
Now the old rocking chair will be rocking no more there's an old log cabin for sale
( guitar )
A welcome I read on the floormat an old braided rug by the door
The hands of an angel had made it with many a prayer prayed before
In an old rocking chair on she waited for one glimpse of him how she yearned
But now he was standing in silence too late yes too late he'd returned
And the sign it read..."
Porter Wagoner,"Green, Green Grass of Home","The old hometown looks the same as I step down from the train
And there to meet me is my mama and papa
And down the road I look and there runs Mary hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green green grass of home
Yes they'll all come to meet me arms areached smiling sweetly
It's so good to touch the green green grass of home
The old house is still standing though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on
Down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green green grass of home
Then I awake and look around me at these four grey walls that surround me
And I realize that I was only dreaming
For there's a guard and there's that sad old padre arm in arm we'll walk at daybreak
And again I'll touch the green green grass of home
They'll all come to see me in the shade of that old oak tree
As they lay me neath the green green grass of home"
Porter Wagoner,I’ll Go Down Swinging,"The one I love don't want me hanging round
All she does is put me on and put me down
Tonight she's with a stranger at a party in her home
And I'm here at a tavern gettin' stoned
Cause if I gotta go I'll go down swinging
Where there's lights and laughter booze and blonds and a lot of sad sad singing
I'll sober up tomorrow and cry all day I know
At least I'll go down swinging what a swinging way to go
[ el.banjo ]
I dance with all the girls and buy the wine
Play the jukebox till I'm down to my last dime
She thinks she made a fool of me by loving someone else
She should see me make a fool out of myself
Cause if I gotta go..."
Porter Wagoner,When the Silver Eagle Meets the Great Speckled Bird,"We got silver eagles rollin' on the freeways every day
Singing country music, all across the USA
But the wheels one day will fold-up and our wings will take the curves
When the shiny silver eagle, meets the great speckled bird

Then the pearly gates will open and all the angel bands will ring
Standing on that golden stage, we will hear the Great One sing
We'll have a Grand Old Opry, like no one has ever heard
When the shiny silver eagle, meets the great speckled bird

And when Gabriel blows his trumpet, all the bands will be in tune
And when that golden curtain rises, there will be only standing room

We'll entertain the Master, in his Grand Old Opry Church
When the shiny silver eagle, meets the great speckled bird

And when Gabriel blows his trumpet, all the bands will be in tune
And when that golden curtain rises, there will be only-standing room

Yes we'll entertain the Master, in his Grand Old Opry Church
When the shiny silver eagle, meets the great speckled bird
Yes we'll entertain the Master, in his Grand Old Opery Church
When the shiny silver eagle, meets the great speckled bird"
Porter Wagoner,Misery Loves Company,"So break out the bottle bring on the crowd
Just gather round me cause misery loves a company
I've just left my home friends where I couldn't sleep
For missin' a woman that I couldn't keep
She just walked out and left me for somebody else
Now her memory keeps hauntin' me when I'm by myself
So break out the bottle bring on the crowd
Tell funny stories turn the jukebox up loud
Come on sit at my table where the drinks are on me
Just gather round me cause misery loves company

Now I'm not the first one who's lost everything
To a false hearted woman with a false hearted dream
But this is the first time I've suffered myself
Help me get over this love I'll handle the next love all by myself
So break out the bottle..."

Porter Wagoner,What Ain’t To Be Just Might Happen,"I've learned to live my life just a little bit lighter
Gonna look on the lonely days a little bit brighter
My heart's been throwed around it ain't done enough laughin'
What is to be will be what ain't to be just might happen
It don't do no good to worry none
Just turns your hair gray while you're still young
Love can make you sing start your hands a clappin'
What is to be will be what ain't to be just might happen

You can't never tell when love might find you
Could be miles away or right beside you
Some makes you hurt real bad some makes you happy
What is to be will be what ain't to be just might happen
It don't do no good...
( ac.guitar )
I had a love one time sent me out on a ledge
Fourteen stories high standin' on the edge
I don't want that kind no more to start my world a crackin'
What is to be will be what ain't to be just might happen
It don't do no good...
What is to be will be what ain't to be just might happen"
Porter Wagoner,Your Old Love Letters,"Today I burned your old love letters I burned them slowly one by one
Before I'd light the flame I'd read them to try and find the wrongs I done
The first you wrote me was the sweetest the last one broke my heart in two
And all alone I left you weeping for the ashes of your letters tied in blue

As I burned your old love letters I watched my dreams go up in smoke
I lived again those precious mem'ries I heard each tender word you spoke
The first you wrote me was the sweetest the last one said that we were through
Our love is there among the ambers in the ashes of your letters tied in blue"
Porter Wagoner,Howdy Neighbor Howdy,"Howdy neighbor howdy get out and come right in
We'll make a bowl of gravy to sop your biscuits in
Boil a pot of coffee and bake a big fat hen
Cook another country ham to feed a hundred men
Drive your wagon in the yard and turn your donkey loose
Kick that old hound out of the way and watch them fightin' goose
So howdy neighbor howdy come in and sit right down
Come on and tell us all the news how are things in town

We're so glad to see you been a wonderin' how you've been
Everybody's feelin' fine so let the fun begin
Get the banjo off the wall and tune it up in A
Play some good ole country tunes like grandpa used to play

Go and get your fiddle down play the tune that I like so
Somethin' bout an old man Clark I think his name was Joe

Howdy neighbor howdy..."
Porter Wagoner,Daddy Was An Old Time Preacher Man,"Daddy was an old time preacher man
He preached the word of God throughout the land
He praeached so plain a child could understand
Yes daddy was an old time preacher man
He told the people of the need to pray
He talked about God's wrath on Judgement Day
He preached about that great eternity
He breathed hell so hot that you could feel the heat
Daddy was an old time preacher man and Leona would get up to testify
As we'd sing in the sweet by and by then we'd sing I'm on my way to Canaan's Land
Yes daddy was an old time preacher man
Revivals and camps meeting's with four weeks
Folks came from all around to hear him preach
Daddy said if one is saved it's worth it all
But the aisles were all we stilled in altar call
Daddy was an old time preacher man...
Daddy worked for God but asked no pay for he believed that God provides away
We never had a lot but we got by
I guess it's cause the Lord was on my daddy's side
Yes daddy was an old time preacher man
In the sweet by and by we shall meet on that beautiful shore
I'm on my way to Canaan's Land yes daddy was an old time preacher man
In the sweet by and by we shall meet on that beautiful shore
I'm on my way to Canaan's Land yes daddy was an old time preacher man"
Porter Wagoner,Company’s Comin’,"Oh mama I'm excited I'm almost out of breath
What I saw the light that made me run myself to death
I was on the mountain side when I looked down below
And glory be I thought I'd better come and let you know
We got company comin' company comin' we got company comin' up the road
They're down the road about a mile they'll be here in a little while
There's company comin' up the road

Well Granny change your apron and Willie shine your shoes

Porter Wagoner,God’s Wonderful Way,"One Saturday night in a barroom a gospel singer walked in
And bravely she red from the Bible and begged them to turn from the sins
Oh come into Jesus she pleaded he'll be your stalf and your rod
When one of the drinkers said to her (why I don't believe in your God
I don't rightly know how you prove him that pack of lies that you said
If there be a God up in Heaven I dare him to strike me down dead)

The silence that followed was awful the others just stood there in fear
But the drunkard just kept laughin' and sayin' why doesn't your Jesus appear
Then one of the others who stood there said that's enough of that now
What lead you to think that Lord Jesus would bother with you anyhow
Why you're only a bum and a drunker and nothin' that you can say
Would reach up to God in heaven ans make him go out of his way
And then came the voice of a starnger who stood just outside at the door
The stranger who simply was passing by for no one had seen him before
Oh listen to me all you people the place lit up as he smiled
Our Lord marks the fall of a sparrow and every man is his child
There's none so great or so lowly that God's sweet mercy denies
And even the ones who denounce him will never be lost in his eyes
And then he lifted his right hand and smiled up on everyone
And the last words he said were like music I know because I am his son
Now each who was there will remember those words to his very last day
When Jesus appeared in a barroom and told the God's wonderful way"
Porter Wagoner,God Walks These Hills With Me,"We all have treasures we call our own
Mine are these hills I call my home
Just let me live till eternity in these hills
God walks with me
Yes he walks these hills these beautiful hills
Where my soul is always free
What a comfort to know I'm never alone
For God walks these hills with me
Yes God walks these hills with me
Yes he walks these hills"
Porter Wagoner,Daddy and the Wine,"A child walked in a candy store in faded overalls
Put a nickel on the counter said I think I'll spend it all
I've carried it three months or more you can tell it by the shine
Now I need a sack of candy like my daddy needs his wine
Daddy and the wine goes back three years out of my age
In the old days we were happy dad worked hours long and late
Then mama disappeared one day and so did daddy's mind
And now it's me and daddy mostly daddy and the wine
( fiddle )
The child picked up the sack and then he wandered on outside
We put a roll of green among the jelly beens inside
The clerk was broke and so was I we gave him our last dime
A stranger stole his mommy now his daddy's on the wine
Daddy and the wine..."
Porter Wagoner,Little Boy’s Prayer,"Darling I don't know whether you can hear me or not
Because of this lump in my throat I can't talk very loud
But I've got to tell you bout our little son's prayer tonight
If you could've heard it honey you'd've been so proud
I'd already left a note on the table for mom and dad
As if they didn't know what was wrong
Now I asked them to take a care of him now that you and I we're both gone
After I finished the note I figured that he was alseep
So I've slipped in to see him just once more
But he was just startin' to pray and his words froze me at the door
And he said dear God it's late I hope I didn't get you up
But there's somethin' we gotta talk about
You see God my mommy was burried today
And my daddy needs straighten out
Ever since mommy got sick he's been nervous and hollered at me a lot
But that part I can't understand
Cause even a little boy like me knows that worry sometimes overload a man
But God he loved mommy so much
And he used to tel her nothing would ever come between 'em
Now I know that's what's botherin' him now cause somethin' has
And I'm afraid he's thinkin' about joinin' her somehow
God I'm glad that he loved mommy
I want him to be with her again one of these days
But I want to talk to him and tell him that first he's got me to raise
Tell him every now and then a little boy needs a helping hand
And I guess you probably still need your daddy even after you're a fullgrown man
And God if I'd lost him and mommy both it'd be more than I could stand
I know my grandma and grandpa would take care of me
Cause they both love me a whole lot
But God they're older and they don't always understand
The problems a little boy like me has got
Well God I won't bother anymore tonight
But tomorrow night I'll be sure and talk to you again
You take care of my daddy now you hear thank you Amen
I've just stood there thinkin' bout his prayer and all that he said in it
Finally I opened the door and asked him if I could talk to him for a minute
We sat down on the edge of his bed
And both took turns laughin' and cryin' for a while
And he could tell it'd been a change in me
Because for the first time in the long time I saw him smile
So darling you go on ahead but you walk slow
And someday when you'll turn around I'll be there
But it'll be a while cause I'm gonna spend the next few dozen years
Being an answer to our little boys prayer"
Porter Wagoner,I Thought of God,"I walked thru the whispering forrest not a man made sound could I hear
A timie fawn was playing there without a sign of fear
I walked alone up to mountain and looked out over the sea
I saw an eagle spread his wings in flight so gracefully

I knew that I was walking where mortals should not trod and
There on the lonely mountain I stopped and I thought of God
Then I walked through a busy city it was built by men and steel
A young one cries and old one dies where love and hate are real
Then I knew that I was walking where many men had trod and
There in the busy city I stopped and thought,I thought of God"
Porter Wagoner,Committed To Parkview,"There's a man across the hall who sits staring at the floor
He thinks he's Hank Williams hear him singing through the door
There's a girl in 203, who stops by to visit me
And she talks about her songs and the star that she should be
There are lots of special people staying in or passing through
And for one thing or another, committed to Parkview
There's a girl in 307, coming down on thorazine
And a superstar's ex-drummer trying to kick Benzedrine
There's a boy just below me who's the son of some well-known
He was brought in by his mother 'cause his daddy's always gone
There's a bum from down on Broadway and a few quite well to do's
Who have withdrawn from the rat race and committed to Parkview

There's a girl who cries above me, loud enough to wake the dead

They don't know what she has taken that has scrambled up her head
There's a writer and a singer who has tried and tried and tried
They just brought him in this morning an attempted suicide
There are those that never made it, those that did but now are through
Some came of their own good chosing,some committed to Parkview
They wake us about 6:30, just before the morning meal
While they're taking blood pressure, they ask us how we feel
And i always say fantastic there ain't nothing wrong with me
And then they give me my injection and i go right back to sleep
The days are kind of foggy and the nights are dreamy too
But they're taking good care of me, committed to Parkview"
The Oak Ridge Boys,The Lighthouse,"There's a lighthouse on the hillside
That over looks life's sea
And when I'm tossed it sends out a light
That I might see
And the light that shines in darkness now
Will safely lead us o'er
If it wasn't for the Lighthouse
My ship would be no more

Everybody that lives around us
Says tear that Lighthouse down
The big ships they don't sail this way anymore
There's no use of it standing round
Then my mind goes back to that stormy night
When just in time I saw the light
Yes, the light from that old lighthouse
That stands there on the hill

And I thank God for the Lighthouse
I owe my life to Him
For Jesus is the Lighthouse
And from the rocks of sin
He has shown a light around me
That I could clearly see
If it wasn't for the Lighthouse (tell me)
Where would this ship be"
The Oak Ridge Boys,Elvira,"[Intro]

The Oak Ridge Boys,"Thank God, I’m Free","For a long time I've traveled down a long lonely road
My heart was so heavy, in sin I sank low
Then I heard about Jesus, what a wonderful hour
I'm so glad that I found out that He would bring me out
Though His saving power

Thank God I am free, free, free
From this world of sin
Washed in the blood of Jesus, and then born again
Hallelujah I'm saved, saved, saved
By His wonderful grace
I'm so glad that I found out He would bring me out
And show me the way

Like a bird out of prison that's taken it's flight
Like the blind man that God gave back his sight
Like the poor wretched beggar that found fortune and fame
I'm so glad that I found out He could bring me out
Through His Holy Name"
The Oak Ridge Boys,Standing In The Need Of Prayer,"It's me, it's me, it's me, oh Lord
Standing in the need of prayer
It's me, it's me, it's me, oh Lord
Standing in the need of prayer

Not my father, not my mother
But it's me, oh Lord
Standing in the need of prayer

Not my sister, not my brother
But it's me, oh Lord
Standing in the need of prayer

Not the people that are shoutin'
But it's me, oh Lord
Standing in the need of prayer

Not the members I've been doubting
But it's me, oh Lord
Standing in the need of prayer

Not the preacher, not the sinner
But it's me, oh Lord
Standing in the need of prayer

Not the deacon, not the teacher
But it's me, oh Lord
Standing in the need of prayer"
The Oak Ridge Boys,Time Has Made A Change In Me,"Time has made a change since my childhood days
Many of my friends have gone away
Some I never more in this life will see
Time has made a change in me

Time has made a change in the old home place
Time has made a change in each smiling face
And I know my friends can plainly see
That time has made a change in me

In my childhood days I was well and strong
I could climb the hill sides all day long
I am not today what I used to be
'Cause time has made a change in me

When I reach my home in that land somewhere
With my friends who wait to meet me over there
Free from pain and care I'll forever be
Since time has made a change in m"
The Oak Ridge Boys,"Remind Me, Dear Lord","The things that I love
And hold dear to my heart
They're just borrowed
They're not mine at all
Jesus only let me use them
To brighten my life
So remind me, remind me dear Lord

Nothing good have I done
To deserve God's own Son
I'm not worthy of the scars in His hands
Yet he chose the road to Calvary
To die in my stead
Why He loved me I just can't understand

Roll back the curtain of memory now and then
Show me where you brought me from
And where I might have been
But remember I'm human and human's forget
So remind me, remind me dear Lord"
The Oak Ridge Boys,I Should Have Been Crucified,"I was guilty with nothing to say
And they were coming to take me away
When a voice from Heaven was heard that said
""Let him go and take Me instead""

Oh I should have been crucified
And I should have suffered and died
I should have hung on the cross in disgrace
But Jesus, God's Son, took my place

That crowns of thorns, the spear in His side
And the pain, it should have been mine
Those rusty nails were meant for me
Yet Christ took them and let me go free"
The Oak Ridge Boys,Redemption Draweth Nigh,"Years of time have come and gone
Since I first heard it told
How Jesus would come again some day
If back then it seemed so real
Then I just can’t help but feel
How much closer His coming is today

Signs of the times are everywhere
There’s a brand new feeling in the air
Keep your eyes upon the eastern sky
Lift up your head redemption draweth nigh

Wars and strife on every hand
And violence fills our land
Still some people doubt He’ll ever come again
But the Word of God is true
He’ll redeem His chosen few
Don’t lose hope soon Christ Jesus will descend"
The Oak Ridge Boys,I Know What Lies Ahead,"This road I'm on is strait and narrow
But it leads to a better home
It was laid by Christ one day at Calvary
While He suffered all alone
This road may lead over many high mountains
And valleys dark and low
But I'll walk each day with sweet assurance
And I'll safely reach my home

Ahead there's joy and gladness
And rest for the weary soul
Ahead there's peace and contentment
Everybody will be happy and whole
I'll be at home with Jesus
Where tears will never be shed
Though often this road gets rough and rocky
Still I know what lies ahead

While on this road I get so weary
And often my feet would stray
But a gentle hand still leads me onward
And helps me find the way
As I climb each hill and cross each valley
By His hand I'm daily lead
But I won't look back gonna keep on walking
For I know what lies ahead"
The Oak Ridge Boys,After All,"After all this life is over and our burdens have been lifted
And we stand upon the mountain up so tall
Looking over in that city that the Savior is preparing
Gives me faith that I can make it after all

Trials here are sometimes some like many
And at times my feet grow weary
Till it seems I'll almost stumble then and fall
But the tender hand that leads me
Is the hand that keeps me steady
And by faith I know I'll make it after all

By myself I cannot make it
But I know He's there to help me
He will hear my cry if only I will call
Just keep trusting, keep on believing
Are the words I hear Him whisper
Just a few more days to labor after all"
The Oak Ridge Boys,Where Will You Be (A Million Years From Now),"Just one life to live on Earth
And it swiftly passes by
From the moment of our birth
Till the time has come to die
God has given us this choice
To decide our destiny
In a million years where will you be

Where will you be a million years from now
Will you be happy, will you be singing
While ages roll throughout eternity
I ask this question where will you be

In the Bible we are told
Of a day that soon will come
When the people of this Earth
Will be gathered at God's throne
When you stand before His throne
There for all the world to see
Will He say well done
Where will you be"
The Oak Ridge Boys,Beautiful Star Of Bethlehem,"Oh beautiful star of Bethlehem
Shining far through shadows dimmed
Giving the life for those who long have gone
Guiding the wise men on their way
Unto the place where Jesus lay
Oh beautiful star of Bethlehem, shine on

Oh beautiful star the hope of light
Guiding the pilgrims through the night
Over the mountains 'til the break of dawn
Into the land of perfect day
It will give out a lovely ray

Shine upon us until the glory dawn
Give us a lamp to light the way
Unto the land of perfect day
Oh beautiful star of Bethlehem, shine on

Oh beautiful star the hope of grace
For the redeemed the good and the blest
Yonder in glory when the crown is won
Jesus is now the Star divine
Brighter and brighter He will shine
Oh beautiful star of Bethlehem, shine on"
The Oak Ridge Boys,The Old Gospel Ship,"I have good new to bring
And that is why I sing
All my joys with you I'll share
Oh I'm gonna take a trip
In the old gospel ship
And go sailing through the air

Well I'm gonna take a trip
In the old gospel ship
I'm going far beyond the sky
Oh I'm gonna shout and sing
Until all heavens bring
When I'm bidding this world goodbye

Oh I can scarcely wait
I know I'll not be late
For I'll spend my time in prayer
And when my ship comes in
I'll leave this world of sin
And go sailing through the air

Oh if you're ashamed of me
You have no cause to be
For with Christ I am an heir
And if too much fault you find
You're sure to be left behind
When I go sailing through the air"
The Oak Ridge Boys,Jesus Is Coming Soon,"Troublesome times are here, filling men's hearts with fear
Freedom we all hold dear, now is at stake
Humbling your heart to God saves from the chastening rod
Seek the way pilgrims trod, Christians awake!

Jesus is coming soon, morning or night or noon
Many will meet their doom, trumpets will sound
All of the dead shall rise, righteous meet in the sky
Going where no one dies, Heavenward bound!

Troubles will soon be o'er, happy forever more
When we meet on that shore, free from all care
Rising up in the sky, telling this world goodbye
Homeward we then will fly, glory to share

Many will meet their doom, trumpets will sound
All of the dead shall rise, righteous meet in the sky
Going where no one dies, Heavenward bound!

Rising up in the sky, telling this world goodbye
Homeward we then will fly, glory to share"
The Oak Ridge Boys,The Holy Hills Of Heaven Call Me,"The holy hills of Heaven call me
To mansions bright across the sea
Where loved ones wait and crowns are given
And the hills of home keep calling me

This house of flesh is but a prison
Bars of bone hold my soul
But the doors of clay will burst wide open
When the angel sets my spirit free
Then I'll take my flight like a mighty eagle
When the hills of home start calling me

Now I see loved ones over yonder
Tears are gone and their hearts are free
And from that throne my Savior beckons
And the hills of home keep calling me"
The Oak Ridge Boys,In The Shelter Of His Arms,"When my soul was disturbed with sorrow
When My heart was burdened with sin
Jesus opened His arms of mercy
And tenderly took me in

There is peace in the time of trouble
There is peace in the midst of the storm
There is peace though the world be raging
In the shelter of His arms

There are storms that we all encounter
Do not fear they will do you no harm
In the Lord you will find pro tection
In the shelter of His arms

Tho' the world all around be raging
And it's filled with many alarms
Trust in Jesus and He will keep you
In the shelter of His arms

There is peace in the time of trouble
There is peace in the midst of the storm
There is peace though the world be raging
In the shelter of His arms

There is peace in the time of trouble
There is peace in the midst of the storm
There is peace though the world be raging
In the shelter of His arms

In the shelter of His arms"

Up in heaven tonight

Glorious and bright

The Oak Ridge Boys,Come On In (You Did The Best You Could Do),"I dreamed I was dying in Texas
I closed my eyes and I sighed
Like a black and white movie I saw my days
Playing out before my eyes
I was crippled by a life of injustice
I was bent from walking into the wind
I pled guilty on the day of judgment
God just shook my hand and grinned
And He said

Come on in
You did the best that you could do
There's a little bit of right in every wrong
There's a little bit of Me in you

Sister I know that you're weary
You've been slaving in the sun all day
The burden of life in your belly
Sorrow in your heart of clay
Your husband was a man of passion
And passion stole your husband away
And your son gave his life for your freedom
But you feel like a prisoner anyway
Sister

I left my home and my family
Put my shoes in the dust of this land
Found a job and a woman
But nothing went the way I planned
I was ambushed by my own good intentions
Used up every dollar I earned
So I went back to the home of my father
Said your American son has returned
Dad, your American son has returned
He said"
The Oak Ridge Boys,Oh What A Happy Day,"Oh what a happy time that's sure to be
Jesus is a-comin' back to me
I hear Him callin' me away
From this world forever to stay
And when I take my Savior's hand
In that blessed Promised Land
I'll shout and sing through the endless ages
What a happy day

Oh what a happy day
That will be when we gather there
Oh what a happy day
When we climb those golden stairs
We’ll meet with those who’ve gone before
James and John and a million more
What a happy time that's sure to be
Oh what a happy day

And when I walk into Heaven fair meet my blessed savior there
He’ll place a crown upon my head and give me a robe of white to wear
And then I'll walk on streets of gold
And live forever and not grow old
I'll shout and sing through the endless ages
What a happy day"
The Oak Ridge Boys,Y’all Come Back Saloon,"She played tambourine with a silver jingle
And she must have known the words to at least a million tunes
But the one most requested by the man she knew a cowboy
Was the late-night benediction at the y'all come back saloon

In a voice soft and trembling
She'd sing her song to cowboy as a smokey halo circled 'round her raven hair
And all the fallen angels and pinball-playing rounders
Stopped the games that they'd been playing for the losers' evening prayer

Faded love and faded memories how they linger in her mind
Miles and years played the cowboy like an old melody out of tune and out of time

Every night in the shadows thinking back on Amarillo
He'd dream of better days and ask for faded love
Lifting high his glass in honor of the lady and her song
He paid his check then lonely walked the broken cowboy home

Faded love and faded memories how they linger in her mind
Miles and years played the cowboy like an old melody out of tune and out of time
Faded love and faded memories how they linger in her mind
Miles and years played the cowboy like an old melody out of tune and out of time"
The Oak Ridge Boys,Just A Little Talk With Jesus,"I once was lost in sin but Jesus took me in
And then a little light from heaven fill my soul
He bathed my heart in love and He wrote my name above
And just a little talk with Jesus makes me whole

Now let us have a little talk with Jesus
Let us tell Him all about our troubles
He will hear our faintest cry, He will answer by and by
And when you feel a little prayer wheel turnin'
And you will know a little fire is burnin'
Find a little talk with Jesus makes it right

I may have doubts and fears, my eye be filled with tears
But Jesus is a friend who watches day and night
I go to him in prayer, He knows my every care
And just a little talk with my Jesus makes it right

Now let us have a little talk with Jesus
Let us tell Him all about our troubles
He will hear our faintest cry, He will answer by and by
And when you feel a little prayer wheel turnin'
And you will know a little fire is burnin'
You will find a little talk with Jesus makes it right

Now let us have a little talk with Jesus
Let us tell Him all about our troubles
He will hear our faintest cry and He will answer by and by
And when you feel a little prayer wheel turnin'
And you will know a little fire is burnin'
You will find a little talk with Jesus makes it right
Right, right, right"
The Oak Ridge Boys,He Did It All For Me,"Once a man whom we know as the Son of God
Hung upon a cruel tree
He suffered pain as no mortal man
He took my place, He did it all for me

When I step just inside those gates - those gates of pearl
And the master's face I see
I'll gladly kneel at his nail-scarred feet
Oh praise the Lord, He did it all for me

He did it all for me
Each drop of blood was shed for even me
When the savior cried, bowed his head and died
Oh praise the Lord, He did all for me

Oh praise the Lord, He did it all for me"
The Oak Ridge Boys,Sweeter Gets The Journey,"Sweeter gets the journey every day
Serving Jesus really pays
I get happy in this Heavenly way
Cause sweeter gets the journey every day

I don't know about you my friend
I don't know where your journey will end
But as form me and all of mine
We're gonna make that Heavenly climb

Up to  that Heavenly Shore
We'll live forevermore
Never have a trouble
Never have a care
Everything will just be happiness there

Trouble and sorrow used to be my lot
I'd sit and worry bout the things I've not
Now I count all the blessings I've got
And I don't worry bout the things I've not

Some folks seek and never find
Happiness and peace of mind
But I have peace within my heart
Since with the Savior I've made the start"
The Oak Ridge Boys,Didn’t It Rain,"The good Lord went to Noah and he told him about the flood
He said Noah build me a vessel and make it out of gopher wood
Build it big, tall and strong so it won't be torn apart
Old Noah built him a masterpiece and he called it Noah's ark

Didn't it rain children, didn't it rain, rain, rain
Forty days and nights, didn't it rain?
Oh didn't it rain children, didn't it rain, rain, rain
Forty days and nights, didn't it rain?

He had a moose and a goose and a gander
Alligator and a big hippo
A monkey and an ape, a couple of snakes
A ram and a sheep and a goat

He had a possum and a 'coon and a black baboon
Ann eagle and a red-tailed hawk
A buck and a doe, a turkey and a crow
And a donkey trying to bark

He had leopards, lions and tigers
Bulls and a buffalo
Orang-utans and little bitty things
All lined up in a row

He had a dog and a cat and a gopher rat
And a great big grizzly bear
A mule and a cow, a boar and a sow
He had two of everything in there

Didn't it rain children, didn't it rain, rain, rain
Forty days and nights, didn't it rain?
Oh didn't it rain children, didn't it rain, rain, rain
Forty days and nights, didn't it rain?

He had apples, peaches, plums and pears
Grapes and apricots
Bees and beans and turnip greens
He had corn and baby squash

He had a pumpkin and a big watermelon
He had every kind of wheat
And just before he closed that door
He grabbed a handful of mustard seed

Didn't it rain children, didn't it rain, rain, rain
Forty days and nights, didn't it rain?
Oh didn't it rain children, didn't it rain, rain, rain
Forty days and nights, didn't it rain?
Didn't it rain children, didn't it rain, rain, rain
Forty days and nights, didn't it rain?
Oh didn't it rain children, didn't it rain, rain, rain
Forty days and nights, didn't it rain?
Lord, Lord, forty days and nights, didn't it rain?"
The Oak Ridge Boys,I’m Feeling Mighty Fine,"I woke up this morning feeling fine
I woke up with heaven on my mind
I woke up with joy in my soul
Cause I knew my Lord had control
Well I knew I was walkin' in the light
Cause I'd been on my knees in the night
And I prayed till the Lord gave a sign
And now I'm feeling mighty fine

Well I'm feeling mighty fine
I've got Heaven on my mind
Oh don't you know I want to go
Where the milk and honey flow
There's a light that always shines
Down inside this heart of mine
I've got Heaven on my mind
And I'm feeling mighty fine

I've been walking with Jesus all the time
We're walking and talking as we climb
We're traveling a road to the sky
Where I know I'll live when I die
He's been telling me all about that land
And he tells me that everything is grand
And He says that a home will be mine
And now I'm feeling mighty fine"
Brooks & Dunn,Neon Moon,"[Verse 1]
When the sun goes down on my side of town
That lonesome feelin' comes to my door
And the whole world turns
Blue

[Verse 2]
There's a rundown bar 'cross the railroad tracks
I've got a table for two, way in the back
Where I sit alone
And think of losin' you

[Pre-Chorus]
I spend most every night
Beneath the light of a neon moon

[Chorus]
Now if you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams dance
In and out of the beams of a neon moon

[Verse 3]
I think of two young lovers, runnin' wild and free
I close my eyes and sometimes see
You in the shadows
Of this smoke-filled room

[Verse 4]
No tellin' how many tears I've sat here and cried
Or how many lies that I've lied
Tellin' my poor heart
She'll come back someday

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, but I'll be alright
As long as there's light from a neon moon

[Chorus]
Oh, if you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams dance
In and out of the beams of a neon moon

[Verse 5]
The jukebox plays on, drink by drink
And the words of every sad song seem to say what I think
And this hurt inside of me
Ain't never gonna end

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, but I'll be alright
As long as there's light from a neon moon

[Chorus]
Oh, if you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

Come watch your broken dreams dance
In and out of the beams of a neon moon
Oh, watch your broken dreams dance
In and out of the beams of a neon moon"
Brooks & Dunn,Believe,"[Verse 1]
Old man Wrigley lived in that white house
Down the street where I grew up
Mama used to send me over with things
We struck a friendship up
I spent a few long summers
Out on his old porch swing

[Verse 2]
Said he was in the war when in the navy
Lost his wife, lost his baby
Broke down and asked him one time
""How you keep from goin' crazy""
He said, ""I'll see my wife and son in just a little while""
I asked him what he meant, he looked at me and smiled

[Chorus]
Said, ""I raise my hands
Bow my head
I'm findin' more and more truth
In the words written in red
They tell me that there's more to life
Than just what I can see, oh, I believe""

[Verse 3]
A few years later I was off at college
Talkin' to mom on the phone one night
Gettin' all caught up on the gossip
The ins and outs of the small town life
She said, ""Oh, by the way son
Old man Wrigley has died""

[Verse 4]
Later on that night
I laid there thinkin' back
Thought about a couple long-lost summers
I didn't know whether to cry or laugh
If there was ever anybody
Deserved a ticket to the other side
It'd be that sweet old man
Who looked me in the eye

[Chorus]
Said, ""I raise my hands
Bow my head
I'm findin' more and more truth
In the words written in red
They tell me that there's more to life
Than just what I can see...""

[Bridge]
I can't quote the book
The chapter or the verse
You can't tell me it all ends
In a slow ride in a hearse
You know I'm more and more convinced
The longer that I live
Yeah, this can't be... no, this can't be
No, this can't be all there is

[Chorus]
Lord, I raise my hands
Bow my head
Oh, I'm findin' more and more truth
In the words written in red
They tell me that there's more to this
Than just what I can see, I believe

[Outro]
Oh, I...
I believe
I believe
(I believe)
(I believe)
Well, I believe
(I believe)
I believe

Brooks & Dunn,You’re Gonna Miss Me When I’m Gone,"[Verse 1]
I'm still hurtin' from the last time
You walked on this heart of mine
I can't find much to believe in
You let me down so many times

[Pre-Chorus]
Heaven knows how much I love you
But I'm tired of holdin' on

[Chorus]
You'd better kiss me
'Cause you're gonna miss me when I'm gone

[Verse 2]
There's not much chance we're gonna make it
If I'm the only one who's tryin'
You know I'm runnin' out of reasons
We're runnin' out of time

[Pre-Chorus]
Someday, girl, you're gonna wake up
And wonder what went wrong

[Chorus]
You'd better kiss me
'Cause you're gonna miss me when I'm gone

[Verse 3]
You're good at goin' through the motions
And all I hear are alibis
Now I get this empty feelin'
When I look into your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't see a love light shinin'
And I don't know what's goin' on

[Chorus]
You'd better kiss me
'Cause you're gonna miss me when I'm gone

[Chorus]
You'd better kiss me
'Cause you gonna miss me when I'm gone

Brooks & Dunn,Boot Scootin’ Boogie,"[Verse 1]
Out in the country past the city limits sign
Well there's a honky tonk near the county line
The joint starts jumpin' every night when the sun goes down
They got whiskey, women, music, and smoke
It's where all the cowboy folk go to boot scootin' boogie

[Verse 2]
I've got a good job, I work hard for my money
When it's quittin' time I hit the door runnin'
I fire up my pickup truck and let the horses run
I go flyin' down that highway to that hide-a-way
Stuck out in the woods to do the boot scootin' boogie

[Chorus]
Yeah, heel, toe, do-si-do come on baby let's go boot scootin'
Oh Cadillac blackjack, baby meet me outback we're gonna boogie
Oh get down, turn around, go to town, boot scootin' boogie

[Verse 3]
The bartender asks me, says son what'll it be
I want a shot of that redhead yonder lookin' at me
The dance floor's hoppin' and it's hotter than the fourth of July
I see outlaws, inlaws, crooks & straights all out makin' it shake
Doin' the boot scootin' boogie

[Chorus]
Yeah, heel, toe, do-si-do come on baby let's go boot scootin'
Cadillac blackjack, baby meet me outback we're gonna boogie
Oh, get down, turn around, go to town, boot scootin' boogie"
Brooks & Dunn,Red Dirt Road,"[Verse 1]
I was raised off of Rural Route 3
Out past where the blacktop ends
We'd walk to church on Sunday morning
Race barefoot back to the Johnson's fence
That's where I first saw Mary
On that roadside pickin' blackberries
That summer I turned a corner in my soul
Down that red dirt road

[Chorus]
It's where I drank my first beer
It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to Heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on Earth
Ain't just for high achievers
I've learned, I've come to know
There's life at both ends of that red dirt road

[Verse 2]
Her daddy didn't like me much
With my shackled up GTO
I'd sneak out in the middle of the night
Throw rocks at her bedroom window
We'd turn out the headlights
Drive by the moonlight
Talk about what the future might hold
Down that red dirt road

[Chorus]
It's where I drank my first beer
It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to Heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on Earth
Ain't just for high achievers
I've learned, I've come to know
There's life at both ends of that red dirt road

[Bridge]
I went out into the world
And I came back in
I lost Mary
Oh, I got her back again
And driving home tonight
Feels like I've found a long lost friend

[Chorus]
It's where I drank my first beer
It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to Heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on Earth
Ain't just for high achievers
I've learned, I've come to know
There's life at both ends of that red dirt road

[Outro]
Yes, I've learned, I've come to know
There's life at both ends of that red dirt road"
Brooks & Dunn,Only In America,"[Verse 1]
Sun comin' up over New York City
School bus driver in a traffic jam
Starin' at the faces in her rearview mirror
Looking at the promise of the Promised Land
One kid dreams of fame and fortune
One kid helps pay the rent
One could end up goin' to prison
One just might be president

[Chorus]
Only in America
Dreamin' in red, white, and blue
Only in America
Where we dream as big as we want to
We all get a chance
Everybody gets to dance
Only in America

[Verse 2]
Sun goin' down on an LA freeway
Newlyweds in the back of a limousine
A welder's son and a banker's daughter
All they want is everything
She came out here to be an actress
He was the singer in a band
They just might go back to Oklahoma
And talk about the stars they could have been

[Chorus]
Only in America
Dreamin' in red, white, and blue
Only in America
Where we dream as big as we want to
And we all get a chance
Everybody gets to dance
Only in America

[Chorus]
Only in America
Where we dream in red, white, and blue
Only in America
Where we dream as big as we want to
We all get a chance
Everybody gets to dance

Where we dream in red, white, and blue
Yeah, we dream as big as we want to

Brooks & Dunn,My Maria,"[Verse 1]
My Maria
Don't you know I've come a long, long way
I been longin' to see her when she's around
She takes my blues away
Sweet Maria
The sunlight surely hurts my eyes
I'm a lonely dreamer on a highway in the sky

[Chorus]
My Maria (Oh, Marie, I love you girl) (Oh, my Maria)
Maria (Oh, Marie, I love you, girl)
(Maria) I love you

[Verse 2]
My Maria
There were some blue and sorrow times
Just my thoughts about you bring back
My peace of mind
Gypsy lady
You're a miracle work for me
You set my soul free like a ship sailing on the sea

She is the sunlight when the
Skies are grey
She treats me so right, Lady
Take me away

Brooks & Dunn,Lost and Found,"[Verse 1]
I lost her trail on a Friday night
She was gone before I got home
She'd been getting restless
In that big house all alone
I've been up and down these city streets
For three nights in a row
And lord it's hard to find that girl
When she gets the urge to go

[Chorus]
It's kinda like a lost and found
In a border town
Asking bout a diamond ring
They just look at you
Like you've lost your mind
Say they haven't seen a thing
But I know she's been here lately
I can still smell her perfume
And she gets crazy on a full moon

[Verse 2]
And I know she'll be coming back
Her car is waiting right outside
But, I don't want to think about
Who's taking her for a ride
And her unpredictability
Is what I love about her best
Lord I've got to find her quick
Before she does something I regret

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
She's out there somewhere
Burning up the night
Somehow I've got to run her down
I'm running out of time

[Chorus][x2]"
Brooks & Dunn,Neon Moon (2019),"[Verse 1: Kacey Musgraves]
When the sun goes down on my side of town
That lonesome feeling comes to my door
And the whole world turns blue
And there's a rundown bar across the railroad tracks
I got a table for two, way in the back
Where I sit alone and I think of losing you

[Chorus: Kacey Musgraves + Brooks & Dunn]
I spend most every night
Beneath the light of a neon moon

Dance in and out of the beams of a neon moon"
Brooks & Dunn,Brand New Man,"[Chorus]
I saw the light I've been baptized
By the fire in your touch and the flame in your eyes
I'm born to love again
I'm a brand new man

[Verse 1]
Well, the whole town's talkin', 'bout the line I'm walkin'
That leads right to your door
Oh, how I used to roam
I was a rolling stone

[Verse 2]
I used to have a wild side, they say a country-mile-wide
I'd burn those beer joints down
That's all changed now
You turned my life around

[Chorus]
Oh, I saw the light I've been baptized
By the fire in your touch and the flame in your eyes
I'm born to love again
I'm a brand new man

[Verse 3]
I used to love 'em and leave 'em, oh, I'd brag about my freedom
How no one could tie me down
Then I met you
Now my heart beats true

[Verse 4]
Baby you and me together, feels more like forever
Than anything I've ever known
We're right on track
I ain't looking back

[Chorus]
Yeah, I saw the light I've been baptized
By the fire in your touch and the flame in your eyes
I'm born to love again
I'm a brand new man

Brooks & Dunn,Ain’t Nothing ’Bout You,"[Verse 1]
Once I thought that love was something I could never do
Never knew that I could feel this much
But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you
Is more than a reaction to your touch
It's a perfect passion
And I can't get enough

[Chorus]
The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There ain't nothing 'bout you
That don't do something for me
The way you kiss, the way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There ain't nothing 'bout you (Nothing 'bout you)
That don't do something for me

[Verse 2]
In my life I've been hammered by some heavy blows
That never knocked me off my feet
All you gotta do is smile at me and down I go
And baby, it's no mystery
Why I surrender
Girl, you got everything

[Chorus]
The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There ain't nothing 'bout you
That don't do something for me
The way you kiss, the way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There ain't nothing 'bout you (Nothing 'bout you)
That don't do something for me

[Bridge]
I love your attitude, your rose tattoo, your every thought
Your smile, you lips and girl, the list goes on and on and on

[Chorus]
The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There ain't nothing 'bout you (Nothing 'bout you)
That don't do something for me
The way you kiss, the way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There ain't nothing 'bout you
That don't do something for me (Something for me)
The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
Your dance, your drive, you make me feel alive
The way you talk, the way you tease
By now I think you see
There ain't nothing 'bout you (Nothing 'bout you)
That don't do something for me
(Something for me)"
Brooks & Dunn,Cowgirls Don’t Cry,"[Verse 1]
Her Daddy gave her, her first pony
Then taught her to ride
She climbed high in that saddle
Fell I don't know how many times
He taught her a lesson that she learned
Maybe a little too well

[Chorus]
Cowgirls don't cry
Ride, baby, ride
Lessons in life are going to show you in time
Soon enough you're going to know why
It's going to hurt every now and then
If you fall get back on again
Cowgirls don't cry

[Verse 2]
She grew up
She got married
Never was quite right
She wanted a house, a home and babies
He started coming home late at night
She didn't let him see it break her heart
She didn't let him see her fall apart

[Chorus]
Cowgirls don't cry
Ride, baby, ride
Lessons in life are going to show you in time
Soon enough you're going to know why
It's going to hurt every now and then
If you fall get back on again
Cowgirls don't cry

[Verse 3]
Phone rang early one morning
Her momma's voice, she'd been crying
Said it's your daddy, you need to come home
This is it, I think he's dying
She laid the phone down by his head
The last words that he said

[Chorus-Reba McEntire]
Cowgirl don't cry
Ride, baby, ride
Lessons in life show us all in time
Too soon God will let you know why
If you fall get right back on
The good Lord calls everybody home
Cowgirl don't cry"
Brooks & Dunn,Play Something Country,"[Verse 1]
Yes, she blew through the door like TNT
Put her hand on her hip, pointed a finger at me
Said: ""I'm a whiskey drinking, cowboy chasing, helluva time
""I like Kenny, Keith, Alan and Patsy Cline
""I'm a full grown Queen Bee looking for honey
""Ha-ooh-hoo, aw, play something country.""

[Verse 2]
Yeah, the bartender yelled: ""Y'all, it's closing time.""

""Ha-ooh-hoo, now, play something country.""

Brooks & Dunn,Believe (2024),"[Verse 1: Jelly Roll]
Old man Wrigley lived in that white house
Down the street where I grew up
Mama used to send me over with things
We struck a friendship up
I spent a few long summers
Out on his old porch swing
Said he was in the war, went in the navy
Lost his wife, lost his baby
I broke down and asked him one time
I said, ""How you keep from goin' crazy""
He said, ""I'll see my wife and son in just a little while""
I asked him what he meant, he looked at me and smiled

[Chorus: Jelly Roll]
He said, ""I raise my hands
I bow my head
I'm findin' more and more truth
At the words written in red
They tell me that there's more to life
Than just what I can see, oh, I believe""
Oh

[Verse 2: Brooks & Dunn, Jelly Roll]
A few years later I was off at college
Talkin' to Mom on the phone one night (Phone one night)
Gettin' all caught up on the gossip
The ins and outs of the small town life
She said, ""Oh, by the way, son""
Old man Wrigley had died
Later on that night
I laid there thinkin' back
Thought about a couple long-lost summers
I didn't know whether to cry or laugh
If there was ever anybody
Deserved a ticket to the other side (The other side)
It'd be that sweet old man
Who looked me in the eyes

[Chorus: Brooks & Dunn, Jelly Roll]
He said, ""I raise my hands (Raise my hands)
Bow my head (Bow my hand)
I'm findin' more and more truth
In the words written in red
They tell me that there's more to life
Than just what I can see""

[Bridge: Jelly Roll, Brooks & Dunn]
I can't quote the book
Don't know the chapter or the verse
You can't tell me this all ends
In a slow ride in a hearse
You know I'm more and more convinced
The longer that I live
This can't be (No, this can't be), no, this can't be (This can't be)
This can't be all there is

[Chorus: Jelly Roll, Brooks & Dunn, Both]
Oh, I raise my hands (I raise my hands)
Bow my head (Bow my head)
I'm findin' more and more truth (I'm findin' more truth)
In the words written in red (The words written in red)
They tell me that there's more to life (There's more to life)

Brooks & Dunn,Hillbilly Deluxe,"[Verse 1]
Hey, up in the backwoods, down in the holler
Old boys feelin' like a dog on a collar
Keepin' that chain pulled tight
Waitin' on Saturday night
Put on the smell-good, put on Skynyrd
Head into to town like a NASCAR winner
Cruisin' back an' forth to the Tasty-Freeze
Everywhere you look, all you see is

[Chorus]
Hillbilly deluxe, slick pick-up trucks
Big timin' in a small town
Stirrin' it up right about sundown
Black denim and chrome
To the bone with a little homegrown
A country girl cuddled up
Hillbilly deluxe

[Verse 2]
Yeah, couple cute sweet things drivin' a fastback
Shoot 'em a cool smile hopin' that they smile back
""Hey, Baby, what's your name?""
Burn a little rubber when the red lights change
Here come the blue lights, here come Barney
Hide all the beer, y'all, let's move the party
Gotta go, but that's all right
Do it all again next Friday night

[Chorus]
Hillbilly deluxe, slick pick-em-up trucks
Big timin' in a small town
Stirrin' it up right about sundown
Black denim and chrome
To the bone with a little homegrown
A country girl cuddled up

Brooks & Dunn,Hard Workin’ Man,"[Verse 1]
I'm a hard-workin' man
I wear a steel hard hat
I can ride, rope, hammer and paint
Do things with my hands that most men can't
I can't get ahead no matter how hard I try
I'm gettin' really good at barely gettin' by

[Verse 2]
Got everything I own
By the sweat of my brow
From my four-wheel drive to my cowboy boots
I owe it all to my blue-collar roots
Feel like I'm workin' overtime on a runaway train
I've got to bust loose from this ball and chain

[Chorus]
I'm a hard, hard-workin' man
I got it all on the line for a piece of the promised land
And I'm burnin' my candle at both ends
'Bout the only way to keep the fire goin' is to outrun the wind

[Piano & Violin Solo]

[Verse 3]
Come Friday night
I like to party hard
I carry on with the Cadillac cuties
Spend my whole week's pay on some weekend beauty
Come Monday mornin' I'm the first to arrive
I ain't nothin' but business, y'all, from nine to five

[Chorus]
I'm a hard, hard-workin' man

Better than the day she left me
Arm in arm with somebody new
Holdin' hands and laughin' like we used to

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got my best smile on, but it's no disguise
It don't hide the pain in these eyes

[Chorus]
I did her so wrong, for so long
Turned my back on her love, now she's long gone
I did my part to break her heart
She walked out on me and tore my world apart
She used to be mine
Oh, she used to be mine

It's taken every bit of strength that I have
To keep a hurt look off my face
I can't keep from lookin' back over my shoulder
At the lucky man takin' my place

Oh, if it weren't for my pride, I'd probably take off runnin'
Guess what I'm feelin', is what I got comin'

The one thing I thought I'd never lose

Can't sort it out so I'll sit and wonder
Tell myself, ""It hurts, don't it""

I can't believe my eyes, must be a bad dream
You always said we had a good thing
You never once let on we were fallin' apart

Lonesome sound says she ain't comin' back
It's such a cold blow from out of the dark

First time she'd been home in a year or two
Just in time for the rehearsal dinner
That crazy Connie wasn't wearing any shoes

But you can't take the honky tonk
Take the honky tonk out of the girl

Brooks & Dunn,My Next Broken Heart,"[Verse 1]
You picked me up, you shot me down
Steppin' out all over town
Drove me back to drinkin' in this bar
I found myself a brand new friend
I'm headed down that road again
I'm workin' on my next broken heart

[Verse2]
Happy or sad, it's hard to tell
You taught me how to hurt so well
When it comes to love I know my part
Well, I'll play this game that I can't win
I'll be somebody's fool again
Workin' on my next broken heart

[Chorus]
Well, I thought all along you'd be the death of me
But I met one tonight who wants what's left of me

Brooks & Dunn,Indian Summer,"[Verse 1]
The tall weeds lay flat down
On the hard flat Kansas ground
And a sad song in her head
Kept blowin' round

She barely even knew his name
But she liked the way he played the game
Everybody cheered
When he scored that last touchdown...

[Chorus]
Indian Summer
The wonder
The hunger
And the sound of distant thunder
Indian Summer

[Verse 2]
Tangled in a moment of truth
Bottle of wine in a motel room
Blue haze circled 'round
The cold gray moon

While the wind chased the leaves outside
Passion found a place to hide
Late September heat
Couldn't be denied

[Chorus]
Oh Indian Summer
The wonder
The hunger
And the sound of distant thunder
Indian Summer

[Verse 3]
She never even finished school
People like to talk, they can be so cruel
Heard California was a place
To start brand new

So she left that dust bowl town
Sometimes when a long wind howls
I wonder where we'd be
If I never scored that last
Touchdown

[Outro]
Summer
The wonder
The hunger
And the sound of distant thunder
Indian Summer"
Conway Twitty,Tight Fittin’ Jeans,"[Verse 1]
She tried to hide it by the faded denim clothes she wore
But I knew she'd never been inside a bar before
And I felt like a peasant who just had met a queen
And she knew I saw right through her tight fitting jeans

[Verse 2]
I asked her what's a woman like you doing here
I see you're used to champagne but I'll buy you a beer
She said you've got me figured out but I'm not what I seem
And for a dance I'll tell you 'bout these tight fitting jeans

[Verse 3]
She said I married money, I'm used to wearing pearls
But I've always dreamed of being just a good ol' boys' girl
So tonight I left those crystal candle lights to live a dream
And partner, there's a tiger in these tight fitting jeans

[Verse 4]
We danced every dance and Lord the beer that we went through
I'm satisfied I did my best to make her dream come true
As she played out her fantasy before my eyes it seemed
A cowgirl came alive inside those tight fitting jeans

[Verse 5]
In my mind she's still a lady, that's all I'm gonna say
I knew that I'd been broken by the time we parted ways
And I know I held more woman than most eyes have ever seen
That night I knew a lady wearing tight fitting jeans

[Verse 6]
Well now she's back in her world and I'm still stuck in mine
But I know she’ll always remember the time
A cowboy once had a millionaire's dream
And Lord I love that lady wearing tight fitting jeans"
Conway Twitty,Don’t Cry Joni,"[Verse 1: Conway Twitty]
Joni was the girl who lived next door
I've known her I guess ten years or more
Joni wrote me a note one day
And this is what she had to say

[Chorus: Joni Lee]
Jimmy, please say you'll wait for me
I'll grow up someday you'll see
Saving all my kisses just for you
Signed with love, forever true

[Verse 3: Conway Twitty]
Slowly I read her note once more
Then I went over to the house next door
Her teardrops fell like rain that day
When I told Joni what I had to say

[Verse 4: Conway Twitty]
Joni, Joni, please don't cry
You'll forget me by and by
You're just fifteen I'm twenty-two
And Joni I just can't wait for you

[Verse 5: Conway Twitty]
Soon I left our little hometown
Got me a job and tried to settle down
But these words kept haunting my memory
The words that Joni said to me

[Chorus: Joni Lee]
Jimmy, please say you'll wait for me
I'll grow up someday you'll see
Saving all my kisses just for you
Signed with love, forever true

[Verse 6: Conway Twitty]
I packed my clothes and I caught a plane
I had to see Joni I had to explain
How my heart was filled with her memory
And ask my Joni if she'd marry me

[Verse 7: Conway Twitty]
I ran all the way to the house next door
But things weren't like they were before
My teardrops fell like rain that day
When I heard what Joni had to say

[Verse 8: Joni Lee]
Jimmy, Jimmy please don't cry
You'll forget me by and by
It's been five years since you've been gone
Jimmy, I married your best friend John"
Conway Twitty,Happy Birthday Darlin’,"[Verse 1: Conway Twitty, spoken]
Hello, darlin', happy birthday
I've decided not to give you a present this year
In fact I think it's about time
I took some things away

[Verse 2: Conway, spoken]
I'd like to take away the suspicion
That I know clouds your world at times
By giving you some faith to hold onto honey
Whenever your hand is not in mine

[Chorus: Conway, sung]
Happy birthday darlin'
I've no presents, no fancy cake
But I hope I'll make you happy
With everything I take

[Verse 3: Conway, spoken]
I'd like to take away some of your lonely moments
By spending more of mine with you
And I'd like to take away some of those so-so kisses
And replace them with ones that really say ""I love you""

[Verse 4: Conway, spoken]
And I wanna take away the doubt you sometimes have about my love
By showing more...much more that I've shown lately
And then if someone should ask you what I've got you for your birthday
Well you can say, ""Why he didn't give me anything but he sure took a lotta things away""

[Chorus: Conway, sung]
Happy birthday darlin'
I've no presents, no fancy cake
But I hope I'll make you happy
With everything I take
Happy birthday darlin'
I've no presents, no fancy cake
But I hope I'll make you happy
With everything I take

[Tag: Conway, spoken]
Happy birthday darlin'"
Conway Twitty,That’s My Job,"[Verse 1]
I woke up cryin' late at night, when I was very young
I had dreamed my father, had passed away and gone
My world revolved around him, I couldn't lie there anymore
So I made my way down, the mirrored hall, and tapped upon his door

[Chorus]
And I said, ""Daddy, I'm so afraid!
How would I go on, with you gone that way?
Don't wanna cry anymore, so may I stay with you?""
And he said ""That's my job, that's what I do
Everything I do is because of you, to keep you safe with me
That's my job, you see.""

[Verse 2]
Later we barely got along, this teenage boy and he
Most of the fights it seems were over different dreams
We each held for me
He wanted knowledge and learning, I wanted to fly out west
I said ""I could make it out there, if I just had the fare
I got half, will you loan me the rest?""

[Chorus]
And I said, ""Daddy, I'm so afraid
There's no guarantee in the plans I've made
And if I should fail, who will pay my way back home?""
And he said ""That's my job, that's what I do
Everything I do is because of you, to keep you safe with me
That's my job, you see.""

[Bridge]
Every person carves his spot, and fills the hole with life
And I pray someday I might, light as bright as he

[Verse 3]
Woke up early one bright fall day, read the tragic news
After all my travels, I settled down, within a mile or two
I make my livin' with words and rhymes, and all this tragedy
Should go into my head and out instead, as bits of poetry

[Chorus]
But I say, ""Daddy I'm so afraid
How will I go on, with you gone this way
How can I come up, with a song to say, ""I love you.""
""That's my job, that's what I do
Everything I do is because of you, to keep you safe with me
That's my job, you see.""

[Outro]
""Everything I do is because of you, to keep you safe with me."""
Conway Twitty,Hello Darlin’,"[Verse 1]
Hello Darlin', nice to see you, it's been a long time
You're just as lovely as you used to be
How's your new love, are you happy? Hope you're doin' fine
Just to know it means so much to me

[Verse 2]
What's that, Darlin', how am I doin'? I'm doin' alright
Except I can't sleep, I cry all night 'til dawn
What I'm trying to say is I love you and I miss you
And I'm so sorry that I did you wrong

[Verse 3]
Look up, Darlin', let me kiss you just for old times' sake
Let me hold you in my arms one more time
Thank you, Darlin', may God bless you and each step you take
Bring you closer to the things you seek to find

[Verse 4]
Goodbye Darlin', gotta go now, gotta try to find a way
To lose these memories of a love so warm and true
And if you should ever find it in your heart to forgive me
Come back, Darlin', I'll be waitin' for you"
Conway Twitty,Slow Hand,"As the midnight moon was drifting through
The lazy sway of the trees
I saw the look in your eyes looking into the night
Not seeing what you wanted to see

Darling, don't say a word I've already heard
What your body is saying to mine
You're tired of fast moves
You got a slow groove on your mind

You want a man with a slow hand
You want a lover with an easy touch
You want somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush
Baby, believe me I understand
When it comes to love you want a slow hand

--- Instrumental ---

On shadowed ground with no one around
And a blanket of stars in our eyes
Hey, we're drifting free like two lost leaves
On the crazy wind of the night

Darling don't say a word I've already heard
What your body is saying to mine
If you want all night you know it's alright
I've got time

You've got a man with a slow hand
You've got a lover with an easy touch
You've got somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush
Baby, believe me I understand
When it comes to love you want a slow hand

You want a lover with an easy touch
You've got somebody
Who will spend some time with you baby
Not come and go in a heated rush
Baby believe me I understand
When it comes to love you want a slow hand..."
Conway Twitty,It’s Only Make Believe,"People see us everywhere
They think you really care
But myself, I can't deceive
I know it's only make believe

My one and only prayer
Is that someday you'll care
My hopes, my dreams come true
My one and only you

No one will ever know
How much I love you so
My only prayer will be
Someday you'll care for me
But it's only make believe

My hopes, my dreams come true
My life I'd give for you
My heart, a wedding ring
My all, my everything

My heart I can't control
You rule my very soul
My only prayer will be
Someday you'll care for me
But it's only make believe

My one and only prayer
Is that some day you'll care
My hopes, my dreams come true
My one and only you

No one will ever know
How much I love you so
My prayers, my hopes, my schemes
You are my every dream
But it's only make believe (make believe)"
Conway Twitty,I See the Want to in Your Eyes,"[Verse 1]
I see the sparkling little diamond on your hand
It's plain to see that you've already got a man
I can tell you're not about to fall for any of my lies
I see the want to in your eyes

[Verse 2]
Deep in your smile there's a quiet, soft desire
Like the embers of a once raging fire
You know I could light that fire again, you know it isn't wise
I see the want to in your eyes

[Bridge]
How strong's a band of gold
Is it strong enough to hold
When a love has grown cold
And A woman wants a love, sweet and warm

[Verse 3]
How many women just like you have silent schemes?
How many men like me do they sleep with in their dreams?
You can stay or you can go and although I sympathize
I still see the want to in your eyes

[Outro]
I see the want to in your eyes"
Conway Twitty,I’d Love to Lay You Down,"[Verse 1]
There's a lot of ways of saying
What I want to say to you
There's songs and poems and promises
And dreams that might come true

[Verse 2]
But I won't talk of starry skies
Or moonlight on the ground
I'll come right out and tell you
I'd just love to lay you down

[Chorus]
Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things a woman loves to hear
I'll let you know how much it means just having you around
Oh darling how I'd love to lay you down

[Verse 3]
There's so many ways your sweet love's made this house into a home
You've got a way of doing little things that turn me on

[Verse 4]
Like standing in the kitchen in your faded cotton gown
With your hair all up in curlers, I still love to lay you down

[Chorus]
Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things a woman loves to hear
I'll let you know how much it means just having you around
Oh darling how I love to lay you down

[Verse 5]
When a whole lot of Decembers are showing in your face
Your Auburn hair has faded and silver takes its place

[Verse 6]
You'll be just as lovely
And I'll still be around
And if I can I know that
I'd still love to lay you down

[Chorus]
Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things a woman loves to hear
I'll let you know how much it means just having you around
Oh darling how I love to lay you down

[Chorus]
Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things my woman loves to hear
I'll let you know how much it means just having you around
Oh darling how I love to lay you down

[Chorus]
Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things my woman loves to hear
I'll let you know how much it means just having you around
Oh darling how I love to lay you down"
Conway Twitty,Linda on My Mind,"[Chorus]
Now I'm lying here with Linda on my mind
And next to me, my soon-to-be, the one I left behind
And Lord it's killing me to see her cry
She knows I'm lying here beside her with Linda on my mind

[Verse 1]
Yes I know that I once loved her
And I placed no one above her
And I never thought I'd ever set her free
But it just wasn't in my plans
The way that Linda squeezed my hand
The first time that I held her close
As she danced with me

[Verse  2]
She said, ""I've loved you for a long time
But you're married to a friend of mine
And I've tried hard to never let it show
But my love for you is stronger
I can't hide it any longer""
And so I thought I'd better let you know

[Chorus]
Now I'm lying here with Linda on my mind
And next to me, my soon-to-be, the one I left behind
And Lord it's killing me to see her cry
She knows I'm lying here beside her with Linda on my mind"
Conway Twitty,Those Eyes,"God gave some a way of walkin'
Others have the gift of talkin'
They've all got a special way to please

Some men fall for a pretty face
Others go for silk and lace
I bet he knew He'd bring me to my knees
When he gave her

Those eyes, those eyes
Make me do most anything they want me to do
When I look in
Those eyes, those eyes
I know I will never say goodbye when I look into
Those eyes

There's been times I thought of leavin'
Find another place for breathin'
After all I'm just a normal man

I thought by now I would have done it
Somethings always kept me from it
The reason isn't hard to understand when I look in

Those eyes, those eyes
Make me do most anything they want me to do
When I look in
Those eyes, those eyes
I know I will never say goodbye when I look into
Those eyes

Oh, I don't know what you see in me
But you keep on pleasin' me
All my life I've been satisfied just to look in

Those eyes (they turn me around)
Those eyes (they melt me down)
Make me do most anything they want me to do
When I look in
Those eyes (they get to me)
Those eyes (they set me free)
I know I will never say goodbye when I look into
Those eyes..."
Conway Twitty,Goodbye Time,"It's your life, you say you need a change
Don't all the dreams we've seen come true mean anything
You say it's different now and you keep staring at the door
How can you walk away, don't I matter anymore

If being free is worth what you leave behind
And if it's too late for love to change your mind
Then it's goodbye time

If we had known our love would come to this
We could have saved our hearts the hurt of wasted years
Well it's been fun what else can I say
If the feelings gone words won't stop you anyway

If being free is worth what you leave behind
And if it's too late for love to change your mind
Then it's goodbye time"
Conway Twitty,You’ve Never Been This Far Before,"[Verse 1]
I can almost hear the stillness
As it yields to the sound of your heart beating
(Bum bum bum)
And I can almost hear the echo
Of the thoughts that I know you must be thinking
(Bum bum bum)
And I can feel your body tremble
As you wonder what this moment holds in store
(Bum bum bum)
And as I put my arms around you
I can tell you've never been this far before
(Bum bum bum)

[Verse 2]
I don't know what I'm saying
As my trembling fingers touch forbidden places
(Bum bum bum)
I only know I've waited
For so long for the chance that we are taking
(Bum bum bum)
I don't know and I don't care
What made you tell him you don't love him anymore
(Bum bum bum)
And as I taste your tender kisses
I can tell you've never been this far before
(Bum bum bum)

[Bridge]
And as I take the love you're giving
I can feel the tension building in your mind
(Bum bum bum, uh huh huh, bum bum bum)
And you're wondering if tomorrow
I'll still love you like I'm loving you tonight
(Bum bum bum, uh huh huh, bum bum bum)

[Verse 3]
You have no way of knowing
But tonight will only make me love you more
(Mmm mmm mmm)
And I hope that you'll believe me
'Cause I know you've never been this far before
(Bum bum bum, bum bum bum, bum bum bum)"
Conway Twitty,The Rose,"Some say, love, it is a river
And that it drowns the tender reed
And some say, love, it's like a razor
And that it leaves your soul to bleed
Some say, love, it is a hunger
An endless aching need
I say, love, it is a flower
And you, it's only seed

It's the heart afraid of breaking
That never learns to dance
It's the dream afraid of waking
That never takes the chance
It's the one who won't be taken
Who cannot seem to give
And the soul, afraid of dyin'
That never learns to live

When the night has been too lonely
And the road has been too long
And you think that love is only
For the lucky and the strong
Just remember, in the winter
Far beneath the bitter snows
Lies the seed, that with the sun's love
In the spring, becomes the rose"
Conway Twitty,Fifteen Years Ago,"[Verse 1]
I saw a man today who said he'd talked to you
Not so long ago I think a month or two
As my mind raced back in time I prayed
Oh Lord don't let it show
He thinks I forgot you fifteen years ago

[Chorus]
Fifteen years ago and I still feel the same
Why did he have to mention your name
I'm as broken up inside as if it's been a week or so
Takes a mighty strong love to keep a man thinking of a girl
He hasn't seen since fifteen years ago

[Verse 2]
I've got a lovely wife who thinks the world of me
Promised her my love through all eternity
I've tried hard to make her happy
And so far she doesn't know
I can't shake this thing of fifteen years ago

[Chorus]
Fifteen years ago and I still feel the same
Why did he have to mention your name
I'm as broken up inside as if it's been a week or so
Takes a mighty long time to get a real love off your mind
I know, I've tried since fifteen years ago"
Conway Twitty,I Don’t Know a Thing About Love (The Moon Song),"I talked to the man in the moon
I said, ""Sir, is she coming back soon?""
He smiled and he stated, ""Son, I'm over-rated
I've had too much credit in those old love tunes""

I don't know a thing about love
I just kind of hang here above
I just watch from the sky, will love grow or will it die?
I don't know a thing about love

Then I ask him ""Where is she tonight?
You must see all things with your light""
He said, ""Son, I could tell you things that might kill you
But I don't get involved in what's wrong or right""

I don't know a thing about love
I just kind of hang here above
I just watch from the sky, will love grow or will it die?
I don't know a thing about love

He said, ""I can move oceans when I take the notion
Or make mountains tremble and rivers run dry
But in all matters human, remember there's someone
In charge of those things way above you and I""

I don't know a thing about love
I just kind of hang here above
I just watch from the sky, will love grow or will it die?
I don't know a thing about love
I don't know a thing about love"
Conway Twitty,Don’t Take It Away,"I've been looking for you all night long, darling
You got to talk to me
I want to tell you how wrong I've been
And I won't do it again
You know that woman didn't mean a thing to me

I hope I don't embarrass you too much
Here in front of all your friends
I'm gonna get down on my knees
Please let me make it, please I can't give you up
'Cause you've made love so good for me, so long

Don't take it away 'cause love don't come easy
Darling, I'm sorry I stepped over the line
Don't take it away, don't make me go crazy
'Cause I would follow you to the ends of my mind

From now on I'm gonna be the kind
Of man you can lean on
And when the waters of life
Get a little too rough or a little too deep
I'm gonna be your stepping stone
And oh, I remember all those nights
That you used to take right a hold of me
And you'd hold on

Please let me make it, please I can't give you up
'Cause you've made love so good for me so long

Don't take it away, cause love don't come easy
Darling, I'm sorry I stepped over the line
Don't take it away, don't make me go crazy
'Cause I would follow you to the ends of my mind..."
Conway Twitty,The Third Man,"Last night I dreamed
I took a walk
Up Calvary's lonely hill
The things I saw
With my own eyes
Could not have been more real

I saw upon three crosses
Three men in agony;
Two, cried out for mercy
And a third man, He looked at me

And oh, the hurt in this man's eyes
It just broke my heart in two!
And it seemed I could hear him say
""Son, I'm doing this for you.""

I knelt beneath the third man's cross
And slowly bowed my head
I reached out to touch his feet
And it stained my hand's with red

And when I heard him cry in pain
I raised my eyes to see;
The blood spilled from the third man's side
And some of it spilled on me

The third man wore a crown of thorns
Spikes held him to the tree
And I heard him say, ""Oh God, My God
Why hast thou forsaken me?""

And there within the mighty crowd
The ones who mocked Him cried
""King, save Thyself if thou art King!""
And then the third man died

Suddenly, I heard the thunder roll
I saw the lightening pierce the sky
Then third man was still hanging there
And I began to cry

I saw the boulders fall
And heard the breaking of the ground
And then I awoke
And though I dreamed;
I touched my cheek and found

My eyes were wet where I had cried
A dream, I wished I knew
I can still hear the third man say
""I'm doing this for you."".."
Conway Twitty,Baby’s Got Her Blue Jeans On,"Baby's Got Her Blue Jeans On
Conway Twitty

Down on the corner, by the traffic light
Everybody's lookin', as she goes by
They turn their heads and they watch her till she's gone
Lord have mercy, baby's got her blue jeans on

Up by the bus stop, and across the street
Open up their windows, to take a peek
As she goes walkin', rockin' like a rollin stone
Heaven help us, baby's got her blue jeans on

She can't help it if she's made that way
She's not to blame if they look her way
She ain't really tryin' to cause a scene
It just comes naturally
No, the girl can't help it

Well up on main street, by the taxi stand
There's a crowd of people, and a traffic jam
She don't look back, she ain't doin nothin' wrong
Lord have mercy, baby's got her blue jeans on

She can't help it if she's made that way
She's not to blame if they look her way
She ain't really tryin' to cause a scene
It just comes naturally
No, the girl can't help it

Down on the corner, by the traffic light
Everybody's lookin', as she goes by
They turn their heads and they watch her till she's gone
Lord have mercy, baby's got her blue jeans on
Heaven help us, baby's got her blue jeans on"
Conway Twitty,I’m Tired Of Being Something (That Means Nothing to You),"Everybody tells me I'd be better off without you
They say one-sided love affairs tend to leave you lonely, sad, and blue
But, I'm finding it hard to say goodbye to something I hold true
And, I'm tired of being something that means nothing to you

I'd love to see the day you come and tell me I'm the only one you need
You've got me right where you want me, right where I shouldn't be
But, I'm finding it hard to say goodbye to something I hold true
Oh, and I'm tired of being something that means nothing to you

I'm tired of being everything that you don't care anything about
It's just enough to be too much for me to take, and I want out
You're in and out of love with me, not realizing all you put me through
And, I'm tired of being something that means nothing to you

Oh, I'm tired of being something that means nothing to you..."
Conway Twitty,Clinging to a Saving Hand,"Sing me a song of praise and glory
Help this wandering child to understand
That when I close my eyes in sleep eternal
I'll be clinging to a saving hand

I want you to sing to me about the rock of ages
And sing about eternity so sweet
So that when I take my last breath of life
I'll awaken at my saviour's feet

I want you to tell me about Paul and Matthew
And sing about my dear saviour's birth
And tell about his trials and tribulations
While he walked upon his heathen Earth

Come on and sing me a song of praise and glory
Help this wandering child to understand
That when I close my eyes in sleep eternal
I'll be clinging to a saving hand

I'll be clinging to a saving hand..."
Conway Twitty,(Lying Here With) Linda on My Mind,"Now I'm lying here with Linda on my mind
And next to me, my soon to be, the one I left behind
And Lord, it's killing me to see her crying
She knows I'm lying here beside her with Linda on my mind

Yes, I know that I once loved her
And I placed no one above her
And I never thought I'd ever set her free
But it just wasn't in my plan
The way Linda squeezed my hand
The first time that I held her close as she danced with me

She said I've loved you for a long time
But you're married to a friend of mine
And I tried hard to never let it show
But my love for you is stronger
I can't hide it any longer
And so I thought I'd better let you know

Now, I'm lying here with Linda on my mind
And next to me, my soon to be, the one I left behind
And Lord, it's killing me to see her crying
She knows I'm lying here beside her with Linda on my mind..."
Conway Twitty,Who Did They Think He Was,"[Verse 1: Conway Twitty]
A child was born in Tupelo
In 1935
I'm grateful for his music
It forever changed my life

[Verse 2]
Oh I loved *""Love Me Tender""*
And how that boy could sing
But when he died I wondered why
Millions called him king
[Chorus]
Tell me, who did they think
Who did they think he was?
Who did they think
Who did they think he was?
The whole world bowed and prayed
But it only makes me say
Who did they think
Who did they think he was?

[Verse 3]
He was born in Massachusetts
In 1917
The second child of an Irishman
Oh we all loved Kennedy
[Verse 4]
He was brave and strong and handsome
A helluva president
But when he died
Millions cried like he was heaven sent
[Chorus #1]
Tell me, who did they think
Who did they think he was?
Who did they think
Who did they think he was?
The whole world bowed and prayed
But it only makes me say
Who did they think
Who did they think he was?

[Verse 5]

There was a child of Heaven
Born in Bethlehem
Just a simple carpenter
With worn and calloused hands

[Verse 6]
Oh He healed the hearts of many
So they nailed Him to a tree
With no one left to mourn His death
But the women at His feet crying

[Chorus #2]
Who did they think
Who did they think He was?
Who did they think
Who did they think He was?
There was no one left to grieve
But the women at his feet crying
Who did they think
Who did they think He was?

[Tag]
Who did they think
Who did they think He was?"
Conway Twitty,Rest Your Love On Me,"[Verse 1]
Maybe you don't know me any more than I know you
And I wouldn't blame you if you walked away
I've been watching you all evening with those teardrops in your eyes
And it touches me much more than I can say
You know I hate to think that someone could have hurt someone like you
And if I was him I'd be right by your side

[Chorus]
Lay your troubles on my shoulder
Put your worries in my pocket
Rest your love on me a while
Lay your troubles on my shoulder
Put your worries in my pocket
Rest your love on me a while

[Verse 2]
Saw you in the corner from the moment I walked in
Saw your lonely face across the room
No I won't forget you and the way it could have been
Why'd you have to leave so soon
You know I hate to think there's someone you loved instead of me
'Cause at times like this I'd be right by your side

[Chorus]
Lay your troubles on my shoulder
Put your worries in my pocket
Rest your love on me a while
Lay your troubles on my shoulder
Put your worries in my pocket
Rest your love on me a while

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Lay your troubles on my shoulder
Put your worries in my pocket
Rest your love on me a while
Lay your troubles on my shoulder
Put your worries in my pocket
Rest your love on me a while"
Conway Twitty,I Love You More Today,"I want you more than anything in the world
You mean more to me than any other girl
Now he's with you and things you do with him
We've done them for so long
I love you more today, than he can from now on

I've kissed your tears away when you were sad
Held you close, felt your warm love when you were glad
So, no matter how much love he has for you or how long
I love you more today, than he can from now on

We've already done the things he plans to do
So don't be surprised if late at night
I'm in your dreams with you
And if someday his love for goes wrong
I love you more today, than he can from now on

I love you more today, than he can from now on..."
Marty Robbins,Big Iron,"[Verse 1]
To the town of Agua Fria
Rode a stranger one fine day
Hardly spoke to folks around him
Didn't have too much to say
No one dared to ask his business
No one dared to make a slip
The stranger there among them
Had a big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

[Verse 2]
It was early in the morning
When he rode into the town
He came riding from the south side
Slowly looking all around
""He's an outlaw loose and running""
Came the whisper from each lip
""And he's here to do some business
With the big iron on his hip""
Big iron on his hip

[Verse 3]
In this town there lived an outlaw
By the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him
And that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer
Though a youth of twenty-four
And the notches on his pistol
Numbered one and nineteen more
One and nineteen more

[Verse 4]
Now the stranger started talking
Made it plain to folks around
Was an Arizona Ranger
Wouldn't be too long in town
He came here to take an outlaw
Back alive, or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter
He was after Texas Red
After Texas Red

[Verse 5]
Wasn't long before the story
Was relayed to Texas Red
But the outlaw didn't worry
Men that tried before were dead
Twenty men had tried to take him
Twenty men had made a slip
Twenty-one would be the Ranger
With the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

[Verse 6]
The morning passed so quickly
It was time for them to meet
It was twenty past eleven
When they walked out in the street
Folks were watching from the windows
Everybody held their breath
They knew this handsome Ranger
Was about to meet his death
'Bout to meet his death

[Verse 7]
There was forty feet between them
When they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the Ranger
Is still talked about today
Texas Red had not cleared leather
'Fore a bullet fairly ripped
And the Ranger's aim was deadly
With the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

[Verse 8]
It was over in a moment
And the folks had gathered round
There before them lay the body
Of the outlaw on the ground
Oh, he might have went on livin'
But he made one fatal slip
When he tried to match the Ranger
With the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

[Outro]
Big iron, big iron
When he tried to match the Ranger
With the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip"
Marty Robbins,El Paso,"[Verse 1]
Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Nighttime would find me in Rosa's Cantina
Music would play and Feleena would whirl

[Verse 2]
Blacker than night were the eyes of Feleena
Wicked and evil while casting her spell
My love was deep for this Mexican maiden
I was in love, but in vain, I could tell

[Chorus 1]
One night, a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing
With wicked Feleena, the girl that I love

[Verse 3]
So in anger, I challenged his right for the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore
My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor
[Full-Length Version - Verse 4]
Just for a moment, I stood there in silence
Shocked by the foul, evil deed I had done
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there
I had but one chance, and that was to run

[Chorus 2]
Out through the back door of Rosa's, I ran
Out where the horses were tied
I caught a good one, it looked like it could run
Up on its back, and away I did ride

[Post-Chorus]
Just as fast as I could
From the West Texas town of El Paso
Out to the badlands of New Mexico

[Verse 5]
Back in El Paso my life would be worthless
Everything's gone in life, nothing is left
It's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than my fear of death

[Chorus 3]
I saddled up, and away I did go
Riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me
Tonight, nothing's worse than this pain in my heart

[Verse 6]
And at last, here I am on the hill overlooking El Paso
I can see Rosa's Cantina below
My love is strong and it pushes me onward
Down off the hill to Feleena, I go

[Verse 7]
Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys
Off to my left ride a dozen or more
Shouting and shooting, I can't let them catch me
I have to make it to Rosa's back door

[Chorus 4]
Something is dreadfully wrong, for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side
Though I am trying to stay in the saddle
I'm getting weary, unable to ride

[Verse 8]
But my love for Feleena is strong, and I rise where I've fallen
Though I am weary, I can't stop to rest
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest

[Outro]
From out of nowhere, Feleena has found me
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for
One little kiss, and Feleena, goodbye"
Marty Robbins,Cool Water,"[Verse 1]
All day I've faced a barren waste
Without the taste of water
Cool water
Old Dan and I with throats burned dry
And souls that cry for water
Cool, clear water

[Verse 2]
The nights are cool and I'm a fool
Each star's a pool of water
Cool water
And with the dawn I'll wake and yawn
And carry on to water
Cool, clear water

[Chorus]
Keep a-movin, Dan, dontcha listen to him, Dan
He's a devil, not a man
And he spreads the burning sand with water
Dan, can ya see that big, green tree?
Where the water's runnin' free
And it's waiting there for you and me?
Water
Cool, clear water

[Verse 3]
The shadows sway and seem to say
Tonight we pray for water
Cool water
And way up there He'll hear our prayer
And show us where there's water
Cool, clear water

[Chorus]
Keep a-movin, Dan, dontcha listen to him, Dan
He's a devil, not a man
And he spreads the burning sand with water
Dan, can ya see that big, green tree?
Where the water's runnin' free
And it's waitin' there for you and me?
Water
Cool, clear water
Cool, clear water"
Marty Robbins,Faleena (From El Paso),"[Verse 1]
Out in New Mexico, many long years ago
There in a shack on the desert, one night in a storm
Amid streaks of lightnin' and loud desert thunder
To a young Mexican couple, a baby was born
Just as the baby cried, thunder and lightnin' died
Moon gave it's light to the world and the stars did the same
Mother and Father, both proud of the daughter
That heaven had sent them, Faleena was this baby's name

[Verse 2]
When she was seventeen, bothered by crazy dreams
She ran away from the shack and left them to roam
Father and Mother, both asked one another
What made her run away, what made Faleena leave home?
Tired of the desert nights, poverty, grief and strife
She ran away late one night in the moon's golden gleam
She didn't know where she'd go, but she'd get there
And she would find happiness, if she would follow her dream

[Verse 3]
After she ran away, she went to Sante Fe
And in the year that she stayed there, she learned about life
In just a little while, she learned that with a smile
She could have pretty clothes, she could be any man's wife
Rich men romanced her, they dined and they danced her
She understood men and she treated them all just the same
A form that was fine and rare, dark shining glossy hair
Lovely to look at; Faleena was this woman's name

[Verse 4]
Restless in Sante Fe, she had to get away
To any town where the lights had a much brighter glow
One cowboy mentioned the town of El Paso
They never stopped dancin' and money like whiskey did flow
She bought a one-way, a ticket from Sante Fe
Three days and nights on a stage with a rest now and then
She didn't mind that, she knew she would find that
Her new life would be more exciting than where she had been

[Verse 5]
The stage made it's last stop, up there on the mountain top
To let her see all of the lights at the foot of the hill
Her world was brighter and deep down inside her
An uncontrolled beating, her young heart just wouldn't be still
She got a hotel, a room at the Lily Belle
Quickly she changed to a form-fitting black satin dress
Ev'ry man stopped to stare, at this form fine and rare
Even the women remarked of the charm she possessed

[Verse 6]
Dancin' and laughter, was what she was after
And Rosa's Cantina had lights, with love in the gleam
That's what she hunted and that's what she wanted
Rosa's was one place, a nice girl would never be seen
It was the same way, it was back in Sante Fe
Men would make fools of themselves at the thought of romance
Rosa took heed of, the place was in need of
This kind of excitement, so she paid Faleena to dance

[Verse 7]
A year passed and maybe more and then through the swingin' doors
Came a young cowboy so tall and so handsomely dressed
This one was new in town, hadn't been seen around
He was so different, he wasn't like all of the rest
Faleena danced close to him, then threw a rose to him
Quickly he walked to her table and there he sat down
And in a day or so, wherever folks would go
They'd see this young cowboy, showin' Faleena the town

[Verse 8]
Six weeks he went with her, each minute spent with her
But he was insanely jealous of glances she'd give
Inside he was a-hurtin', from all of her flirtin'
That was her nature and that was the way that she lived
She flirted one night, it started a gun-fight
And after the smoke cleared away, on the floor lay a man
Faleena's young lover had shot down another
And he had to leave there, so out through the back door he ran

[Verse 9]
The next day at five o'clock, she heard a rifle shot
Quickly she ran to the door, that was facin' the pass
She saw her cowboy, her wild-ridin' cowboy
Low in the saddle, her cowboy was ridin' in fast
She ran to meet him, to kiss and to greet him
He saw her and motioned her back, with a wave of his hand
Bullets were flyin', Faleena was cryin'
As she saw him fall from the saddle and into the sand

[Verse 10]
Faleena knelt near him, to hold and to hear him
When she felt the warm blood that flowed from the wound in his side
He raised to kiss her and she heard him whisper
""Never forget me - Faleena it's over, goodbye.""
Quickly she grabbed for, the six-gun that he wore
And screamin' in anger and placin' the gun to her breast
Bury us both deep and maybe we'll find peace
And pullin' the trigger, she fell 'cross the dead cowboy's chest

[Verse 11]
Out in El Paso, whenever the wind blows
If you listen closely at night, you'll hear in the wind
A woman is cryin', it's not the wind sighin'
Old timers tell you Faleena is callin' for him
You'll hear them talkin' and you'll hear them walkin'
You'll hear them laugh and you'll look, but there's no one around
Don't be alarmed - there is really no harm there
It's only the young cowboy, showin' Faleena the town"
Marty Robbins,Ain’t I Right,"[Verse 1]
You came down to this Southern town last summer
To show the folks a brand new way of life
But all you've shown the folks around here is trouble
And you've only added misery to their strife
Your concern is not to help the people
And I'll say again, though it's been often said
Your concern is just to bring discomfort, my friend
And your policy is just a little red

[Refrain]
Now, ain't I right (Ain't he right?)
(Ain't he right?)

[Verse 2]
It matters not to you how people suffer
And should they, you'd consider that a gain
You bring a lot of trouble to the town and then you leave
That's part of your Communistic game
I detect a little Communism
I can see it in the things you do
Communism, socialism, call it what you like
There's very little difference in the two

[Refrain]
Now, ain't I right (Ain't he right?)
(Ain't he right?)

[Verse 3]
Your followers sometimes have been a bearded, bathless bunch
There's even been a minister or two
A priest, a nun, a rabbi and an educated man
Have listened and been taken in by you
Ah, the country's full of two-faced politicians
Who encourage you with words that go like this
Burn your draft card if you like, it's good to disagree
That's a get acquainted Communistic kiss

[Refrain]
Now, ain't I right (Ain't he right?)
(Ain't he right?)

[Verse 4]
One politician said it would be nice to send some blood
And help the enemy in Vietnam
That's what he says, here's what I say
Let's just keep the blood
Instead let's send that politician man
Let's rid the country of the politicians
Who coddle tramps that march out in our streets
Protesting those who wanna fight for freedom, my friend
This kind of leader makes our country weak

[Refrain]
Now, ain't I right (Ain't he right?)
(Ain't he right?)

[Verse 5]
Let's look and find the strong and able leaders
It's time we found just how our neighbors stand
If we're to win this war with Communism
Let's fight it here as well as Vietnam
Let's rise as one and meet our obligations
So Communistic boots will never trod
Across the fields of freedom that were given to us
With the blessing of our great almighty God

[Outro]
Across the fields of freedom that were given to us
With the blessing of our great almighty God"
Marty Robbins,They’re Hanging Me Tonight,"[Verse 1]
When I hear the rain a-comin' down
It makes me sad and blue
Was on a rainy night like this
That Flo said we were through

[Verse 2]
I told her how I loved her and
I begged her not to go
But another man had changed her mind
So I said goodbye to Flo

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Alone within my cell tonight
My heart is filled with fear
The only sound within the room
Is the falling of each tear

[Chorus]
I think about the thing I've done
I know it wasn't right
They'll bury Flo tomorrow
But they're hanging me tonight
They're hanging me tonight

[Verse 3]
That night he came and took my Flo
And headed into town
I knew I had to find this man
And try to gun him down

[Verse 4]
As I walked by a dim café
And I looked through the door
I saw my Flo with her new love
And I couldn't stand no more
I couldn't stand no more

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I took my pistol from my hip
And with a trembling hand
I took the life of pretty Flo
And that good for nothin' man
That good for nothin' man

[Chorus]
I think about the thing I've done
I know it wasn't right
They'll bury Flo tomorrow
But they're hanging me tonight
They're hanging me tonight"
Marty Robbins,The Master’s Call,"When I was but a young man I was wild and full of fire
A youth within my teens, but full of challenge and desire
I ran away from home and left my mother and my dad
I know it grieved them so to think their only boy was bad

I fell in with an outlaw band, their names were known quite well
How many times we robbed and plundered, I could never tell
This kind of sinful living leads only to a fall
I learned that much and more the night I heard my Master call

One night we rustled cattle, a thousand head or so
And started them out on the trail that leads to Mexico
But a norther started blowing and lightning flashed about
I thought someone was calling me, I thought I heard a shout
Then at that moment lightning struck not twenty yards from me
And left there was a giant cross where once there was a tree
And this time I knew I heard a voice, a voice so sweet and strange
A voice that came from everywhere, a voice that called my name

So frightened I was thinking of sinful deeds I'd done
I failed to see the thousand head of cattle start to run
The cattle they stampeded, were running all around
My pony ran but stumbled and it threw me to the ground

I felt the end was near, that death would be the price
When a mighty bolt of lightning showed the face of Jesus Christ
And I cried oh Lord forgive me, don't let it happen now
I want to live for you alone, Oh God these words I vow

My wicked past unfolded, I thought of wasted years
When another bolt of lightning killed a hundred head of steers
And the others rushed on by me and I was left to live
The Master had a reason, life is his to take or give

A miracle performed that night, I wasn't meant to die
The dead ones formed a barricade least six or seven high
And right behind it there was I, afraid but safe and sound
I cried and begged for mercy kneeling there upon the ground

A pardon I was granted, my sinful soul set free
No more to fear the angry waves upon life's stormy sea
Forgiven by the love of God, a love that will remain
I gave my life and soul the night the Saviour called my name..."
Marty Robbins,Devil Woman,"[Verse 1]
I told Mary about us
I told her about our great sin
Mary cried and forgave me
And Mary took me back again
Said if I wanted my freedom
I could be free evermore
But I don't want to be, and I don't want to see
Mary crying anymore

[Chorus]
Oh, devil woman
Devil woman, let go of me
Devil woman, let me be
And leave me alone
I want to go home

[Verse 2]
Mary is waitin' and weepin'
Down in our shack by the sea
Even after I've hurt her
Mary' still in love with me
Devil woman it's over
Trapped no more by your charms
Cause I don't want to stay, I want to get away
Woman let go of my arm

[Chorus]
Oh, devil woman
Devil woman, let go of me
Devil woman, let me be
And leave me alone
I want to go home

[Verse 3]
Devil woman you're evil
Like the dark coral reef
Like the winds that bring high tides
You bring sorrow and grief
You made me ashamed to face Mary
Barely had the strength to tell
Skies are not so black, Mary took me back
Mary has broken your spell

[Chorus]
Oh, devil woman
Devil woman, let go of me
Devil woman, let me be
And leave me alone
I want to go home

[Verse 4]
Runnin' along by the seashore
Runnin' as fast as I can
Even the seagulls are happy
Glad I'm coming home again
Never again will I ever
Cause another tear to fall
Down the beach I see, what belongs to me
The one I want most of all

[Outro]
Oh, devil woman, devil woman
Don't follow me
Devil woman, let me be
And leave me alone
I'm going back home"
Marty Robbins,Ballad of the Alamo,"In the southern part of Texas
In the town of San Antone
There's a fortress all in ruins
That the weeds have overgrown
You may look in vain for crosses
And you'll never see a one
But sometimes between the setting
And the rising of the sun
You can hear a ghostly bugle
As the men go marchin' by
You can hear them as they answer
To that roll call in the sky
Colonel Travis, Davy Crockett
And a hundred eighty more
Captain Dickinson, Jim Bowie
Present and accounted for
Back in 1836, Houston said to Travis
""Get some volunteers and go
Fortify the Alamo""
Well the men came from Texas
And from old Tennessee
And they joined up with Travis
Just to fight for the right to be free

Indian scouts with squirrel guns
Men with muzzle-loaders
Stood together, heel and toe
To defend the Alamo

""You may never see your loved ones""
Travis told them that day
""Those who want to can leave now
Those who fight to the death let 'em stay""

In the sand he drew the line
With his army sabre
Out of a hundred eighty five
Not a soldier crossed the line

With his banners a-dancin'
In the dawn's golden light
Santa Anna came prancin'
On a horse that was black as the night

Sent an officer to tell
Travis to surrender
Travis answered with a shell
And a rousin' rebel yell

Santa Anna turned scarlet
""Play degüello!"" he roared
""I will show them no quarter
Everyone will be put to the sword!""

One hundred and eighty five
Holdin' back five thousand
Five days, six days, eight days, ten
Travis held and held again

Then he sent for replacements
For his wounded and lame
But the troops that were comin'
Never came, never came, never came
Twice he charged then blew recall
On the fatal third time
Santa Anna breached the wall
And he killed them, one and all

Now the bugles are silent
And there's rust on each sword
And the small band of soldiers
Lie asleep in the arms of the Lord

In the southern part of Texas
Near the town of San Antone
Like a statue on his pinto
Rides a cowboy all alone

And he sees the cattle grazin'
Where a century before
Santa Anna's guns were blazin'
And the cannons used to roar
And his eyes turn sorta misty
And his heart begins to glow
And he takes his hat off slowly
To the men of Alamo

To the thirteen days of glory
At the siege of Alamo"
Marty Robbins,The Strawberry Roan,"I was hangin' 'round town, just spendin' my time
Out of a job, not earnin' a dime
A feller steps up and he said, ""I suppose
You're a bronc fighter from looks of your clothes.""
""You figures me right, I'm a good one."" I claim
""Do you happen to have any bad ones to tame?""
Said ""He's got one, a bad one to buck
At throwin' good riders, he's had lots of luck.""

I gets all het up and I ask what he pays
To ride this old nag for a couple of days
He offered me ten; I said, ""I'm your man
A bronc never lived that I couldn't span.""
He said: ""Get your saddle, I'll give you a chance""
In his buckboard we hopped and he drives to the ranch
I stayed 'til mornin' and right after chuck
I stepped out to see if this outlaw can buck
Down in the horse corral standin' alone
Is an old Caballo, a Strawberry Roan
His legs are all spavined, he's got pigeon toes
Little pig eyes and a big Roman nose
Little pin ears that touched at the tip
A big 44 brand was on his left hip
U-necked and old, with a long, lower jaw
I could see with one eye, he's a regular outlaw

I gets the blinds on 'im and it sure is a fright
Next comes the saddle and I screws it down tight
Then I steps on 'im and I raises the blinds
Get outta the way boys, he's gonna unwind
He sure is a frog-walker, he heaves a big sigh
He only lacks wings, for to be on the fly
He turns his old belly right up to the sun
He sure is a sun-fishin', son-of-a-gun

He's about the worst bucker I've seen on the range
He'll turn on a Nickel and give you some change
He hits on all fours and goes up on high
Leaves me a spinnin' up there in the sky
I turns over twice and I comes back to earth
I lights in a cussin' the day of his birth
I know there are ponies that I cannot ride
There's some of them left, they haven't all died
I'll bet all my money, the man ain't alive
That'll stay with Old Strawberry
When he makes his high dive"
Marty Robbins,El Paso City,"[Verse 1]
From thirty thousand feet above
The desert floor, I see it there below
A city with a legend
The west Texas city of El Paso
Where long ago I heard a song
About a Texas cowboy and a girl
And a little place called Rosa's
Where he used to go and watch this beauty whirl
I don't recall who sang the song
But I recall the story that I heard
And as I look down on the city
I remember each and every word
The singer sang about a jealous cowboy
And the way he used a gun
To kill another cowboy
Then he had to leave El Paso on the run

[Hook 1]
El Paso City, by the Rio Grande
The cowboy lived and rode away
But love was strong, he couldn't stay
He rode back just to die in that El Paso sand

El Paso City, by the Rio Grande
I try not to let you cross my mind
But still I find there's such a mystery in the song
That I don't understand

[Verse 2]
My mind is down there somewhere
As I fly above the badlands of New Mexico
I can't explain why I should know
The very trail he rode back to El Paso
Can it be that man can disappear from life and live another time?
And does the mystery deepen
Cause you think that you yourself lived in that other time?

Somewhere in my deepest thoughts
Familiar scenes and memories unfold
These wild and unexplained emotions that I've had so long
But I have never told
Like every time I fly up through the heavens
And I see you there below
I get the feeling sometime in another world I lived in El Paso

[Hook 2]
El Paso City, by the Rio Grande
Could it be, that I could be
The cowboy in this mystery
That died there in that desert sand so long ago?

El Paso City, by the Rio Grande
A voice tells me to go and see
Another voice, keeps tellin' me
Maybe death awaits me in El Paso

El Paso City....."
Marty Robbins,Mr. Shorty,"Nobody knew where he came from
They only knew he came in
Slowly he walked to the end of the bar
And he ordered up one slug of gin

Well, I could see that he wasn't a large man
I could tell that he wasn't too tall
I judged him to be 'bout five-foot three
And his voice was a soft Texas drawl

Said he was needin' some wages
'Fore he could ride for the west
Said he could do most all kind of work
Said he could ride with the best

There in his blue eyes was sadness
That comes from the need of a friend
And tho' he tried, he still couldn't hide
The loneliness there, deep within

Said he would work thru the winter
For thirty a month and his board
I started to say where he might land a job
When a fellow came in thru the door

And I could tell he was lookin' for trouble
From the way that he came stompin' in
He told me to leave Shorty there by himself
Come down and wait on a man

The eyes of the little man narrowed
The smile disappeared from his face
Gone was the friendliness that I had seen
And a wild look of hate took its' place

But the big one continued to mock him
And he told me that I'd better go
Find him a couple of glasses of milk
Then maybe Shorty would grow

When the little man spoke, there was stillness
He made sure that everyone heard
Slowly he stepped away from the bar
And I still remember these words

Oh! it's plain that you're lookin' for trouble
Trouble's what I try to shun
If that's what you want, then that's what you'll get
Cause cowboy, we're both packin' guns

His hand was already positioned
Feet wide apart on the floor
I hadn't noticed but there on his hip
Was a short-barreled Bass Forty-Four

It was plain he was ready and waitin'
He leaned a bit forward and said
When you call me Shorty, say Mister, my friend
Maybe you'd rather be dead

In the room was a terrible silence
As the big one stepped out on the floor
All drinkin' stopped and the tick of the clock
Said death would wait ten seconds more

He cursed once or twice in a whisper
And he said with a snarl on his lips
Nobody's Mister to me, little man!
And he grabbed for the gun on his hips

But the little man's hands was like lightning
The Bass Forty-Four was the same
The Forty-Four spoke and it sent lead and smoke
And seventeen inches of flame

For the big one had never cleared leather
Beaten before he could start
A little round hole had appeared on his shirt
The bullet went clear thru his heart

The little man stood there a moment
Then holstered the Bass Forty-Four
It's always this way so I never stay
Slowly he walked out the door

Nobody knew where he came from
They won't forget he came by
They won't forget how a Forty-Four gun
One night made the difference in size

As for me, I'll remember the sadness
Shown in the eyes of the man
If we meet someday, you can bet I would say
That it's me, Mr. Shorty, your friend"
Marty Robbins,A Hundred and Sixty Acres,"I got a hundred and sixty acres in the valley
Got a hundred and sixty acres of the best
Got an old stove there that'll cook three square
And a bunk where I can lay me down to rest

Up at dawn to greet the sun
I've forgotten what a care or worry means
Head for home when day is done
With my pocket money jinglin' in my jeans

I´ve got a hundred and sixty acres full of sunshine
Got a hundred and sixty million stars above
Got an old paint hoss, I'm the guy who's boss
On the hundred and sixty acres that I love!

Marty Robbins,Billy the Kid,"I'll sing you a true song of Billy the Kid
I'll sing of some desperate deeds that he did
Way out in New Mexico long long ago
When a man's only chance was his own forty-four

When Billy the Kid was a very young lad
In old Silver City he went to the bad
Way out in the West with a gun in his hand
At the age of twelve years he did kill his first man
There's Mexican maidens play guitars and sing
Songs about Billy, their boy bandit king
'Ere his young manhood has reached his sad end
With a notch on his pistol for twenty one men!

Was on a sad night when poor Billy died
He said to his friend, ""I'm not satisfied
There's twenty one men I have put bullets through
Sheriff Pat Garrett must make twenty two!""

I'll sing you how Billy the Kid met his fate
The bright moon was shinin', the hour was late
Shot down by Pat Garrett who once was his friend
The young outlaw's life is now come to an end

There's many a man with a face fine and fair
Who start out in life with a chance to be square
Just like poor Billy they wander astray
They'll lose their lives in the very same way!"
Marty Robbins,Utah Carol,"And now my friends you've asked me what makes me sad and still
And why my brow is darkened like the clouds upon the hill
Run in your ponies closer and I'll tell to you my tale
Of Utah Carol my partner and his last ride on the trail

We rode the range together and rode it side by side
I loved him like a brother, and I wept when Utah died
We were rounding up one morning when work was almost done
When on his side the cattle started on a frightened run

Underneath the saddle that the boss's daughter rode
Utah that very morning had placed a bright red robe
So the saddle might ride easy for Lenore his little friend
And it was this red blanket that brought him to his end

The blanket was now dragging behind her on the ground
The frightened cattle saw it and charged it with a bound
Lenore then saw her danger and turned her pony's face
And leaning in the saddle tied the blanket to its place

But in leaning lost her balance, fell in front of that wild tide
""Lay still Lenore I'm coming"" were the words that Utah cried
His faithful pony saw her and reached her with a bound
I thought he'd been successful, and raised her from the ground

But the weight upon the saddle had not been felt before
His backcinch snapped like thunder and he fell by Lenore
Picking up the blanket he swung it over his head
And started cross the prairie, ""Lay still Lenore"" he said

When he got the stampede turned and saved Lenore his friend
Then turned to face the cattle and meet his fatal end
His six gun flashed like lightning, the report rang loud and clear
As the cattle rushed and killed him he dropped the leading steer

On his funeral morning I heard the preacher say
""I hope we'll all meet Utah at the roundup far away""
Then they wrapped him in a blanket that saved his little friend
And it was this red blanket that brought him to his end"
Marty Robbins,Running Gun,"I rode out of Kansas City, going south to Mexico
I was running dodging danger,left the girl that I loved so
Far behind lay Kansas City and the past that I had earned
Twenty notches on my six gun marked the lessons I had learned
Many times I sold my fast gun for a place to lay my head
Till the nights began to haunt me by the men that I left dead
Couldn't stand it any longer with the life that I'd begun
So I said good-bye to Jeannie and became a running gun
I rode into Amarillo as the sun sank in the west
My thoughts in Kansas City and the girl that I love best
As I smiled and kissed her gently and then turned away to go
Said I'd send for her to meet me when I reached old Mexico
I had barely left the saddle and my foot just touched the ground
When a cold voice from the shadows told me not to turn around
Said he knew about my fast gun, knew the price paid by the law
Challenged by a bounty hunter, so I turned around to draw
I knew someday I'd meet him, for his hand like lightning flashed
My own gun stood in leather as his bullet tore its path
As my strength was slowly fading, I could see him walk away
And I knew that where I lie today, he too must lie some day
Now a crowd is slowly gathering but my eyes are growing dim
And my thoughts return to Jeannie and the home that we had planned
Oh please tell her, won't you mister, that she's still the only one
But a woman's love is wasted when she loves a running gun"
Marty Robbins,A White Sport Coat (And a Pink Carnation),"[Chorus]
A white sport coat and a pink carnation
I'm all dressed up for the dance
A white sport coat and a pink carnation
I'm all alone in romance

[Bridge]
Once you told me long ago
To the prom with me you'd go
Now you've changed your mind it seems
Someone else will hold my dreams

[Chorus]
A white sport coat and a pink carnation
And in a blue, blue mood
(A white sport coat and a pink carnation)
I'm all dressed up for the dance
(A white sport coat and a pink carnation)
I'm all alone in romance

[Bridge]
Once you told me long ago
To the prom with me you'd go
Now you've changed your mind it seems
Someone else will hold my dreams

[Outro / Chorus]
A white sport coat and a pink carnation
I'm in a blue, blue mood"
Marty Robbins,Streets of Laredo,"[Verse 1]
As I walked out in the streets of Laredo
As I walked out in Laredo one day
I spied a young cowboy, wrapped all in white linen
Wrapped in white linen, as cold as the clay

[Chorus]
Oh, beat the drum slowly and play the fife lowly
Sing the Death March as you carry me along
Take me to the  valley, there lay the sod o'er me
I'm a young cowboy and know I've done wrong

[Verse 2]
I see by your outfit that you are a cowboy
These words he did say as I boldly walked by
Come sit down beside me and hear my sad story
Got shot in the breast and I know I must die

[Verse 3]
Go fetch me some water, a cool cup of water
To cool my parched lips then the poor cowboy said
Before I returned, his spirit had left him
Had gone to his maker, the cowboy was dead

[Chorus]
Oh, beat the drum slowly and play the fife lowly
Sing the Death March as you carry me along
Take me to the  valley, there lay the sod o'er me
I'm a young cowboy and know I've done wrong"
Marty Robbins,Cowboy In the Continental Suit,"Well, he walks out in the arena
All dressed up to the brim
Said he'd just came down from a place
Called ""Highland Rim""
Well, he said he came to ride the horse
The one they call ""The Brute""
But he didn't look like a cowboy
In his Continental Suit

We snickered at the way he dressed
But he never said a word
He walks on by the rest of us
As if he hadn't heard
A thousand bucks went to the man
Who could ride this wild cayuse
A meaner horse was never born
Than the one they called ""The Brute""

The horse that he was looking for
Was in chute number eight
He walked up very slowly
Put his hand upon the gate
We knew he was a thoroughbred
When he pulled his sack of ""Dukes""
From the inside pocket
Of his Continental Suit

Well, he rolled hisself a ""Corley""
And he lit it standing there
Blew himself a smoke ring
And he watched it disappear
We thought he must be crazy
When he opened up the gate
Standing just inside was
Fifeteen hundred pounds of hate

The Buckskin tried to run him down
But the stranger was too quick
He stepped aside and threw his arms
Around the horse's neck
And pulled himself up on the back
Of the horse they called ""The Brute""
Sit like he was born there
In his Continental Suit

""The Brute's"" hind-end was in the air
His front end on the ground
Kickin' and a-squealin', tryin' to
Shake this stranger down
But the stranger didn't give an inch
He came to ride ""The Brute""
And he came to ride the Buckskin
In a Continental Suit

Well, I turned around to look at Jim
And he was watchin' me
He said, ""I don't believe
The crazy things I think I see
But I think I see the outlaw
The one they call ""The Brute""
Ridden by a cowboy
In a Continental Suit""

""The Brute"" came to a stand-still
Ashamed that he'd been rode
By a city cowboy in
Some Continental clothes
The stranger took his money
And we don't know where he went
We don't know where he came from
And we haven't seen him since

The moral of this story:
Never judge by what they wear
Underneath some ragged clothes
Could be a millionaire
Everybody listen
Don't be fooled by this galoot
This sure-'nough bronc buster
In a Continental Suit"
Marty Robbins,The Hanging Tree,"[Verse 1]
I came to town to search for gold
And I brought with me a memory
And I seem to hear the night wind cry

""Go hang your dreams on the hangin' tree
Your dreams of love that could never be
Hang your faded dreams on the hangin' tree!""

(The hangin' tree)

[Verse 2]
I searched for gold and I found my gold
And I found a girl who loved just me
And I wished that I could love her too

But I'd left my heart on the hangin' tree
I'd left my heart with a memory (a memory)
And a faded dream on the hangin' tree

(The hangin' tree)

[Verse 3]
Now there were men who craved my gold
And meant to take (ooh) my gold from me
When a man is gone he needs no gold

So they carried me to the hangin' tree
To join my dreams and a memory (a memory)
Yes, they carried me to the hangin' tree

(The hangin' tree)

[Verse 4]
To really live you must almost die (wop doo-wah)
And it happened just that way with me (wop doo-wah)
They took the gold and set me free

(Ah) And I walked away from the hangin' tree
I walked away from the hangin' tree
(the hangin' tree)
And my own true love, she walked with me!

[Bridge]
That's when I knew that the hangin' tree
Was a tree of life, new life for me
A tree of hope, new hope for me
A tree of love, new love for me
The hangin' tree (the hangin' tree)
The hangin' tree (the hangin' tree)
The hangin' tree! (the hangin' tree)"
Marty Robbins,Don’t Worry,"[Verse 1]
Don't worry 'bout me
It's all over now
Though I may be blue
I'll manage somehow

[Verse 2]
Love can't be explained
Can't be controlled
One day it's warm
Next day it's cold

[Verse 3]
Don't pity me
'Cause I'm feeling blue
Don't be ashamed
It might have been you

[Verse 4]
Oh, oh, oh, ohh, ohh, love
Kiss me one time, then go, love
I'll understand
Don't worry 'bout me

[Bridge]

[Verse 5]
Sweet, sweet, sweet, love
I want you to be
As happy as I
When you love me

[Verse 6]
I'll never forget you
Your sweet memory
It's all over now
Don't worry bout me

[Bridge]
When one heart tells
One heart
One heart goodbye
One heart is free
One heart will cry

Oh, oh, oh, ohh, oh sweet
Sweet baby, sweet, baby sweet
It's alright
Don't worry 'bout me

Marty Robbins,Saddle Tramp,"They call me a drifter, they say I'm no good
I'll never amount to a thing
Well I may be a drifter and I may be no good
There's joy in this song that I sing

Saddle tramp, saddle tramp
I'm as free as the breeze and I ride where I please
Saddle tramp, saddle tramp

At night I will rest 'neath a blanket of blue
Doubt if I ever will change
I might even dream of a lady I knew
Might even whisper her name

Saddle tramp, saddle tramp
I'm as free as the breeze and I ride where I please
Saddle tramp, saddle tramp
I might even wind up in Idaho
And visit a cute little miss
A sweet little someone I used to know
And I might even stop long enough for a kiss
Saddle tramp, saddle tramp
I'm as free as the breeze and I ride where I please
Saddle tramp, saddle tramp

Might even ride back through Phoenix someday
Might even stop for awhile
But branded, no never! I'll not be tied down
Trapped by a fair lady's smile

Saddle tramp, saddle tramp
I'm as free as the breeze and I ride where I please
Saddle tramp!"
Marty Robbins,Red River Valley,"From this valley they say you are leaving
We shall miss your bright eyes and sweet smile
For you take with you all of the sunshine
That has brightened our pathway a while

Then come sit by my side if you love me
Do not hasten to bid me adieu
Just remember the Red River Valley
And the cowboy that's loved you so true

For a long time, my darlin', I've waited
For the sweet words you never would say
Now at last all my fond hopes have vanished
For they say that you're going away

Then come sit by my side if you love me
Do not hasten to bid me adieu
Just remember the Red River Valley
And the cowboy that's loved you so true"
Marty Robbins,The Story of My Life,"[Verse 1]
Someday I'm gonna write, the story of my life
I'll tell about the night we met
And how my heart can't forget
The way, you smiled, at me

[Verse 2]
I want the world to know, the story of my life
The moment when your lips met mine
And that first exciting time
I held, you close, to me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The sorrow when our love was breaking up
The memory of a broken heart
Then later on the joy of making up
Never, never more to part

[Chorus 2]
There's a one thing left to do, before my story's through
I've got to take you for my wife
So the story of my life
Can start, and end, with you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
The sorrow when our love was breaking up
The memory of a broken heart
Then later on the joy of making up
Never, never more to part

[Chorus 2]
There's a one thing left to do, before my story's through
I've got to take you for my wife
So the story of my life
Can start, and end, can start, and end, can start, and end, with you"
Marty Robbins,"My Woman, My Woman, My Wife","[Verse 1]
Hands that are strong but wrinkled
Doing work that never gets done
Hair that's lost some of the beauty
By too many hours in the sun
Eyes that show some disappointment
And there's been quite a lot in her life

[Chorus]
She's the foundation I lean on
My woman, my woman, my wife

[Verse 2]
Everyday has been uphill
We climb but we can't reach the top
I'm weak and I'm easily discouraged
She just smiles when I want to stop
Lips, that are weary but tender
With love that strengthens my life

[Chorus]
A saint in a dress made of gingham
My woman, my woman, my wife

[Verse 3]
Two little babies were born in the spring
But died when the winter was new
I lost control of my mind, and my soul
But my woman's faith carried us through

[Verse 4]
When she reaches that river
Lord you know what she's worth
Give her that mansion up yonder
Cause she's been through hell here on earth
Lord give her my share of heaven
If I've earned any here in this life

[Chorus / Outro]
Cause God I believe she deserves it
My woman, my woman, my wife"
Kenny Chesney,Get Along,"[Verse 1]
Met a man wearin' a T-shirt, said ""Virginia is for lovers""
Had a Bible in his left hand and a bottle in the other
He said ""All you're really given is the sunshine and your name""
We both started laughin' when the sky started to rain

[Chorus]
Get along, on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try
Get along while we can
Always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall, learn to dance
Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along?

[Verse 2]
Saw a model on a billboard, 1-800 get to know me
Wondered was she Photoshopped, or were her eyes really that lonely?
Did she leave her hometown thinkin' she'd end up in L.A.?
Did she break down in the desert and get stuck beside the highway?

[Chorus]
Get along, on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try
Get along while we can
Always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall, learn to dance
Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along?

[Bridge]
We find out when you die the keys to Heaven can't be bought
We still don't know what love is but we sure know what it's not
Sometimes you got to

[Chorus]
Get along, on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try
Get along while we can
Always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall, learn to dance
Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along?"
Kenny Chesney,American Kids,"[Verse 1]
Doublewide Quick Stop midnight T-top
Jack in her Cherry Coke town
Momma and Daddy put their roots right here
‘Cause this is where the car broke down
Yellow dawn school bus kickin’ up red dust
Pickin’ us up by a barbed wire fence
MTV on the RCA, no A/C in the vents

[Chorus]
We were Jesus saved me, blue jean baby
Born in the USA
Trailer park truck stop, faded little map dots
New York to LA
We were teenage dreamin’, front seat leanin’
Baby, come give me a kiss
Put me on the cover of the Rolling Stone
Uptown down home American kids
Growin’ up in little pink houses
Makin’ out on living room couches
Blowin’ that smoke on a Saturday night
A little messed up, but we’re all alright

[Verse 2]
Baptist church parkin’ lot, tryin’ not to get caught
Take her home and give her your jacket
Makin’ it to second base, but sayin’ you went all the way
Monday afternoon at practice
Sister's got a boyfriend Daddy doesn’t like
Now he’s sittin’ out back, .30-.30 in his lap
In the blue bug zapper light

We were Jesus saved me, blue jean baby
Born in the USA

Kenny Chesney,Better Boat,"[Verse 1]
I ain't lonely, but I spend a lot of time alone
More than I'd like to, but I’m okay with stayin' home
My how the last few months have changed
I’m smilin' more despite the pain

[Chorus]
I breathe in, I breathe out
Got friends to call who let me talk about
What ain't workin', what’s still hurtin'
All the things I feel like cussin' out
Now and then I let it go, I ride the waves I can't control
I'm learnin' how to build a better boat

[Verse 2]
I hate waitin', ain't no patience in these hands
I'm not complainin', sometimes it's hard to change a man
I think I'm stronger than I was
I let God do what he does

[Chorus]
I breathe in, I breathe out
Got friends to call who let me talk about
What ain't workin', what’s still hurtin'
All the things I feel like cussin'  out
Now and then I let it go, I ride the waves I can't control
I'm learnin' how to build a better boat

[Chorus]
I breathe in, I breathe out
Got friends to call who let me talk about
What ain't workin', what’s still hurtin'
All the things I feel like cussin' out

If it's workin', I don't know, when I get done the thing may not float
But I'm learnin' how to build a better boat"
Kenny Chesney,There Goes My Life,"[Verse 1]
All he could think about was
""I'm too young for this
Got my whole life ahead
Hell, I'm just a kid myself
How am I gonna raise one?

[Verse 2]
All he could see were his dreams
Going up in smoke
So much for ditching this town
And hangin' out on the coast
Oh well
Those plans are long gone, and he said

[Chorus]
There goes my life
There goes my future, my everything
Might as well kiss it all goodbye
There goes my life

[Verse 3]
A couple years of up all night
And a few thousand diapers later
That mistake he thought he made
Covers up the refrigerator
Oh yeah
He loves that little girl

[Verse 4]
Mama's waiting to tuck her in
As she fumbles up those stairs
She smiles back at him
Dragging that teddy bear
Sleep tight
Blue eyes and bouncing curls

[Chorus]
He smiles, there goes my life
There goes my future, my everything
I love you, daddy, goodnight
There goes my life

[Bridge]
She had that Honda loaded down
With Abercrombie clothes and fifteen pairs of shoes
And his American Express
He checked the oil and slammed the hood
Said, ""You're good to go""
She hugged them both and headed off to the West Coast

[Chorus]
And he cried, ""There goes my life
There goes my future, my everything
I love you, baby, goodbye""
There goes my life

There goes my life
Baby, goodbye
Baby, goodbye
There goes my life"
Kenny Chesney,Setting the World on Fire,"[Verse 1: Kenny Chesney + Together]
Yeah we got drunk on La Cienega Boulevard
Takin' pictures of people we thought were stars
It’s easy to give in to your heart
When you’re drunk on La Cienega Boulevard
When the song comin' out of the speakers
Was the band that you had on your t-shirt
We were screamin' cause all the streets were empty
And you kissed me, and we were …

[Chorus: Pink]
Up all night and we were feelin' so good
Yeah, we got a little higher than we probably should
We were in a hotel singin' in the hallway lights
We were strikin' the matches right down to the ashes
Setting the world on fire, setting the world on fire

[Verse 2: Kenny Chesney + Together]
Wrote I love you in lipstick on the mirror
We were shoutin' out the window, like they could hear us at the pier
Said ""Do you think we’ll live forever?"" As we killed another beer
And you wrote I love you in lipstick on the mirror
We were laughin' until we were breathless
Never felt anything so reckless, we were all lit up and restless
And comin' alive and we were…

[Chorus: Pink]
Up all night and we were feelin' so good
Yeah, we got a little higher than we probably should
We were in a hotel singin' in the hallway lights
We were strikin' the matches right down to the ashes
Setting the world on fire, setting the world on fire

Oh, yeah, yeah

Kenny Chesney,She Thinks My Tractor’s Sexy,"[Verse 1]
Plowin' these fields in the hot summer sun
Over by the gate, lordy, here she comes
With a basket full of chicken and a big cold jug of sweet tea
I make a little room and she climbs on up
Open up a throttle and stir a little dust
Just look at her face, she ain’t a foolin' me

[Chorus]
She thinks my tractor's sexy
It really turns her on
She's always starin' at me
While I'm chuggin' along
She likes the way it's pullin' while we're tillin' up her land
She's even kinda crazy 'bout my farmer's tan
She's the only one who really understands what gets me
She thinks my tractor's sexy

[Verse 2]
We ride back and forth 'til we run out of light
Take it to the barn, put it up for the night
Climb up in the loft, sit, and talk with the radio on
She said she's got a dream and I ask what it is
She wants a little farm and a yard full of kids
And one more teeny weenie ride before I take her home

[Chorus]
She thinks my tractor's sexy
It really turns her on
She's always starin' at me
While I'm chuggin' along
She likes the way it's pullin' while we're tillin' up the land
She's even kinda crazy 'bout my farmer's tan
She's the only one who really understands what gets me
She thinks my tractor's sexy

[Bridge]
Well, she ain’t into cars or pickup trucks
But if it runs like a Deere, man, her eyes light up

[Chorus]
She thinks my tractor
She thinks my tractor's sexy
It really turns her on
She's always starin' at me
While I'm chuggin' along
She likes the way it's pullin' while we're tilling' up her land

She thinks my tractor's sexy
She thinks my tractor's sexy

Kenny Chesney,Anything But Mine,"[Verse 1]
Walking alone beneath the lights of that miracle mile
Me and Mary making our way into the night
You can hear the cries from the carnival rides
The pinball bells, ski ball slides
Watching the summer sun fall out of sight
There's a warm wind coming in from off of the ocean
Making it's way past the hotel walls to fill the streets
Mary is holding both of her shoes in her hands
Said she likes to feel the sand beneath her feet

[Chorus]
And in the morning I'm leaving, making my way back to Cleveland
So tonight I hope that I will do just fine
And I don't see how you could ever be anything but mine

[Verse 2]
There's a local band playing at the sea side pavilion
And I got just enough cash to get us in
And as we are dancing Mary's wrapping her arms around me
And I can feel the sting of summer on my skin
In the midst of the music I tell her I love her
We both laugh cause we know it isn't true
But Mary there's a summer drawing to an end tonight
And there's so much that I long to do to you

[Chorus]
But in the morning I'm leaving, making my way back to Cleveland
So tonight I hope that I will do just fine
And I don't see how you could ever be anything but mine

[Break]
Oo, oo

[Chorus]
And in the morning I'm leaving, making my way back to Cleveland
So tonight I hope that I will do just fine
And I don't see how you could ever be anything but mine

Mary I don't see how you could ever be anything but mine

[Break]
Oo, oo

[Chorus]
And in the morning I'm leaving, making my way back to Cleveland
So tonight I hope that I will do just fine
Hey, I don't see how you could ever be anything but mine"
Kenny Chesney,Wild Child,"[Verse 1]
Looks like royal in a thrift store dress
Keeps my heart and her hair a mess
She goes where the wind suggests she goes, who knows
Got a spirit that can't be tamed
She's a calico pony on an open plain
I know I'll never be the same no more, for sure

[Chorus]
She's a wild child
Got a rebel soul with a whole lot of gypsy wild style
She can't be tied down but for a while
I'll be falling free and so in love
Might break my heart but God she drives me wild child

[Verse 2]
You've never heard of her favorite band unless you
Been to Bonnaroo or Burning Man
She's Penny Lane in a Chevy van, she loves to love

[Chorus]
She loves me wild child
Got a rebel soul with a whole lot of gypsy wild style
She can't be tied down but for a while
I'll be falling free and so in love
Might break my heart but God she drives me wild child

[Bridge]
She'll be here until she runs
Some just have to chase the sun

[Chorus]
She's a wild child
Got a rebel soul with a whole lot of gypsy wild style
She can't be tied down but for a while
I'll be falling free and so in love
Might break my heart but God she drives me wild child

[Verse 3]
A kaleidoscope of colors in her mind child
A touch of crazy hides behind her wild smile
So simple yet experimental
Innocent but still a little wild child

[Outro]
Wild child"
Kenny Chesney,All the Pretty Girls,"[Verse 1]
All the pretty girls said pick me up at eight
All the pretty girls said I'm going to L.A
All the pretty girls said I hate my hair
Talking to the mirror in their underwear

All the lost boys said I just got paid
All the lost boys said I wanna get laid
When the town goes blue and the lights blink red
All the lost boys do what all the pretty girls said

[Chorus]
I'm home for the summer, shoot out the lights
Don't blow my cover, oh I'm free tonight
I'm coming over, call all your friends
Somebody hold me, all the pretty girls said

[Post-Chorus]
All of the whiskey went to my head
Shut up and kiss me, all the pretty girls said

[Verse 2]
All the sheriffs said kid, you better slow down
All the preachers said it's the devil's playground
I wonder if they knew they were wasting their breath
All I ever heard was all the pretty girls said

[Chorus]
I'm home for the summer, shoot out the lights
Don't blow my cover, oh I'm free tonight
I'm coming over, call all your friends
Somebody hold me, all the pretty girls said

[Post-Chorus]
All of the whiskey went to my head
Shut up and kiss me, all the pretty girls said

[Bridge]
All the seventeens said I'm getting outta dodge
All the big dreams said I'm selling all I got
All the high rollers busy placing their bets
Me, I'm heading south cause all the pretty girls said

[Chorus]
I'm home for the summer, shoot out the lights
Don't blow my cover, oh I'm free tonight
I'm coming over, call all your friends
Somebody hold me, all the pretty girls said

[Post-Chorus]
All of the whiskey went to my head
Shut up and kiss me, all the pretty girls said

[Outro]
All the pretty girls said"
Kenny Chesney,The Good Stuff,"[Verse 1]
Well, me and my lady had our first big fight
So I drove around 'til I saw the neon lights
Of a corner bar, and it just seemed right so I pulled up
Not a soul around but the old bar keep
Down at the end and looking half asleep
But he walked up, and said, ""What'll it be?""
I said, ""The good stuff""

[Pre-Chorus 1]
He didn't reach around for the whiskey
He didn't pour me a beer
His blue eyes kind of went misty
He said ""You can't find that here""

[Chorus 1]
'Cause it's the first long kiss on a second date
Mama's all worried when you get home late
And dropping the ring in the spaghetti plate
'Cause your hands are shaking so much
And it's the way that she looks with the rice in her hair
Eating burnt suppers the whole first year
And asking for seconds to keep her from tearing up
Yeah, man, that's the good stuff

[Verse 2]
He grabbed a carton of milk and he poured a glass
And I smiled and said, ""I'll have some of that""
We sat there and talked as an hour passed, like old friends
I saw a black and white picture and it caught my stare
It was a pretty girl with bouffant hair
He said, ""That's my Bonnie
Taken about a year after we were wed""

[Pre-Chorus 2]
He said, ""Spent five years in the bottle
When the cancer took her from me
But I've been sober three years now
'Cause the one thing stronger than the whiskey

[Chorus 2]
Was the sight of her holding my baby girl
The way she adored that string of pearls
I gave her the day that our youngest boy, Earl
Married his high school love
And it's a new T-shirt saying, ""I'm a Grandpa""
Being right there as our time got small
And holding her hand, when the Good Lord called her up
Yeah, man, that's the good stuff""

[Outro]
He said, ""When you get home, she'll start to cry
When she says, ""I'm sorry,"" say, ""So am I""
And look into those eyes, so deep in love
And drink it up
'Cause that's the good stuff
That's the good stuff"
Kenny Chesney,Come Over,"{Verse 1}
I turn the TV off, to turn it on again
Staring at the blades of the fan as it spins around
Counting every crack, the clock is wide awake
Talking to myself, anything to make a sound

{Chorus}
I told you I wouldn’t call, I told you I wouldn’t care
But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I don’t think that I can take this bed getting any colder
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over

{Verse 2}
You can say we’re done the way you always do
It’s easier to lie to me than to yourself
Forget about your friends, you know they’re gonna say
We’re bad for each other, but we ain’t good for anyone else

{Chorus}
I told you I wouldn’t call, I told you I wouldn’t care
But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I don’t think that I can take this bed getting any colder
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over

{Bridge}
We don’t have to miss each other, come over
We don’t have to fix each other, come over
We don’t have to say forever, come over
You don’t have to stay forever, come over

{Chorus}
I told you I wouldn’t call, I told you I wouldn’t care
But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I don’t think that I can take this bed getting any colder
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over

{Outro}
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over"
Kenny Chesney,Don’t Blink,"[Verse 1]
I turned on the evening news
Saw a old man being interviewed
Turning a hundred and two today
Asked him what's the secret to life
He looked up from his old pipe
Laughed and said ""All I can say is.""

[Chorus]
Don't blink
Just like that you're six years old and you take a nap and you
Wake up and you're twenty-five and your high school sweetheart becomes your wife
Don't blink
You just might miss your babies growing like mine did
Turning into moms and dads next thing you know your better half
Of fifty years is there in bed
And you're praying God takes you instead
Trust me friend a hundred years goes faster than you think
So don't blink

[Verse 2]
I was glued to my TV when it looked like he looked at me and said
""Best start putting first things first.""
'Cause when your hourglass runs out of sand
You can't flip it over and start again
Take every breathe God gives you for what it's worth

[Chorus]
Don't blink
Just like that you're six years old and you take a nap and you
Wake up and you're twenty-five and your high school sweetheart becomes your wife
Don't blink
You just might miss your babies growing like mine did
Turning into moms and dads next thing you know your better half
Of fifty years is there in bed
And you're praying God takes you instead
Trust me friend a hundred years goes faster than you think
So don't blink

[Bridge]
So I've been tryna slow it down
I've been tryna take it in
In this here today gone tomorrow world we're livin' in

[Chorus]
Don't blink
Just like that you're six years old and you take a nap and you
Wake up and you're twenty-five and your high school sweetheart becomes your wife
Don't blink
You just might miss your babies growing like mine did
Turning into moms and dads next thing you know your better half
Of fifty years is there in bed
And you're praying God takes you instead
Trust me friend a hundred years goes faster than you think
So don't blink

[Outro]
Now, don't blink
Don't blink
Life goes faster than you think
So don't blink
Life goes faster than you think
Don't blink
Don't blink
Life goes faster than you think"
Kenny Chesney,You and Tequila,"[Verse 1]
Baby, here I am again
Kicking dust in the canyon wind
Waiting for that sun to go down
Made it up Mulholland Drive
Hellbent on getting high
High above the lights of town

[Chorus]
You and tequila make me crazy
Run like poison in my blood
One more night could kill me, baby
One is one too many, one more is never enough

[Verse 2]
Thirty days and thirty nights
Been putting up a real good fight
There were times I thought you'd win
It's so easy to forget
The bitter taste the morning left
Swore I wouldn't go back there again

[Chorus]
You and tequila make me crazy
Run like poison in my blood
One more night could kill me, baby
One is one too many, one more is never enough

[Bridge]
When it comes to you
Oh, the damage I could do
It's always your favorite sins
That do you in

[Chorus]
You and tequila make me crazy
Run like poison in my blood
One more night could kill me, baby
One is one too many, one more is never enough

[Outro]
Never enough
You and tequila
You and tequila make me crazy"
Kenny Chesney,Summertime,"[Verse 1]
Summertime is finally here
That old ballpark, man, is back in gear
Out on 49
Man I can see the lights

School's out and the nights roll in
Man, just like a long lost friend
You ain't seen in a while
And can't help but smile

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's two bare feet on the dashboard
Young love and an old Ford
Cheap shades and a tattoo
And a Yoo-Hoo bottle on the floorboard

[Chorus]
Perfect song on the radio
Sing along cause it's one we know
It's a smile, it's a kiss
It's a sip of wine, it's summertime
Sweet summertime

[Verse 2]
Temperature says 93
Down at the Deposit and Guarantee
But that swimming hole
It's nice and cold

Bikini bottoms underneath
But the boys' hearts still skip a beat
When them girls shimmy off
Them old cutoffs

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's two bare feet on the dashboard
Young love and an old Ford
Cheap shades and a tattoo
And a Yoo-Hoo bottle on the floorboard

[Chorus]
Perfect song on the radio
Sing along cause it's one we know
It's a smile, it's a kiss
It's a sip of wine, it's summertime
Sweet summertime

[Bridge]
The more things change
The more they stay the same
Don't matter how old you are
When you know what I'm talking 'bout
Yeah baby when you got

[Pre-Chorus]
Two bare feet on the dashboard
Young love and an old Ford
Cheap shades and a tattoo
And a Yoo-Hoo bottle Rollin on the floorboard

[Chorus]
Perfect song on the radio
Sing along cause it's one we know
It's a smile, it's a kiss
It's a sip of wine, it's summertime
Sweet summertime"
Kenny Chesney,Somewhere with You,"[Verse 1]
If you're going out with someone new
I'm going out with someone too
I won't feel sorry for me
I'm getting drunk, but I'd much rather be

[Pre-Chorus]
Somewhere with you, laughing loud on a carnival ride
Yeah, driving around on a Saturday night
You made fun of me for singing my song
Got a hotel room just to turn you on
You said, ""Pick me up at three a.m.""
You're fighting with your mom again
And I'd go, I'd go, I'd go somewhere with you

[Verse 2]
I won't sit outside your house
And wait for the lights to go out
Call up that ex to rescue me
Climb in their bed when I'd much rather sleep

[Pre-Chorus]
Somewhere with you, like we did on the beach last summer
When the rain came down and we took cover
Down in your car out by the pier
You laid me down, whispered in my ear
""I hate my life, hold on to me
Ah, if you ever decide to leave
Then I'll go, I'll go, I'll go""

[Chorus]
I can go out every night of the week
Can go home with anybody I meet
But it's just a temporary high
'Cause when I close my eyes
I'm somewhere with you
Somewhere with you

[Verse 3]
If you see me out on the town
And it looks like I'm burning it down
You won't ask and I won't say
But in my heart I'm always

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Somewhere with you, laughing loud on a carnival ride
Yeah, driving around on a Saturday night
You made fun of me for singing my song
Got a hotel room just to turn you on
You said, ""Pick me up at three a.m.""
You're fighting with your mom again
And I'd go, I'd go, I'd go

[Chorus]
I can go out every night of the week
Can go home with anybody I meet
But it's just a temporary high
'Cause when I close my eyes
I'm somewhere with you
Somewhere with you

[Outro]
Somewhere with you
I'm somewhere with you
I'm somewhere with you
Somewhere with you
Somewhere with you"
Kenny Chesney,Take Her Home,"[Verse 1]
Downtown looks like it's New Year's Eve
You find some bar you can halfway breathe
TouchTunes some old deep-cut Cheap Trick
Got your girl singin' every word of it
So you bring a couple shots of chilled Patron
To the prettiest thing that you ever hit on
And somehow she ain't got a boyfriend
So you make her laugh all night and then

[Chorus]
Take her home, fall in love
Thank the good Lord up above
That He sent one down into your arms
And put a chain around your raised-hell heart
You try to play it cool walkin' through the door
But you're smilin' like a fool 'cause you can't wait for
Them down-thе-road memories you're bound to makе
And you will one day take her home

[Verse 2]
Got a stuffed truck sittin' in the driveway
In the back there's a black and a pink suitcase
She can't stop sayin' she's freakin' out
You say, ""Baby, you ain't got nothin' to worry about""
Then you hold her hand, kiss her one time
And throw it in drive

[Chorus]
And take her home, and fall in love
Thank the good Lord up above
That He sent one down into your arms
And put a chain around your raised-hell heart
You try to play it cool walkin' through the door
But you're smilin' like a fool 'cause you can't wait for
Them down-the-road memories you're bound to make
And you will one day take her home

[Post-Chorus]
Take her home

[Bridge]
Sometimes God draws life like a dream
Paints you a seven-pound five-ounce scene
In a car seat creepin' down the interstate
Two young lovers that are scared to death but still can't wait

[Chorus]
To take her home, fall in love
Thank the good Lord up above
That He sent one down into your arms
And put a chain around your raised-hell heart
You try to play it cool walkin' through the door
But you're smilin' like a fool 'cause you can't wait for
Them down-the-road memories you're bound to make
And you will one day take her home

[Outro]
(Take her home, take her home, take her home)
Take her home
(Take her home, take her home, take her home)"
Kenny Chesney,I Go Back,"[Verse 1]
""Jack and Diane"" painted a picture of my life and my dreams
Suddenly this crazy world made more sense to me
Well I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
Because every time I hear that song

[Chorus]
I go back to a two toned short bed Chevy
Driving my first love out to the levee
Living life with no sense of time
And I go back to the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
Wishing time would stop right in its tracks
Every time I hear that song, I go back
I go back

[Verse 2]
I used to rock all night long to ""Keep On Rocking Me Baby""
Frat parties, college bars, just trying to impress the ladies
Well I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
Because every time I hear that song

[Chorus]
And I go back to the smell of an old gym floor
And the taste of salt on a Carolina shore
After graduation and drinking goodbye to friends
And I go back to watchin summer fade to fall
Growin up too fast and I do recall
Wishin time would stop right in its tracks
Everytime I hear that song, I go back
I go back

[Bridge]
We all have a song that somehow stamped our lives
Takes us to another place and time

[Chorus]
So I go back to a pew, preacher, and a choir
Singing bout God, brimstone, and fire
And the smell of Sunday chicken after church
And I go back to the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him
Now ""Only The Good Die Young"" stops me in my tracks
Every time I hear that song
I go back

[Verse 3]
I go back
To the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
I go back (I go back)
To watching summer fade to fall
Growing up too fast and I do recall
I go back (I go back)
To the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him
I go back, I go back, I go back"
Kenny Chesney,"No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problems","[Verse 1]
I've been up to my neck working six days a week
Wearing holes in the soles of the shoes on my feet
Been dreaming of gettin' away since I don't know
Ain't no better time than now for Mexico

[Chorus]
No shoes, no shirt and no problems
Blues, what blues? Hey, I forgot 'em
The sun and the sand and a drink in my hand with no bottom
And no shoes, no shirt and no problems
No problems

[Verse 2]
Want a towel on a chair in the sand by the sea
Wanna look through my shades and see you there with me
Wanna soak up life for a while in laid back mode
No boss, no polite, no stress, no dress code

[Chorus]
No shoes, no shirt and no problems
Blues, what blues? Hey, I forgot 'em
The sun and the sand and a drink in my hand with no bottom
And no shoes, and no shirt and no problems
Babe, let's get packed tank tops and flip-flops if you got 'em
No shoes, and no shirt and no problems
No problems"
Kenny Chesney,Tip of My Tongue,"[Verse 1]
I love the dimples in the small of your back
The way they're speaking to me just like that
Red wine made my imagination run
Oh, I can taste it on the tip of my tongue

[Pre-Chorus]
Let it run, let it roll
Baby, I am under your control
Love me fast, kiss me slow
Hang on to anything you can hold

[Chorus]
It's a long way down
To where I wanna go
It's a long way down
To the center of your soul
It's a long way down
And I'm a loaded gun
But I love your salt and sugar on the tip of my tongue

[Verse 2]
Girl, believe me when I say it's true
Nobody makes me feel the way you do
Well, I love you from the morning 'til the setting sun, yeah
I can taste the ocean on the tip of my tongue

[Pre-Chorus]
Let it run, let it roll
Baby, I am under your control
Love me fast, kiss me slow
Hang onto anything you can hold

[Chorus]
It's a long way down
To where I wanna go
It's a long way down
To the center of your soul
It's a long way down
And I'm a loaded gun
But I love your salt and sugar on the tip of my tongue
Yeah, I love your salt and sugar on the tip of my tongue

[Bridge]
It's a long way down
It's a long way down

[Chorus]
It's a long way down
And I'm a loaded gun
But I love your salt and sugar on the tip of my tongue
Yeah, I love your salt and sugar on the tip of my tongue

[Outro]
I wanna love you 'til my days are done
I wanna tell you that I think that you're the one
Oh girl, you know when it's all said and done
Everything about you's on the tip of my tongue"
Kenny Chesney,The Boys of Fall,"[Verse 1]
When I feel that chill, smell that fresh cut grass
I'm back in my helmet, cleats and shoulder pads
Standing in the huddle listening to the call
Fans going crazy for the boys of fall
They didn't let just anybody in that club
Took every ounce of heart and sweat and blood
To get to wear those game day jerseys down the hall
Kings of the school man, were the boys of fall

[Chorus]
Well it's turn and face the Stars and Stripes
It's fighting back them butterflies
It's call it in the air, ""Alright yes, sir we want the ball""
And it's knocking heads and talking trash
It's slinging mud and dirt and grass
It's I got your number, I got your back when your back's against the wall
You mess with one man you got us all
The boys of fall

[Verse 2]
In little towns like mine that's all they got
Newspaper clippings fill the coffee shops
The old men will always think they know it all
Young girls will dream about the boys of fall

[Chorus]
Well it's turn and face the Stars and Stripes
It's fighting back them butterflies
It's call it in the air, ""Alright yes sir we want the ball""
And it's knocking heads and talking trash
It's slinging mud and dirt and grass
It's I got your number, I got your back when your back's against the wall
You mess with one man you got us all
The boys of fall

[Chorus]
Well it's turn and face the Stars and Stripes
It's fighting back them butterflies
It's call it in the air, ""Alright yes sir we want the ball""
And it's knocking heads and talking trash
It's slinging mud and dirt and grass
It's I got your number, I got your back when your back's against the wall
You mess with one man you got us all
The boys of fall

[Outro]
We're the boys of fall

We're the boys of fall"
Kenny Chesney,Knowing You,"[Verse 1]
Knowing you, you probably got your toes in the sand
At a bar on a beach in the sun somewhere
Knowing you, you got something cold in your hand
Chatting up a stranger without a care
Knowing you, you're still wild and free
And knowing you, you're probably way over me

[Chorus]
But God, we were so alive
I was a kid on a carnival ride
Holdin' my breath 'til the moment
When you were gonna leave me too soon
But I'd do it all over
'Cause, damn, it was good knowing you

[Verse 2]
Knowing you was a free-fall from a hundred thousand feet
When you don't even care where you land
And knowing you was the kind of rush that you feel
When you finally get to sit in with the band
And knowing you, you're still a tumbleweed
I only wish that you would tumble back to me

[Chorus]
But God, we were so alive
I was a kid on a carnival ride
Holdin' my breath 'til the moment
When you were gonna leave me too soon
But I'd do it all over
'Cause, damn, it was good knowing you

[Bridge]
Knowing you, you're still a tumbleweed
I only wish that you would tumble back to me

[Chorus]
'Cause God, we were so alive
I was a kid on a carnival ride
Holdin' my breath 'til the moment
When you were gonna leave me too soon
I'd do it all over
'Cause, damn, it was good
I'd do it all over
'Cause, damn, it was good knowing you"
Kenny Chesney,Save It For A Rainy Day,"[Verse 1]
It's no secret that lately there ain't no escape
And that I've been waking up alone
Just me and the TV and a sinking feeling
That you ain't ever coming home
But today, the tears ain't gonna hit the floor
Cause the boat's in the bay and it's calling my name
So I'm heading on out the door

[Chorus]
'Cause the sun's too bright, the sky's too blue
Beer's too cold to be thinking bout you
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
Save it for a rainy day

[Verse 2]
When I turned the ignition I knew I'd been missing
The feel of the wind on my face
I was stuck in a habit of wondering what happened
Too busy taking all the blame
But a drink or two is a foolproof remedy
It's a beautiful world with a beautiful girl
Kinda making eyes at me

[Chorus]
'Cause the sun's too bright, the sky's too blue
Beer's too cold to be thinking bout you
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
Save it for a rainy day

[Chorus 2]
Yeah, the music's too good, my friends are all out
And they're all too high to be bringing them down
If they ask about you, I've got nothing to say
I'll save it for a rainy day

[Verse 3]
There'll be plenty of time for what ifs and why's
And how'd I let you get away
But the lying in bed all stuck in my head
Is just gonna have to wait

[Chorus]
'Cause the sun's too bright, the sky's too blue
Beer's too cold to be thinking bout you
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
Save it for a rainy day

[Chorus 2]
Yeah, the music's too good, my friends are all out
And they're all too high to be bringing them down
If they ask about you, I've got nothing to say
I'll save it for a rainy day

[Outro]
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
Save it for a rainy day
Save it for a rainy day"
Kenny Chesney,You Had Me From Hello,"[Verse 1]
One word, that's all you said
Something in your voice called me, turned my head
Your smile, just captured me
You were in my future as far as I could see
And I don’t know how it happens, but it happens still
You asked me if I love you, if I always will

[Chorus]
Well you had me from hello
I felt love start to grow
The moment I looked into your eyes you won me
It was over from the start you completely stole my heart
And now you won't let go
I never even had a chance you know
You had me from hello

[Verse 2]
Inside I built a wall
So high around my heart, I thought I'd never fall
One touch, you brought it down
The bricks of my defenses scattered on the ground
And I swore to me I wasn't going to love again
The last time was the last time I'd let someone in

[Chorus]
But you had me from hello
I felt love start to grow
The moment I looked into your eyes you won me
It was over from the start you completely stole my heart
And now you won’t let go
I never even had a chance you know
You had me from hello

[Outro]
That’s all you said
Something in your voice calls me, turns my head
You had me from hello
You had me from hello
Girl, I've loved you from hello"
Kenny Chesney,Boston,"[Verse 1]
She comes from Boston, works at the jewelry store
Down in the harbor, where the ferries come to shore
She never really knew how good it would feel
To finally find herself in a place, so warm and real

[Chorus]
She wears a Red Sox cap to hide her baby dreads
The girl she was in New England, is different now and dead
In all the local bars, she flirts and tells the boys
While they're talking, she's from Boston

[Verse 2]
She comes from Boston, talks to her family, now and then
Through e-mails and post-cards, she tries to explain to them
That education and occupation will have to wait for now
She loves the Rosta Reggae rhythms, her dreams have changed somehow

[Chorus]
She wears a Red Sox cap to hide her baby dreads
The girl she was in New England, is different now and dead
In all the local bars, she flirts and tells the boys
While they're talking, she's from Boston

[Bridge]
Her toes dig deep and deeper in the sand
She's seduced by the sunsets and her new life at hand

[Chorus]
She wears a Red Sox cap to hide her baby dreads
The girl she was in New England, is different now and dead
In all the local bars, she flirts and tells the boys
While they're talking, she's from Boston

[Bridge]
She wears a Red Sox cap to hide her baby dreads

[Outro]
From Boston
She came to this island from Boston"
Kenny Chesney,Wherever You Are Tonight,"Don't know where I was when I first heard
That you had left for parts unknown
I struggled some to find the word
To convince myself that you were gone

If where we go defies all explanation
And on my pain there came a revelation

Hearts will break, we cry, we grieve
We die, we go, but never leave
We linger in the lives of those wе love
We’re flеsh and bone in beams of light
A body breaks, a soul takes flight
And faith is left to heal what tears can’t touch
You’re not gone, just out of sight
You’re here with me, wherever you are tonight

I am better now for who you were
You always found the truth in me
More patient than this world deserves
Everything a friend should be

If heaven is our final destination
The love we leave behind is our salvation

Hearts will break, we cry, we grieve
We die, we go, but never leave
We linger in the lives of those we love
We’re flesh and bone in beams of light
A body breaks, a soul takes flight
And faith is left to heal what tears can’t touch
You’re not gone, just out of sight
You’re here with me, wherever you are tonight

We’re flesh and bone in beams of light
A body breaks, a soul takes flight
And faith is left to heal what tears can’t touch
You’re not gone, just out of sight
You’re here with me, wherever you are tonight"
Tanya Tucker,Delta Dawn,"[Intro]
Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on?
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?
And did I hear you say he was a-meetin' you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky?

[Verse]
She's forty-one, and her daddy still calls her baby
All the folks around Brownsville say she's crazy
'Cause she walks downtown with her suitcase in her hand
Looking for a mysterious dark haired man
In her younger days, they called her Delta Dawn
Prettiest woman you ever laid eyes on
Then a man of low degree stood by her side
Promised her he'd take her for his bride

[Chorus]
Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on?
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?
And did I hear you say he was a-meetin' you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky?

[Bridge]
Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on?

To take you to his mansion in the sky?

Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?

Tanya Tucker,Bring My Flowers Now,"[Spoken Intro]
So I said, ""Listen, I got..."" and I said, uh, somethin' about, uh, goin' to somebody's funeral or something. She... I said, ""Man,"" I said, I said, ""Bring my flowers now, while I'm living""

[Chorus]
Bring my flowers now, while I'm living
I won't need your love when I'm gone
Don't spend time, tears, or money
On my old breathless body
If your heart is in them flowers, bring 'em on

[Verse 1]
All the miles cast a long shadow
I'd take a couple back if I could
I'd have learned to play guitar
Tell my daddy more I loved him
But I believe, for the most part, I done good

[Verse 2]
There's always sunrise and rainbows and babies
And the little things I cherish on my way
Even though one day
They'll bury me and Jesse Ray
I just know we're gonna ride again someday

[Chorus]
Bring my flowers now, while I'm living
I won't need your love when I'm gone
Don't spend time, tears, or money
On my ol' breathless body
Well, if your heart is in them flowers, bring 'em on

[Verse 3]
The days are long, but the years are lightning
They're bright and they will never strike again
I wish I'd been a better friend
A better daughter to my mother
There's no going back when your back's against the wind

[Verse 4]
So if you got love, then you're sittin' on a gold mine
And you can't take it with you when you go
So don't wait to help your sister
Forgive your brother and your neighbor
We all think we've got the time until we don't

[Chorus]
Bring my flowers now, while I'm living
I won't need your love when I'm gone
Don't spend time, tears, or money
On my old breathless body
If your heart is in them flowers, bring 'em on
If your heart is in them flowers, bring 'em on"
Tanya Tucker,Texas (When I Die),"[Chorus]
When I die I may not go to heaven
Well, I don't know if they let cowboys in
If they don't just let me go to Texas, boys
Texas is as close as I've been

[Verse 1]
New York couldn't hold my attention
Detroit City could not sing my song
If tomorrow finds me busted flat in Dallas
Well, I won't care 'cause at least I'll know I'm home

[Chorus]
When I die I may not go to heaven
Well, I don't know if they let cowboys in
If they don't just let me go to Texas, boys
Texas is as close as I've been

[Verse 2]
I'd ride through all of Hell
And half of Texas just to hear Merle Haggard sing a country song
Beer just ain't as cold in old Milwaukee
My body's here but my soul's in San Antone

[Chorus]
When I die I may not go to heaven
Well, I don't know if they let cowboys in
If they don't just let me go to Texas, boys
Texas is as close as I've been
When I die I may not go to heaven
Well, I don't know if they let cowboys in
If they don't just let me go to Texas, boys
Texas is as close as I've been
When I die I may not go to heaven
Well, I don't know if they let cowboys in
If they don't just let me go to Texas, boys
Texas is as close as I've been
When I die I may not go to heaven
Well, I don't know if they let cowboys in
If they don't just let me go to Texas, boys
Texas is as close as I've been"
Tanya Tucker,The Jamestown Ferry,"He just caught the Jamestown Ferry
It's not a hot day in January
Like he said it'd be
If he ever left me
A case of gone was all he carried
As he got on the Jamestown Ferry
And he said that gone was all he'd ever be

I didn't think that he'd leave me
After saying how much he needs me
But the fact still remains
I'm sittin' here all alone
Missin' the lovin' of my baby
Lord it's about to drive me crazy
He was the sweetest piece of heaven I've ever known

He just caught the Jamestown Ferry
It's not a hot day in January
Like he said it'd be
If he ever left me
A case of gone was all he carried
As he got on the Jamestown Ferry
He said that gone was all he'd ever be

As I walk through his kingdom
Of honkey-tonks and bars
I remember how he'd hold me
And comfort me with talk
He didn't cuss with every breath
He had a soothing southern drawl
Made me feel like a lady through it all

He just caught the Jamestown Ferry
It's not a hot day in January
Like he said it'd be
If he ever left me
A case of gone was all he carried
As he got on the Jamestown Ferry
He said that gone was all he'd ever be
He just caught the Jamestown Ferry

It's not a hot day in January
Like he said it'd be
If he ever left me"
Tanya Tucker,"What’s Your Mama’s Name, Child","[Intro]
What's your mama's name, child?
What's your mama's name?

[Verse 1]
Thirty some-odd years ago, a young man came to Memphis
Askin' 'bout a rose that used to blossom in his world
People never took the time to mind the young man's questions
Until one day they heard him ask a little green-eyed girl

[Chorus]
What's your mama's name, child? What's your mama's name?
Does she ever talk about a place called New Orleans?
Has she ever mentioned a man named Buford Wilson?
What's your mama's name, child? What's your mama's name?

[Verse 2]
Twenty some-odd years ago, a drunk down in Memphis
Lost a month of life and labor to the county jail
Just because he asked a little green-eyed girl a question
And offered her a nickel's worth of candy if she'd tell

[Verse 3]
A year and some-odd days ago, an old man died in Memphis
Just another wayward soul the county had to claim
Inside the old man's ragged coat, they found a faded letter
It said, ""You have a daughter and her eyes are Wilson green""

[Chorus]
What's your mama's name, child? What's your mama's name?
Does she ever talk about a place called New Orleans?
Has she ever mentioned a man named Buford Wilson?
What's your mama's name, child? What's your mama's name?

[Outro]
What's your mama's name, child?
What's your mama's name?"
Tanya Tucker,Would You Lay with Me (In a Field of Stone),"Would you lay with me in a field of stone
If my needs were strong, would you lay with me
Should my lips grow dry, would you wet them dear
In the midnight hour, if my lips were dry

Would you go away to another land
Walk a thousand miles through the burnin' sand
Wipe the blood away from my dyin' hand
If I give myself to you

Will you bathe with me in the stream of life
When the moon is full, will you bathe with me
Will you still love me, when I'm down and out
In my time of trial will you stand by me

Would you go away to another land
Walk a thousand miles through the burnin' sand
Wipe the blood away from my dyin' hand
If I give myself to you

Would you lay with me in a field of stone
(Would you lay with me in a field of stone)
Should my lips grow dry, would you wet them dear
(Should my lips grow dry, would you wet them dear)
Will you bathe with me in the stream of life
(Will you bathe with me in the stream of life)
Will you still love me, when I'm down and out"
Tanya Tucker,Two Sparrows in a Hurricane,"[Verse 1]
She's fifteen and he's barely driving a car
She's got his ring and he's got the keys to her heart
It's just a matter of time
They'll spread their wings and fly

[Chorus]
Like two sparrows in a hurricane
Trying to find their way
With a head full of dreams
And faith that can move anything
They've heard it's all uphill
But all they know is how they feel
The world says they'll never make it, love says they will

[Verse 2]
There's a baby crying and one more on the way
There's a wolf at the door with a big stack of bills they can't pay
The clouds are dark and the wind is high
But they can see the other side

[Chorus]
Like two sparrows in a hurricane
Trying to find their way
With a head full of dreams
And faith that can move anything
They've heard it's all uphill
But all they know is how they feel
The world says they'll never make it, love says they will

[Verse 3]
She's eighty-three and he's barely driving a car
She's got his ring and he's got the key to her heart
It's just a matter of time
They'll spread their wings and fly

[Chorus]
Like two sparrows in a hurricane
Trying to find their way
With a head full of dreams
And faith that can move anything
They've heard it's all uphill
But all they know is how they feel
The world says they'll never make it, love says they will"
Tanya Tucker,(Without You) What Do I Do With Me,"What do I do
Now that I'm on my own?
What we did together
Beats anything I've done alone
Since the day that you left
I've been asking myself
Is this how it's gonna be?
Without you
What do I do with me?

I don't want to go out
But I just can't stay home
I don't need company
But I sure don't want to be alone
And to tell myself that I'm doin' well
Is only makin' believe
Without you
What do I do with me?

Without you
Where do I go?
Where do I turn?
I'd sure like to know
What do I do
With all of our plans?
And how do I spend
All this time on my hands?

I've tried everything
I've been rackin' my brain
It must be as bad as it seems
Without you
What do I do with me?

Without you
What do I do with me?"
Tanya Tucker,Mustang Ridge,"[Chorus]
I'm never goin' back to Mustang Ridge
If I ever make it out alive
If you don't see me by the risin' sun
You'll know I had to take the dive
When the hounds are runnin' down Oso Creek
Like Arabs on the track
I'll be halfway 'cross the southern horn
Too late for turnin' back
And if I die tonight on the Hays Street Bridge
I ain't never goin' back to Mustang Ridge

[Verse 1]
I got my knee on the wheel and I'm feelin' free
With my hobnail on the gas
I just crossed over the county line
Tryna make it up to Wild Rose Pass
Now the radio's sayin' all hell broke loose
This mornin' at the Lockhart Jail
Now I'm flyin' like an angel on a dead man's run
I got the devil ridin' on my tail
(Yeah, I do)

[Chorus]
I'm never goin' back to Mustang Ridge
If I ever make it out alive
If you don't see me by the risin' sun
You'll know I had to take the dive
When the hounds are runnin' down Oso Creek
Like Arabs on the track
I'll be halfway 'cross the southern horn
Too late for turnin' back
And if I die tonight on the Hays Street Bridge
I'm never goin' back to Mustang Ridge

[Verse 2]
Did you hear they found an old burnt-out car
Up in the Davis Hills?
And the Sheriff said on the evening news
""Nobody found, but they're lookin' still""
Now a woman's life ain't just a list
Of the worst things she has done
I leave you now with a heart of stone
Sometimes the past is hard to outrun

[Chorus]
Never goin' back to Mustang Ridge
If I ever make it out alive
If you don't see me by the risin' sun
You'll know I had to take the dive
When the hounds are runnin' down Oso Creek
Like Arabs on the track
I'll be halfway 'cross the southern horn
Too late for turnin' back
And if I die tonight on the Hays Street Bridge
I'm never goin' back to Mustang Ridge

[Outro]
And if I die tonight on the Hays Street Bridge, oh Lord
I'm never goin' back to Mustang Ridge
I'm never goin' back to Mustang Ridge
I ain't never goin' back to Mustang Ridge, no"
Tanya Tucker,High Ridin’ Heroes,"[Verse 1]
Daylight or midnight
Red eyes and that old hat
Whiskey-bent and busted flat
She's a credit to her flaws
She's a bad risk, but a good friend
Small change and loose ends
She only regrets that she might've been
A little faster on the draw

[Chorus]
Those old high ridin' heroes
They're anywhere the wind blows
She's been to hell and Texas
And she knows how it feels
To be ridin' that hot streak
And drunk on some back street
Falling off the wagon
And under the wheels

[Verse 2]
Time was when she was queen
Now the rodeo's just this old girl's dream
The highs are few and far between
The lows get the rest
These old hard times ain't nothin' new
Once you've done the best you can do
You just tip your hat to the wild and blue
And you ride off to the west

[Chorus]
Those old high ridin' heroes
They're anywhere the wind blows
She's been to hell and Texas
And she knows how it feels
To be ridin' that hot streak
And drunk on some back street
Falling off the wagon
And under the wheels

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Those old high ridin' heroes
They're anywhere the wind blows
She's been to hell and Texas
And she knows how it feels
To be ridin' that hot streak
And drunk on some back street
Falling off the wagon
And under the wheels"
Tanya Tucker,I Don’t Owe You Anything,"[Intro]
One, two, three, four
Aw, I got somethin' to say

[Verse 1]
Well, it's a long walk down the hallway
But it's a short drive to the bank
Ain't it a bitch learnin' the hard way?
It might be easier than you think
Now, you can keep my tears and my good years
And your Sears and Roebuck ring
And I'll take this show on down the road
I don't owe you anything

[Chorus]
Well, I made your bed and I made your lunch
And for the last time, your clothes are out to dry
I know you like my own reflection
I see her in your eyes
Darling, I ain't growin' old with you
I don't need your front porch swing
I raised up all your babies
I don't owe you anything

[Verse 2]
Now despite your sin, you're gonna start again
A retired family man
With a younger wife than our own son
And a cat that you can't stand
You're gonna call me up in Vegas
'Cause you're lookin' for a fight
And I'll be over you with better things to do
On a perfectly good Saturday night

[Chorus]
Well, I made your bed and I made your lunch
And for the last time, your clothes are out to dry
I know you like my own reflection
I see her in your eyes
Darling, I ain't growin' old with you
I don't need your front porch swing
Well, I raised up all your babies
I don't owe you anything
Hey, I made your bed and I made your lunch
And for the last time, your clothes are out to dry
I know you like my own reflection
I see her in your eyes
Darling, I ain't growin' old with you
I don't need your front porch swing
Well, I raised up all your babies
I don't owe you anything

Hell, I raised up all your babies
And I don't owe you a god dang thing
Hell no, hahahaha"
Tanya Tucker,It’s a Little Too Late,"Well, I was up all night well wonderin' what to do
Thinkin' that I oughta just forget about you
But it's a little too late;
Well, it's a little too late
When you walked in I shoulda walked out
Well, it's a little too late to do the right thing now

Well, the whole town told me you're a heart break king;
Guess I oughta pay attention when they say those things
Well, it's a little too late
Well, it's a little too late
I know all my old buddies wanna help me out
But it's a little too late to do the right thing now

Turn the jukebox up throw some sawdust down
I'm too far gone to turn this heart around
I may be wrong but I don't walk out;
Well, it's a little too late to do the right thing now

Turn the jukebox up an' throw some sawdust down
I'm too far gone to turn this heart around
I may be wrong but I don't walk out;
Well, it's a little too late to do the right thing now

I was up all night well wonderin' what to do
Thinkin' that I oughta just forget about you
But it's a little too late;
Well, it's a little too late
When you walked in I shoulda walked out
Well, it's a little too late to do the right thing now

I may be wrong but I don't walk out
Well, it's a little too late to do the right thing now"
Tanya Tucker,The Wheels of Laredo,"[Verse 1]
On a winter night in Webb County, Texas
On the north bank of the mighty Rio Grande
I was watchin' the jungle fires a-burnin'
Across the border of a not-so-distant land
And the echoes of the church bells that were swingin'
Could be heard from Guadalupe Market Square
There was a girl down there on the south side of the river
She had feathers tied into her long black hair

[Chorus]
And if I was I was white-crowned sparrow
Well, I would float upon the southern skies of blue
But I'm stuck inside the wheels of Laredo
Wishin' I was rollin' back to you

[Verse 2]
I put on my favorite jacket for Jamboozie
I painted up my eyes and wore my beads
There was a band playin' ""To God Be the Glory""
There were people dancin' all around the street
There were barrels on the sidewalk that were burnin'
And a fortune-teller readin' people's hands
And I swear, I heard those church bells ringin'
'Cross the border of a not-so-distant land

[Chorus]
Singing, if I was white-crowned sparrow
Well, I would float upon the southern skies of blue
But I'm stuck inside the wheels of Laredo
Wishin' I was rollin' back to you
And if I was I was white-crowned sparrow
Well, I would float upon the southern skies of blue
But I'm stuck inside the wheels of Laredo
Wishin' I was rollin' back to you

[Outro]
I'm stuck inside the wheels of Laredo
Wishin' I was rollin' back to you
Wish I was rollin' back, back to you
Wish I was rollin' back to you
Wish I was rollin' back to you"
Tanya Tucker,The Day My Heart Grows Still,"[Chorus]
Yes, I know
Well, I know I will, I will
Love you 'til the day my heart goes still
Until they put me in the ground up on some hill
I don't think I'll ever get my fill
I'm gonna love you 'til the day my heart goes still

[Verse 1]
When I was younger
Lord knows I tried, I tried
I wish that I had somebody by my side
There were times I thought I'd get lost in fold
But you lived your life so fearlessly and bold
I'm gonna love you 'til the day my blood runs cold

[Chorus]
Yes, I know
Well, I know I will, I will
Love you 'til the day my heart goes still
Until they put me in the ground up on some hill
I don't think I'll ever get my fill
I'm gonna love you 'til the day my heart goes still

[Verse 2]
Now I ain't no young girl
But this I know, I know
I still got a long, long way to go
But if the good Lord should come knockin' at my door
I had everything I wanted and more
And if there's hell to pay when we settle up the score
I can always say I lived my life my way
No tomorrow for mistakes I made today

[Outro]
I don't think I'll ever get my fill
I don't think I'll ever get my fill
I don't think I'm ever gonna get my fill
I'm gonna love you 'til the day my heart goes still"
Tanya Tucker,Strong Enough to Bend,"There's a tree out in the back yard
That never has been broken by the wind
And the reason it's still standin'
It was strong enough to bend

For years we have stayed together
As lovers and as friends
What we have will last forever
If we're strong enough to bend

When you say somethin' that you can't take back
A big wind blows and you hear a crack
When you say ""Hey, well, I might be wrong,""
You can sway with the wind till the storm is gone
(Sway with the wind till the storm is gone.)

Like a tree
(Like a tree)
Out in the back yard
That never has been broken by the wind
Our love
(Our love)
Will last forever
If we're strong enough to bend

When you start thinkin' that you know it all
A big wind blows and a branch will fall
When you say ""Hey, this job takes two,""
We can sway with the wind till the skies turn blue
(Sway with the wind till the skies turn blue.)

Like the tree
(Like the tree)
Out in the back yard
That never has been broken by the wind
Our love
(Our love)
Will last forever
If we're strong enough to bend
Our love
(Our love)
Will last forever
If we're strong enough to bend"
Tanya Tucker,It’s a Cowboy Lovin’ Night,"They're tuning those twin Texas fiddles
It will soon be ""hold me"" time
I'm in such an easy mood

It's close to 4/4 time
All alone at a table for two
Just me and the candlelight
Shuffle with me, Houston stranger
It's a cowboy lovin' night

My last good time was in Dallas
We danced, every song
We promised each other forever
Forever didn't last that long

""Faded Love"" was playing
It could be the time was right
Shuffle with me, Houston stranger
It's a cowboy lovin' night

It's been so long since Dallas
Many lonely nights have come and gone
It may not last
But a dance or two
But it might last all night long

""Faded Love"" was playing
It could be the time was right
Shuffle with me, Houston stranger
It's a cowboy lovin' night

""Faded Love"" was playing
It could be the time was right
Shuffle with me, Houston stranger
It's a cowboy lovin' night"
Tanya Tucker,Hard Luck,"[Intro]
Oh, got a little story
Like my kinda luck

[Verse 1]
I still remember the night I was born
My shoes were ragged and my jeans were torn
No time to worry 'bout none of these things
My mouth was wide open, I just had to sing

[Chorus]
Hard luck, keep truckin’
I was born to a hard luck world
Hard luck, keep truckin'
Lord knows I'm a hard luck girl

My daddy told me when I was young
""Girl, don’t you do what ol' Hank Williams done
Now look at my life and all the trouble I've had
Shows what you get when you got to be bad""

Hard luck, keep truckin'
Born to a hard luck world
Hard luck, I keep truckin'
Lord knows I'm a hard luck girl

Wind it up
My luck's changin'

[Bridge]
Oh, my story’s so sad
Aw yeah, aw, so bad
Now listen up y’all

'Cause I was foolish and I wouldn’t heed
I knew my crazy ways were bound to succeed
Nobody's fault, and I won't pass a buck
It was my own hard head and a little bit of

Hard luck, keep on truckin’

Tanya Tucker,Lizzie and the Rainman,"[Verse 1]
He came riding in on the sunrise
On a hot west Texas day
A fancy man in a painted wagon
With some fancy things to say
Looks like you folks need some water
Well, water is my game
And for the small price of $100
I betcha I can make it rain

[Chorus]
Step back, non-believers
Or the rain will never come
Someone start that fire a-burning
Somebody beat the drum
He said some may think I'm crazy
For making all these claims
But I swear before this day is over
You folks are gonna see some rain

[Verse 2]
They all just stood there a-staring
Trying to believe
But there was one named Lizzie Cooper
Who said he was a lying cheat
She said you call yourself a Rainman
Well, you oughta be ashamed
Starting all these people dreaming
Thinking you can make it rain

[Chorus]
Step back, non-believers
Or the rain will never come
Someone keep that fire a-burning
Somebody beat the drum
He said some may think I'm crazy
For making all these claims
But I swear before this day is over
You folks are gonna see some rain

[Verse 3]
Hey Lizzie
Well, a man's got to have a dream
And if you can't walk on the inside with me
I'll meet you in between
Oh, come with me, Lizzie
And the stars will write your name
And if you still think I'm lying to you
Look yonder
There comes the rain

[Chorus]
Step back, non-believers
Or the rain will never come
Someone keep that fire a-burning
Somebody beat the drum
He said some may think I'm crazy
For making all these claims
But I swear before this day is over
You folks are gonna see some rain
Step back, non-believers

Tanya Tucker,Ready As I’ll Never Be,"[Verse 1]
I felt you callin'
I saw you start
From the old town movies to the bars on the boulevard
The bells were ringin'
For a gypsy soul
Straight to the smart-mouthed little girl from Seminole
All you outlaws
And the Opry queens
They wrapped those golden arms around the baby of the family
To stand beside you then
Was more than enough
I always was and always will be lookin' up

[Chorus]
So gather 'round now, it's time to sing
It's bittersweet, but it's a hell of a silver lining
I tell the same ol' stories, y'all get your wings
And I get better every time I kiss a weathered cheek
And watchin' doves fly sooner than me
I guess I'm ready, ready as I'll never be

[Verse 2]
The snow don't fall on Willcox
And the whippoorwill don't lie
Are the two things you can count on
And if you blink, you're gonna miss it twice
Even if I saw it comin'
Even if I wanted to
You're just goin' to the one place left
That I can't follow you

[Chorus]
So gather 'round now, it's time to sing
It's bittersweet, but it's a hell of a silver lining
I tell the same ol' stories, y'all get your wings
And I get better every time, but I don't know

[Bridge]
Ain't no debts to repay
Even if you're light years away
May the circle be unbroken
Let it breathe through you
One sweet day (Day)
Whoa, happy days

[Chorus]
Gather 'round now, it's time to sing
It's bittersweet, but it's a hell of a silver lining
I tell the same ol' stories, y'all get your wings
And I get better every time I kiss a weathered cheek
And watchin' doves fly sooner than me
I guess I'm ready, ready as I'll never be

[Outro]
I'm ready as I'll never be"
Tanya Tucker,"I’m the Singer, You’re the Song","I'm the singer, you're the song
You write the words, I'll sing along
We're gonna make it to the top, and maybe we won't stop
I know we're young, but boy we're strong

I'm the stars, you're the sky
Close together we'll get by
We won't hear a word they say, no, we'll just do it our way
And I know we'll show 'em all someday

So I say come and love me now
If I don't know, then you can show me how
And I say be my love tonight
It feels so good I know it must be right
It's just gotta be right

Is this a dream, is this for real
They'll never know how high I feel
Ain't had much time to look around, but I know I've found
A place in space where I belong

I'm the singer, you're the song

So I say come and love me now
If I don't know, then you can show me how
And I say be my love tonight
It feels so good I know it must be right
It's just gotta be right

So I say come and love me now
If I don't know, then you can show me how
And I say be my love tonight
It feels so good I know it must be right
Oh, it's just gotta be right

I'm the singer you're the song"
Tanya Tucker,Blood Red and Going Down,"[Chorus]
That Georgia sun
Was blood red and goin' down
That Georgia sun
Was blood red and goin' down

[Verse 1]
Daddy said
Now come, girl
We're headed down the road to Augusta
And thinking through his clenched teeth
He called Mama's name
Then he cussed her
He said
Girl, you're young
But some dude has come along
And stole your mother
Aw, but you can't steal a willing mind
Whose mama's always looking for a lover

[Chorus]
That Georgia sun
Was blood red and goin' down
That Georgia sun
Was blood red and goin' down

[Verse 2]
With dusty teardrops on his face
My daddy cried
And big steps he was taking
And halfway running to keep up
My shorter legs were so tired and shaking
Where did I go wrong, girl?
Why would she leave us both this way?
At times like these
A child of ten never knows exactly what to say

[Chorus]
That Georgia sun
Was blood red and goin' down
That Georgia sun
Was blood red and goin' down

[Verse 3]
We searched in every bar room
And honky-tonk as well
And finally, Daddy found them
But Lord, you know the rest is hard to tell
He sent me out to wait
But scared I looked back through the door
And Daddy left them both
Sucking up the sawdust on the floor

[Chorus]
That Georgia sun
Was blood red and goin' down
That Georgia sun
Was blood red and goin' down
That Georgia sun
Was blood red and goin' down
That Georgia sun
Was blood red and goin' down"
Tanya Tucker,The House That Built Me,"[Verse 1]
I know they say you can't go home again
I just had to come back one last time
Ma'am, I know you don't know me from Adam
But these handprints on the front steps are mine
Up those stairs, in that little back bedroom
Is where they did their homework and learned to play guitar
And I bet you didn't know underneath that live oak
My favorite dog is buried in the yard

[Chorus]
I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here it's like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself
If I could just come in, I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me

[Verse 2]
I cut out pictures of houses for years
From Better Homes and Garden magazines
Plans were drawn and concrete poured
Nail by nail and board by board
But once the kids were grown, it was just too much for me

[Chorus]
I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here it's like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself again
If I could just come in, I swear I'll leave
I won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me

[Bridge]
They leave home, they move on, and you do the best you can
I got lost in this ol' world and forgot who I am

[Chorus]
I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here it's like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself
Ma'am, if I could walk around, I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me"
Tanya Tucker,Rainy Girl,"Maybe you wish I was someone else
I've tried so hard to be myself
But I can see you need a change
Some folks get tired of the rain
Some folks get tired of the rain

One sunny day you'll change your mind
And look for clouds but you find
Your rainy girl won't rain no more
Some folks get tired of the rain
Some folks get tired of the rain

Hope you find those sunny days
As bright as you thought they would be
Remember who wanted what a change
It was you babe, not me

My love will last forever more
Just like the rain my love will pour
And when you go I'll love again
Some folks don't tire of the rain
Some folks don't tire of the rain
Some folks get tired of the rain"
Tanya Tucker,Love Me Like You Used To,"[Verse 1]
In a cozy little restaurant for lovers
It seems so out of place for you and me
We used to play around under the covers
But now it's just a place to watch TV

[Chorus]
So love me like you used to when our love was brand new
And darlin' when we're through you can love me again
And hold me like you want to instead of like you have to
Love me like you used to love me when you used to love me

[Verse 2]
Baby, we could use a long vacation
But the trouble here is bound to tag along
We used to be each other's inspiration
When it only took my touch to turn you on

[Chorus]
So love me like you used to when our love was brand new
And darlin' when we're through you can love me again
And hold me like you want to instead of like you have to
Love me like you used to love me when you used to love me

[Bridge]
Well we used to sit and talk about forever
But now we hardly ever talk at all
We walked a lot of tight ropes together
We always caught each other when we'd fall

[Chorus]
So love me like you used to when our love was brand new
And darlin' when we're through you can love me again
And hold me like you want to instead of like you have to
Love me like you used to love me when you used to love me

[Outro]
Darling, love me like you used to when you used to love me"
Tanya Tucker,Down to My Last Teardrop,"""They said your love life's in trouble in a magazine I read
When the one you love is hangin' off of his side of the bed
Baby, you're just barely hangin' on
Honey I know you'll soon be gone

And I don't need my palm read to know what lies ahead
I can see you in the arms of another girl instead
Baby this ain't the first time you've done it to me
Honey it's gonna be the last time

And I know you think that I'll be goin' out of my mind
Crying you a river that winds and winds and winds
Oh but baby I'm down to my last teardrop this time

I don't care who or what you're doin'
Ain't gonna be no more boohooin'
Baby this time I swear it's the truth
I ain't gonna cry no more for you
Uh-uh

Now I know where I'm goin' baby I know where I'm bound
I've been rearranging chairs on a ship that's goin' down
Baby, just step aside if you would
Honey, it's really over for good

And you might want to talk to me, you might want to call
But you won't hear nothin' out of me at all
Cause Baby, I ain't got nothin' left to say
Honey, I'll just be on my way

And I know you think that I'll be goin' out of my mind
Crying you a river that winds and winds and winds
Oh but baby I'm down to my last teardrop this time

I don't care who or what you're doin'
Ain't gonna be no more boohooin'
Baby this time I swear it's the truth
I ain't gonna cry no more for you

And I know you that I'll be goin' out of my mind
Crying you a river that winds and winds and winds
Oh but baby I'm down to my last teardrop
Baby I'm down to my last teardrop
Baby I'm down to my last teardrop this time"""
Charlie Daniels,The Devil Went Down to Georgia,"[Verse 1]
The Devil went down to Georgia
He was lookin' for a soul to steal
He was in a bind 'cause he was way behind
And he was willing to make a deal
When he came across this young man
Sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the Devil jumped up on a hickory stump
And said ""Boy, let me tell you what""

[Verse 2]
""I guess you didn't know it, but I am a fiddle player too
And if you'd care to take a dare, I'll make a bet with you
Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy, but give the Devil his due
I'll bet a fiddle o' gold against your soul 'cause I think I'm better than you""
The boy said, ""My name's Johnny, and it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet and you're gonna regret 'cause I'm the best there's ever been""

[Bridge]
Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard
'Cause Hell's broke loose in Georgia and the Devil deals the cards
And if you win, you get this shiny fiddle made of gold
But if you lose the devil gets your soul

[Verse 3]
The Devil opened up his case and he said, ""I'll start this show""
And fire flew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow
And he pulled the bow across the strings and it made a evil hiss
And then a band of demons joined in and it sounded something like this

[Fiddle Solo]

[Verse 3]
When the Devil finished, Johnny said
""Well, you're pretty good ol' son
But sit down in that chair right there
And let me show you how it's done""

[Chorus]
""Fire on the Mountain,"" run, boys, run
The Devil's in the house of the risin' sun
Chicken in the bread pan pickin' out dough
Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no

[Fiddle Solo]

[Verse 4]
The Devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnny's feet
Johnny said, ""Devil, just come on back if you ever wanna try again
I done told you once, you son of a bitch, I'm the best there's ever been""

[Chorus]
He played ""Fire on the Mountain,"" run, boys, run
The Devil's in the house of the risin' sun
The chicken in the bread pan pickin' out dough
Granny, will your dog bite? No, child, no"
Charlie Daniels,Uneasy Rider,"[Verse]
I was taking a trip out to L.A.​
Tooling along in my Chevrolet
Tokin’ on a number and diggin' on the radio
Just as I crossed the Mississippi line
I heard that highway start to whine
And I knew that left rear tire was about to go
Well the spare was flat and I got uptight
'Cause there wasn't a filling station in sight
So I just limped on down the shoulder on the rim
I went as far as I could, and when I stopped the car
It was right in front of this little bar
Kind of a redneck-lookin' joint called the Dew Drop Inn
Well, I stuffed my hair up under my hat
And told the bartender that I had a flat
And would he be kind enough to give me change for a one?
There was one thing I was sure proud to see
There wasn't a soul in the place except for him and me
He just looked disgusted and pointed toward the telephone
I called up a station down the road a ways
And he said he wasn't very busy today
And he could have someone there in just about 10 minutes or so
He said, ""Now, you just stay right where yer at!""
And I didn't bother to tell the darn fool
That I sure as hell didn't have anyplace else to go
I just ordered up a beer and sat down at the bar
When some guy walked in and said, ""Who owns this car
With the peace sign, and the mag wheels, and four on the floor?""
Well, he looked at me and I damn near died
And I decided that I'd just wait outside
So I laid a dollar on the bar and headed for the door
Just when I thought I'd get out of there with my skin
These five big dudes come strollin' in
With this one old drunk chick and some fella with green teeth
And I was almost to the door, when the biggest one
Said, ""You tip your hat to this lady son!""
And when I did, all that hair fell out from underneath
Now the last thing I wanted was to get into a fight
In Jackson Mississippi on a Saturday night
Especially when there was three of them and only one of me
But they all started laughing, and I felt kinda sick
And I knew I better think of something pretty quick
So I just reached out and kicked ol' green teeth right in the knee
Now he let out a yell that'd curl your hair
But before he could move I grabbed me a chair
And said, ""Watch him folks 'cause he's a thoroughly dangerous man!""
""You may not know it but this man is a spy
He's a undercover agent for the FBI
And he's been sent down here to infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan!""
He was still bent over holding on to his knee
But everybody else was looking and listening to me
And I laid it on thicker and heavier as I went
I said, ""Would you believe this man has gone as far
As tearing Wallace stickers off the bumpers of cars
And he voted for George McGovern for President""
""Well, he's a friend of them long haired hippy-type, pinko fags!
I bet you he's even got a commie flag
Tacked up on the wall inside of his garage""
""He's a snake in the grass, I tell you guys
He may look dumb but that's just a disguise
He's a mastermind in the ways of espionage""
They all started looking real suspicious at him
And he jumped up and said, ""Now just wait a minute Jim!
You know he's lying, I been living here all of my life!""
""I'm a faithful follower of Brother John Birch
And I belong to the Antioch Baptist Church
And I ain't even got a garage, you can call home and ask my wife!""
Then he started saying something 'bout the way I was dressed
But I didn't wait around to hear the rest
I was too busy moving and hoping I didn't run out of luck
And when I hit the ground I was making tracks
And they were just taking my car down off the jacks
So I threw the man a twenty and jumped in and fired that mother up
Mario Andretti would have be sure been proud
Of the way I was moving when I passed that crowd
Coming out the door and headed toward me in a trot
And I guess I should've gone ahead and run
But somehow I just couldn't resist the fun
Of chasing them all just once around the parking lot
Well, they headed for their car, but I hit the gas
And spun around and headed them off at the pass
I was slinging gravel and putting a ton of dust in the air
I had them all out there stepping and fetching
Like their heads were on fire and their asses was catching
But I figured I had better go ahead and split before the cops got there
When I hit the road I was really wheeling
Had gravel flying and rubber squealing
And I didn't slow down 'til I was almost to Arkansas
Well, I think I'm going to reroute my trip
I wonder if anybody'd think I'd flipped
If I went to L.A. via Omaha"
Charlie Daniels,Simple Man,"[Verse 1]
I ain't nothin' but a simple man
They call me a redneck I reckon that I am
But there's things goin' on that make me mad down to the core
I have to work like a dog to make ends meet
There's crooked politicians and crime in the street
And I'm madder than hell, and I ain't a-gonna take it no more

[Verse 2]
We tell our kids, ""Just say no""
And then some panty-waist judge lets a drug dealer go
He slaps him on the wrist and he turns him back out on the town
But if I had my way with people sellin' dope
Take a big tall tree and a short piece of rope
I'd hang 'em up high and let 'em swing 'til the sun goes down

[Chorus]
Well, you know what's wrong with the world today
People done gone and put their Bibles away
They're livin' by the law of the jungle not the law of the land
Well, the Good Book says it so I know it's the truth
An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
You better watch where you go and remember where you been
That's the way I see it, I'm a simple man

[Verse 3]
Now I'm the kinda man wouldn't harm a mouse
But if I catch somebody breakin' in my house
I got twelve-gauge shotgun waitin' on the other side
So don't go pushin' me against my will
I don't want to have to fight you but I dern sure will
If you don't want trouble then you'd better just pass me on by

[Verse 4]
As far as I'm concerned there ain't no excuse
For the rapin' and the killin' and the child abuse
But I got a way to put an end to all that fast
You just take them rascals out in the swamp
Put 'em on their knees and tie 'em to a stump
Let the rattlers and the bugs and the alligators do the rest

[Chorus]
Well, you know what's wrong with the world today
People done gone and put their Bibles away
They're livin' by the law of the jungle not the law of the land
Well, the Good Book says it so I know it's the truth
An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
You better watch where you go and remember where you been
That's the way I see it, I'm a simple man

[Outro]
Watch where you go and remember where you been
That's the way I see it, I'm a simple man"
Charlie Daniels,The South’s Gonna’ Do It Again,"[Verse 1]
Well the train to Grinderswitch is runnin' right on time
And the Tucker boys are cookin' down in Caroline
People down in Florida can't be still
When old Lynyrd Skynyrd's pickin' down in Jacksonville
People down in Georgia come from near and far
To hear Richard Betts pickin' on that red guitar

[Refrain]
So gather 'round, gather 'round children
Get down, well just get down children
Get loud, well you can be loud and be proud
And you can be proud here
And I'll be proud to a rebel 'cause South's gonna do it again
And again

[Verse 2]
Elvin Bishop's sittin' on a bale of hay
He ain't good lookin' but he sure can play
And there's ZZ Top and you can't forget
That old brother Willie's gettin' soakin' wet
And all the good people down in Tennessee
Are diggin' Barefoot Jerry and the C.D.B

[Refrain]
Well gather 'round, gather 'round children
Get down, well you can get down children
Get loud, well you can get loud and be proud
Well you can be proud here
Be proud to a rebel 'cause South's gonna do it again
Yes it is"
Charlie Daniels,Long Haired Country Boy,"[Verse 1]
People say I'm no good
And crazy as a loon
'Cause I get stoned in the mornin'
I get drunk in the afternoon
Kinda like my old blue tick hound
I like to lay around in the shade
And I ain't got no money
But I damn sure got it made

[Chorus]
'Cause I ain't askin' nobody for nothin'
If I can't get it on my own
If you don't like the way I'm livin'
You just leave this long haired country boy alone

[Verse 2]
Preacher man talkin' on TV
Puttin' down the rock and roll
Wants me to send a donation
'Cause he's worried about my soul
He said, ""Jesus walked on the water.""
And I know that it's true
But sometimes I think that preacher man
Would like to do a little walkin' too

[Chorus]
But I ain't askin' nobody for nothin'
If I can't get it on my own
If you don't like the way I'm livin'
You just leave this long haired country boy alone

[Verse 3]
A poor girl wants to marry
And a rich girl wants to flirt
A rich man goes to college
And a poor man goes to work
A drunkard wants another drink of wine
And a politician wants your vote
I don't want much of nothin' at all
But I will take another toke

[Chorus]
But I ain't askin' nobody for nothin'
If I can't get it on my own
If you don't like the way I'm livin'
You just leave this long haired country boy alone"
Charlie Daniels,The Legend Of Wooley Swamp,"[Verse 1]
If you ever go back into Wooley Swamp son you better not go at night
There's things out there in the middle of them woods
That'd make a strong man die from fright
There's things that crawl and things that fly
And things that creep around on the ground
And they say the ghost of Lucius Clay gets up and it walks around

[Chorus]
But I couldn't believe it, I just had to find out for myself
And I couldn't conceive it, I never would listen to nobody else
No I couldn't believe it, I just had to find out for myself
That there's some things in this world you just can't explain

[Verse 2]
The old man lived in the Wooley Swamp way back in the gurgling woods
And he never did do a lot of harm in the world
But he never did do no good
People didn't think too much of him
They all thought he acted funny
The old man didn't care about people anyway
All he cared about was his money
He'd stuff it all down into Mason jars and bury it all around
And on certain nights if the moon was right
He'd dig it up out of the ground
He'd pour it all out on the floor of his shack
And run his fingers through it
Yeah, Lucius Clay was a greedy old man
And that's all there ever was to it

[Chorus]
But I couldn't believe it, I just had to find out for myself
And I couldn't conceive it, I never would listen to nobody else
No I couldn't believe it, I just had to find out for myself
That there's some things in this world you just can't explain

[Verse 3]
The Crayton boys was white trash
And they lived over on Parvis Creek
They were a real snake and sneaky as a cat
And belligerent when they'd speak
One night the oldest brother said ya'll meet in the Wooley Swamp later
We'll get old Lucius' money and we'll pitch him to the alligators
They found the old man out in the back with a shovel in his hand
And thirteen rusty Mason jars he just dug up out of the sand
And they all went crazy and they beat the old man
Then they picked him up off the ground
Then they threw him in the swamp and they stood there and laughed
As the black water sucked him down
Then they turned around and went back to the shack
And they picked up the money and ran
But they hadn't gone nowhere when they realized
They were running in quicksand
And they struggled and screamed but they couldn't get away
Then just before they went under
They could hear that old man laughing
In a voice that was loud as thunder

[Bridge]
Now that's been fifty years ago an' if you go back by there again
There's a spot in the yard in back of that shack
Where the ground is always wet
And on certain nights if the moon is right
And you're down by the dark footpath
You can hear three young men screaming
And you can hear that old man laugh

[Chorus]
But I couldn't believe it, I just had to find out for myself
And I couldn't conceive it, I never would listen to nobody else
No I couldn't believe it, I just had to find out for myself
That there's some things in this world you just can't explain"
Charlie Daniels,In America,"[Verse 1]
Well the eagle's been flying slow
And the flag's been flying low
And a lot of people saying that America's fixing to fall
Well speaking just for me
And some people from Tennessee
We've got a thing or two to tell you all
This lady may have stumbled
But she ain't never fell
And if the Russians don't believe that
They can all go straight to hell
We're gonna put her feet back
On the path of righteousness and then
God bless America again

[Chorus]
And you never did think
That it ever would happen again (In America, did you?)
You never did think
That we'd ever get together again
(We damn sure fooled you)
Yeah, we're walking real proud
And we're talking real loud again (In America)
You never did think
That it ever would happen again

[Verse 2]
From The Sound up in Long Island
Out to San Francisco Bay
And everything that's in between them is our own
And we may have done a little bit
Of fighting among ourselves
But you outside people best leave us alone
Cause we'll all stick together
And you can take that to the bank
That's the cowboys and the hippies
And the rebels and the yanks
You just go and lay your hand
On a Pittsburgh Steelers fan
And I think you're gonna finally understand

[Chorus][x2]"
Charlie Daniels,Uneasy Rider ’88,"[Verse]
Me and my buddy got us a wild hair
And figured we wanted to go somewhere
So we loaded up in my ragtop Chevrolet
We had a little bit of money and a whole lot of show
And with Hank Jr. blarin' on the radio
We got us a tank full of gas and we was on our way
We figured we'd go down to New Orleans
We were barrelin' down old 17
When a man with a blinking red light was on our tail
He said you were doing sixty in a fourty-five
But I'm gonna let you go this time
But if I catch you again, I'm gonna slap you in the county jail
We said ""Thank you, sir, you sure been nice
And you ain't gonna have to tell us twice""
And we were southbound and down with the wind blowin' in our faces
We kept on rolling, and pretty soon
The radio was cookin' out a Haggard tune
And we were pullin' into Houston and checkin' out all them places
I was feelin' dry and I said ""I think we ought to stop and get ourselves a drink""
And old Jim said ""Yeah, 'cause we got time to kill""
We kept on rollin' and I seen this spot
And we pulled into the parking lot
Of this place called the ""Cloud Nine Bar and Grill""
We walked through the door, and the place was jammed
The lights were low, they had a punk rock band
And some orange haired fella singin' about suicide
I said ""Jim, this ain't our kind of place""
He said ""Well, let's just have one round anyway""
So against my better judgement we walked on inside
Went up to the bar and we sat down
This fella walked up and said ""I'll buy this round""
And he sat down on the bar stool next to Jim
He looked like a girl, but he talked like a guy
He had lipstick on and mascara in his eyes
And everybody in that place looked just about like him
I said ""Jim, this ain't our kind of bar""
Let's just go on out and get back in the car
'Cause there's gonna be trouble
Ain't no sense in taking a chance
We was gettin' up, gettin' ready to leave
Somebody grabbed old Jim by the sleeve
Was this good looking girl, she was asking my buddy to dance
I said ""Jim, don't do it, there's somethin' missin'""
There's fellas dancin' and fellas kissin'
There's a fella in high-heeled shoes wearin' panty hose
He said ""Partner, I just can't turn this down
You just go over there and have one more round
I'll dance with the lady, and we'll get on down the road""
So he walked away and left me alone
And this funny looking fella kept comin' on
And he was makin' me mad with some of the things he said
And then he put his hand on my knee
I said ""If you don't get your paw off me
I'm gonna locate your nose around on the side of your head""
He said ""I love it when you get that fire in your eye""
I said ""Well, partner, try this on for size""
And I unloaded on him and he went out like a light
Everybody in that place must have been his friend
They all headed for me, I said ""This is the end""
But where I come from we don't give up without a fight
They were screamin' and yellin' and scratchin' and clawin'
I was punchin' and hittin' and kickin' and pawin'
I was holdin' my own 'cause I've been in a scrap or two
Old Jim come runnin' up out of the blue
And that gal he was with come runnin' up too
And proceeded to beat on me with a high heel shoe
I grabbed her by the hair, it come off in my hand
And that beautiful girl was just a beautiful man
Old Jim just got sick right there on the floor
He dropped that dude like a shot from a gun
Smeared his lipstick, made his makeup run
And me and old Jim started fightin' our way to the door
Man, we lit out of there in that Chevrolet
And I put in on the floor and she stayed that way
We was goin' down the highway doing 'bout a hundred and ten
We was headed for home and we was gettin' nearer
Then a red light came on the rear-view mirror
And that same blame cop was pullin' us over again
Well, I'm sittin' here in this county jail
I had to call my daddy to go our bail
But I learned me a lesson that I never will forget again
I done give up drinking, I've give up bars
And runnin' around the country in souped up cars
I'm goin' back where the women are women and the men are men"
Charlie Daniels,Still in Saigon,"[Verse 1]
Got on a plane in 'Frisco
And got off in Vietnam
I walked into a different world
The past forever gone
I could have gone to Canada
Or I could have stayed in school
But I was brought up differently
I couldn't break the rules
Thirteen months and fifteen days
The last ones were the worst
One minute I'd kneel down and pray
And the next I'd stand and curse
No place to run to
Where I did not feel that war
When I got home I stayed alone
And checked behind each door

[Chorus]
Because I'm still in Saigon
Still in Saigon
I am still in Saigon
In my mind

[Verse 2]
The ground at home was covered in snow
And I was covered in sweat
My younger brother calls me a killer
And my daddy calls me a vet
Everybody says I'm someone else
And I'm sick and there's no cure
Damned if I know who I am
There was only one place I was sure

[Chorus]
Because I'm still in Saigon
Still in Saigon
I am still in Saigon
In my mind

[Verse 3]
Every summer when it rains
I smell the jungle, I hear the planes
I can't tell no one, I feel ashamed
Afraid some day I'll go insane
That's been ten long years ago
And time has gone on by
Now and then I catch myself
Eyes searching through the sky
All the sounds of long ago
Will be forever in my head
Mingled with the wounded cries
And the silence of the dead

[Chorus]
Because I'm still in Saigon
Still in Saigon
I am still in Saigon
In my mind

[Chorus]
Because I'm still in Saigon
Still in Saigon
I am still in Saigon
In my mind"
Charlie Daniels,Trudy (1974),"[Chorus]
Call up Trudy on the telephone
Send her a letter in the mail
Tell her I'm hung up here in Dallas
They won't let me out of this jail
And if she asks you how I'm fairing
Tell her I'm just about to lose my mind
Worried about old Johnny Lee Walker
And the girl I left behind

[Verse 1]
Now John Lee Walker was a card mechanic
Had a hand for trouble and a eye for cash
Luckiest man in Dallas County
He had a gold watch chain and a black mustache
And he loved his whiskey and he loved his women
Drove a big long Cadillac limousine
Kept a big, fine, fancy townhouse in Dallas
And a hotel suite in New Orleans
Carried a switchblade knife in his left hip pocket
And a .44 hog leg up under his coat
Cut you down in a New York minute
If he catch you cheating, that was all she wrote

[Chorus]
So call up Trudy on the telephone
Send her a letter in the mail
Tell her I'm hung up here in Dallas
They won't let me out of this jail
And if she asks you how I'm fairing
Tell her I'm just about to lose my mind
Worried about old Johnny Lee Walker
And the girl I left behind

[Verse 2]
I just got to town last Friday evening
Sure as hell didn't mean to stay
I was on my way back to Louisiana
Had a powerful thirst and six months pay
I met a peroxide blonde in a bar on Deep Elm
I was flying high and feeling mean
Poured down a bottle and a half of Red Eye
I dropped thirty-five dollars in the slot machine
And the boys in the back was a-dealing seven card
I sat down and won me a hundred and ten
I was raking in chips like Grant took Richmond
'Til big John Lee come a-strolling in
He ripped off the table like a 707
Pretty soon, he done won all of my bread
I accused him of cheating, he reached for a pistol
I grabbed a chair and went upside of his head
Then I took off a-running like a motorcycle
Heard the bullets whining and the sirens wail
But it took half the cops in Dallas County
Just to put one coon-ass boy in jail

[Chorus]
So call up Trudy on the telephone
Send her a letter in the mail
Tell her I'm hung up here in Dallas
And they won't let me out of this jail
And if she asks you how I'm fairing
Tell her I'm just about to lose my mind
Worried about old Johnny Lee Walker
And the girl I left behind
Call up Trudy on the telephone
Send her a letter in the mail
Tell her I'm hung up here in Dallas
They won't let me out of this jail
And if she asks you how I'm fairing
Tell her I'm just about to lose my mind
Worried about old Johnny Lee Walker
And the girl I left behind

[Outro]
Now call up Trudy on the telephone
Send her a letter in the mail, a letter in the mail"
Charlie Daniels,(What This World Needs Is) A Few More Rednecks,"[Chorus]
What this world needs is a few more rednecks
Some people ain't afraid to take a stand
What this world needs is a little more respect
For the Lord and the law and the working man
We could use a little peace and satisfaction
Some good people up front to take the lead
A little less talk and a little more action
And a few more rednecks is what we need

[Verse 1]
I was raised on beans and cornbread
And I like my chicken fried
Yes, I drive a pick-up truck
And I'm full of American pride
I keep a Bible on my table
I got a flag out on my lawn
And I don't believe in minding
No one's business but my own
And I love them Rambo movies
I think they make a lot of sense
And it's a shame old John Wayne
Didn't live to run for president
And I don't care what nobody says
I don't trust old Gorbachev
And I don't know who turned him on
But it's time to turn him off

[Chorus]
What this world needs is a few more rednecks
Some people ain't afraid to take a stand
What this world needs is a little more respect
For the Lord and the law and the working man
We could use a little peace and satisfaction
Some good people up front to take the lead
A little less talk and a little more action
And a few more rednecks is what we need

[Verse 2]
Now they're trying to take my guns away
And that would be just fine
If you take them away from the criminals first
I'll gladly give you mine
And I don't mind paying taxes
But it makes my temper itch
When my hard earned money goes
To make some politician rich
What most people call a redneck
Ain't nothing but a working man
And he makes his living
By the sweat of his brow
And the calluses on his hands
Now you intellectuals may not like it
But there ain't nothing that you can do
Cause there's a whole lot more of us common-folks
Then there ever will be of you

[Chorus]
What this world needs is a few more rednecks
Some people ain't afraid to take a stand
What this world needs is a little more respect
For the Lord and the law and the working man
We could use a little peace and satisfaction
Some good people up front to take the lead
A little less talk and a little more action
And a few more rednecks is what we need

[Outro]
That's what we need
And a few more rednecks is what we need"
Charlie Daniels,Drinking My Baby Goodbye,"[Chorus]
Sitting on a barstool acting like a darn fool
That's what I'm a-doing today
Sitting here drinking trying to keep from thinking
I'm a boozing my troubles away
Well now I couldn't make her stay, well doggone her anyway
She can't say that I didn't try
Pour me another one, I'm finished with the other one
I'm drinking my baby goodbye

[Verse 1]
Every time we disagreed
She was always asking me
Are you a man or a mouse?
Now that she's gone
She probably thinks I'm home
Just a moping around the house
She probably thinks that she's the one thing
I just couldn't get along without
Well wouldn't it surprise her I got a sympathizer
As long as these bottles hold out

[Chorus]
Sitting on a barstool acting like a darn fool
That's what I'm a-doing today
Sitting here drinking trying to keep from thinking
I'm a boozing my troubles away
Well now I couldn't make her stay, well doggone her anyway
She can't say that I didn't try
Pour me another one, I'm finished with the other one
I'm drinking my baby goodbye

[Verse 2]
Every time I try to sit down and talk to her
It always ends up in a fuss
I tried to reason with her right up to the time
She got on that Greyhound bus
It would be better if I could forget her
Because she sure forgot about me
And if takes all night I'm going to do it right
I'm going to sit here till I can't see

[Chorus]
Sitting on a barstool acting like a darn fool
That's what I'm a-doing today
Sitting here drinking trying to keep from thinking
I'm a boozing my troubles away
Well now I couldn't make her stay, well doggone her anyway
She can't say that I didn't try
Pour me another one, I'm finished with the other one
I'm drinking my baby goodbye"

Charlie Daniels,Stroker’s Theme,"[Verse 1]
Stroker Ace was born to race
He had a mean streak ten feet wide
A son-of-a-gun with a taste for fun
And more than his share of pride
Take a dirt road curve with the Devil's nerve
And make a car dance across the mud
Hauling 'shine was his regular line 'til the
Track got in his blood
Was a real hotshot and he bragged a lot
But man, that fool could drive
'Cause he loved the feel of the steering wheel
And the girls with the bedroom eyes
And in a racing tide or a bar room fight old Stroker stole the show
A back stretch blazer, a real hellraiser and a race track Romeo

[Bridge]
Mama lock your daughters up
That wild bunch is back in town
And them little girls get frisky
When they hear that racecar sound
They're bringin out the yellow flag
Somebody's brakes have failed
There's an oilslick on the inside
And a wreck along the rail
You better stand on it, Stroker
Cause a bandit's on your tail

[Verse 2]
It's a downright joy for a country boy
When he hears them engines moan
But you gotta hang tough and it gets real rough
When you're out there on your own
Cause they'll push you around, they'll knock you down
They'll shove ya up against the wall
And you always know when your engine blows
That a man can't win 'em all
You could push that car just a little too far any Sunday afternoon
And if you break your neck In some damn fool wreck they forget about you soon
But old Stroker Ace was born to race
And it's worth all the trying
Just to drink champagne in the Victory Lane
And to hear that concrete whine

[Bridge]
Stroker get your dander up
This ain't no time to lag
You've got to make a lap up
If you gonna to take that checkered flag
Number ten is closin' in to even up the score
It's time to wave bye-bye and put the pedal on the floor
You better stand on it Stroker
Cause you're blowin' off their doors

[Outro]
Blow their doors off, Stroker
Stand on it, Son
Ah, you good lookin' devil, you"
Charlie Daniels,Was It 26,"[Verse 1]
Living hard was easy when I was young and bullet proof
I had no chains to bind me, just a guitar and a roof
Emptied every bottle, when I poured I never missed
I had bloodshot eyes at 25, or was it 26?
It didn't seem to matter what price I had to pay
Because anything worth having I'd just lose anyway
Friends worried about me and they asked if I was sick
Thought I would die at 25, or was it 26?

[Chorus]
Those two years run together like whiskey over ice
Melting into memories like somebody else's life
I'm glad to say I've come around but if I could have one wish
I'd like another try at 25, or was it 26?

[Verse 2]
I met a girl from Georgia, smart and pretty college grad
I thought my luck was changing up till then it'd all been bad
Guess I fell in love with her, all it took was just one kiss
But she said goodbye at 25, or was it 26?

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I've been down that road before almost as far as hell
Deception or redemption I guess only time will tell
I have faith in the knowledge that God gave us a gift
I couldn't hide at 25, or was it 26?

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I'd like another try at 25, or was it 26?"
Charlie Daniels,Alligator,"Well, ol' Catahoula Brown lived back in the swamp
With his dogs and a bunch of sons
One teenage daughter, her name was Sally Sue
She was as pretty as a newborn fawn

And he didn't like sinners, and he didn't like saints
And he didn't like anything
But as much as he disliked everybody else
He just hated ol' Silas Green

Sally Sue come in on a Saturday evening
As the sun was going down
She said, ""Papa, if it's alright with you
Well, I think I'm gonna go to town.""

He said, ""Daughter, you get on back in the house
'cause you ain't going no place
'til you get them ribbons out of your hair
And wash the makeup off of your face.""

She said, ""Papa, don't you be so hard on me
'cause I just got a date
With this boy I met in Sunday school
And we ain't gonna be out late.""

And then she walked on up to the rural route
And she caught herself a ride
But it wasn't no boy from Sunday school
That was sittin' on the other side

It was Silas Green's youngest son Bobby Joe
Sittin' under that steering wheel

(Chorus):
Alligator! Alligator! Swimming in the stream
Alligator! Alligator! What makes you so mean?
Alligator! Alligator! Wonder where you been

And did you swallow ol' Catahoula Brown?
I ain't never seen him again

Catahoula got up on Sunday morning
Made some coffee and had him a cup
Then he walked on out to the back of the house
To get his pretty daughter up

He went running in the room where the boys all slept
Hollered, ""Get up! Somethin' ain't right
And I'm worried to death 'cause your darling little sister
Didn't even come home last night.""

Johnny said, ""Papa, don't be mad at me
I sure hate to tell you this
But I seen her in the town with Bobby Joe Green
And I even seen her give him a kiss.""

""And I tried to get her to come on back
But she told me to leave her alone
She said they were getting married before the sun come up
And she wasn't NEVER coming home.""

Catahoula grabbed the boy by the nape of his neck
And slapped him upside the head
He said, ""Before I see her married to that trash
I'd rather see the little girl dead!""

And then he whistled up his dogs, and he grabbed his gun
And he was full of evil and fight
He went a-runnin' 'cross the woods hollering
""Silas Green and his bunch are gonna die tonight!""

Then a day went by and he didn't come back
And another went by, then a week
And when the boys went looking, all they found was his shotgun
Laying at the bottom of the creek

And then they found his boots, and they found his cap
But they couldn't find anything else
Except a big bad alligator, sitting on a log
Looking mighty proud of himself

It don't pay to hate somebody so bad you go
Stomping around in gator country

(Repeat Chorus)

Well, did you swallow ol' Catahoula Brown?
I ain't never seen him again.."
Charlie Daniels,Georgia (1974),"[Verse 1]
Lamps in the windows burning bright, over in Santa Fe tonight
Full moon shining down along the border
But the ground is hard and the night is black
Over here by the rail-road track
And I wish to the Lord that I was back in Georgia

[Chorus]
Blue water in the evening sun
Calling me when the day is done
Mama, mama pray for your son

[Verse 2]
All of my life I've been told
That the LA streets was paved with gold
Fame and fortune waiting to reward you
But it didn't take long to understand
California ain't the promised land
But at least a man's a man in Georgia

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Well the St. Mary's River in the Georgia moonlight
Flowing under the Folkston Bridge
The sun comes up through the long leaf pine trees
Over 'round the Kingsland ridge
I may be here but my mind is still
About 90 miles north of Jacksonville

[Verse 3]
Well I may not make it, it's a long, long road
But mama I've paid all the debts I owe
And if I don't you know they going to find me trying
They took my songs and they took my soul
They made me hard and they made me old
Hell I just been born, but I feel just like I'm dying

[Chorus]"
Charlie Daniels,Carolina (I Remember You),"The first things I remember are frosty Carolina mornings with a cheery fire
Crackling in my mommas big black wood cook stove

I remember snow flakes as big as goose feathers and the moon the color of new
Made country butter and a night sky like diamonds against black velvet reaching
From horizon to horizon

I remember when the biggest problems in my barefoot life were sand spurs and
Red ant hills

I remember sitting with my grand-daddy on the front porch and watching the last
Of that magnificent southern sun bleed away into the twilight sky

I remember Sunday school and kneeling at the cross and trying to imagine what
God looked like; Sunday dinner, short pants, hair cuts and a little puppy my
Daddy brought home to me and I remember love

I remember steam puffing, fire breathing, awesome 10 wheel locomotives and the
Conductor's watch looked as big as one of my grandmothers biscuits

I remember my mother smiling in a red and white checkered dress and Christmas
Always seemed so far away. Yes, I remember you Carolina, grand old lady of the
South. I remember you as home

One of the memories that stays on my mind
About an old southern lady that I left behind
Is a ramshackle bridge where the deep river winds
And an old two-lane blacktop through the tall long-leaf pines

Carolina, Carolina
You're hard, but you're hard to forget

I still remember the magnolia nights
And goosefeather snow flakes in the gray morning light;
Sandspurs and puppies and red autumn leaves
And the warm lights in the clear night on a cold Christmas Eve

Carolina, Carolina
You're hard, but you're hard to forget

Carolina I knew you
Before the highways got to you
And I loved you as one of your own
And I still do

Carolina, Carolina
You're hard, but you're hard to forget
You're hard To Forget"
Charlie Daniels,Reflections,"[Verse 1]
I remember you back in 1956
You had all the moves and you knew all the tricks
You left all the ladies in a hell of a fix
When your voice took wing
Then you'd shake around and oh, how you'd sing
Just an old boy from Memphis with a big diamond ring
A country girl's prayer and a city girl's dream
Hail the king

[Chorus]
But it's all right now
Keep on singing loud
It's all right now
Heaven should be proud

[Verse 2]
The fifties left town on a crowded dance floor
The sixties came in with a bang and a roar
The world heard a knock, it was Janis at the door
They let her in
And when it seemed this whole world was falling apart
The house lights would fall and the music would start
She'd be giving us all a piece of her heart
Once again

[Chorus]
But it's all right now
Keep on singing loud
It's all right now
Heaven should be proud

[Verse 3]
It was October in St. Louis town
When we heard that the Free Bird had fell to the ground
And we all said a prayer before we went down
To play
And Ronnie, my buddy above all the rest
I miss you the most and I loved you the best
And now that you're gone, I thank God I was blessed
Just to know you

[Chorus]
But it's all right now
Keep on singing loud
It's all right now
Heaven should be proud"
Charlie Daniels,Saddle Tramp,"[Verse]
Well you pass around the pipe
And you all get high
You never even stop and wonder why
Maybe it's because you want to die
Maybe it's just the way things have to be
Well you stay up late
And you drink too damn much whiskey
You know that sort of thing is kind of risky
Maybe it's just because you like to feel frisky
Maybe it's just because you like to feel free

Saddle tramp, how many people watch you riding by?
Like a thunder cloud that floats across the Arizona sky
And wonder if they're looking at a mighty happy man
Or just a lonely breeze
That drifts across the endless desert sand

Well it's getting kinda cold in Readosa
Abilene ain't getting any closer
One more drink, one more hand of poker
Because a fool and his money's going to have to part
You're too proud to ever show your sorrow
You don't steal and you won't beg or borrow
You may be here today but you're gone tomorrow
There ain't no strings
On your boot heels or your heart

Saddle tramp, how many people watch you ride away?
Wonder why you never promise to come back some day
Maybe thinking you were holding
All the pieces in your hand
Or are they slipping through your fingers
Like the endless desert sand?"
Charlie Daniels,Texas,"[Verse]
There's a place not too far away from here
Out with the cows and the Lone Star beer
Where the living and loving is quite all right with me
Well they call it Texas and it's a mighty fine place to be
Runs from Texarkana to El Paso
And Oklahoma down to old Mexico
And there's Houston, Dallas, Austin and San Antone
People in Texas sure do make you feel at home

They just want everybody to leave them alone
While they drink their whiskey and roll their own
And they like their music with a little bit of southern sound
They kick up their heels every evening when the sun goes down
And you can call them country and they don't care
And if you don't like the way they wear their hair
You can take you like and shove 'em on up the line
People in Texas don't care if the sun don't shine"
Charlie Daniels,Falling in Love for the Night,"Well, her name was Maria
She came from [unverified]
She had a passion for diamonds and gold
She done broke every heart
In Flueto bi Arta
By the time she was eighteen years old

Then she left for Las Vegas
With Senor Rodreguez
She didn't care what anybody would think
And when she came back
She had two Cadillacs and a mink

Well, he came from Kentucky
All the boys called him 'Lucky'
He loved to ramble around and have fun
A wild-eyed joker with a talent for poker
And a good lookin' son of a gun

Strong as a bear
Kinda devil may care
But he had a weakness, alright
For good lookin' ladies
And falling in love for the night

He met Maria in a small bar in Mexico City
Where him and his buddies had gone
Down to see the bullfight

He took on look in those flashy brown eyes
And said, ""Here we go again""

When these high powered lovers
Got a look at each other
They thought it was love at first sight
They danced and got high
And then by and by

She came up to his room for the night
Then that high-totin' mama
Left for Yokohana
With a millionaire from San Antone
And when Lucky woke up
His loot and his lady were gone

Now he sits in Louisville drownin'
In sour mash whiskey
While she rides through the streets
Of Juarez in a long limousine

She took his pride
And a whole lot besides
And she just don't give a damn

I guess that's what you get
For fallin' in love for the night
I guess that's what you get
For fallin' in love for the night"
Charlie Daniels,Caballo Diablo,"[Verse 1]
Wild as a coastal boranca, swift as the wind blowing free
With two eyes like fire brands that glow in the night
Somewhere up there he's waiting for me
And he knows that I'm coming for him
I just can't rest until I find
That raven black stallion, who wears no man's brand
With a wild restless spirit like mine

[Chorus]
They call him Caballo Diablo
Half horse and half devil they say
Caballo Diablo the outlaw
Of the blanca Sierra Madre

[Verse 2]
Two men before tried to take him
They had their chance one by one
But each met his fate when those flashing black hooves
Brought death beneath the Mexican sun
Still I can't leave I must find him
You fool of a horse can't you see
I may be half man, but the other half's devil
And you're just exactly like me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Even the breeze has stopped moving
Hush now - be still
Don't make a sound and stay close to the ground
Cause he's waiting just over that hill
Downwind behind him move quickly
Do it fast now, he's starting to stir
Grab a hand full of mane and up onto his back
And start breaking him down with my spurs
But try as he will he can't shake me
As over the preface we go
To spill the life's blood of a horse and a man
On the rocky Sierra below

[Chorus]"
Charlie Daniels,"This Ain’t No Rag, It’s A Flag","This ain't no rag, it's a flag
And we don't wear it on our heads
It's a symbol of the land where the good guys live
Are you listening to what I said
You're a coward and a fool
And you broke all the rules
And you wounded our American pride
And now we're coming with a gun
And you know you're gonna run
But you can't find no place to hide
We're gonna hunt you down like a mad dog hound
Make you pay for the lives you stole
We're all through talking and a-messing around
And now it's time to rock and roll

These colors don't run and we speak as one
When we say united we stand
If you mess with one, you mess with us all
Every boy, girl, woman and man
You've been acting mighty rash
And talking that trash
Let me give you some advice
You could crawl back in your hole
Like a dirty little mole
But now it's time to pay the price
You might've shot us in the back
Now you have to face the fact
That the big boy's in the game
And the thunder's been crashing
And the lightning's been flashing
And now it's getting ready to rain

This is the United States of America
The land of the brave and free
We believe in God, we believe in justice
We believe in liberty
You've been a-pulling our chain
We should've done something 'bout you a long time ago
But now the flag's flying high
And the fur's gonna fly
Soon the whole world's gonna know

This ain't no rag, it's a flag
Old Glory, red, white and blue
The stars and the stripes when it comes to a fight
We could do what we have to do
Our people stand proud
The American crowd is faithful and loyal and tough
We're as good as the best and better than the rest
You're gonna find out soon enough
When you look up in the sky
And you see the eagle fly
You better know he's a-headed your way
This ain't no rag, it's a flag
And it stands for the USA
USA
USA
USA
USA

When you look up in the sky
And you see the eagle fly
You better know he's a-headed your way
'Cause this ain't no rag, it's a flag
And it stands for the USA

I pledge allegiance, to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic, for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all"
Charlie Daniels,Cumberland Mountain Number Nine,"[Verse 1]
Baby don't you cry because momma's coming home
Poppa going bring you back some chitins and some corn
Last frost done took its loss right down to the bone
We're lucky we still got room to roam
Going there to here is almost at a halt
Don't you go off blaming God, you know it ain't his fault
One time when life was fine someone found the wine
Cumberland Mountain Number Nine
That still was the best damn still they ever did make
Wouldn't stand for nothing less, stand for no mistake
Last Fall we made a haul and filled the limestone mine
Cumberland Mountain Number Nine

[Chorus]
Winter come a change
Spring bring the rain
We weren't meant to stay the same
One thing for sure
We done found the cure
Cumberland Mountain Number Nine

[Verse 2]
Black coal from the strip mine way up north at Jellico
Kept the brew running smooth along the Thunder Road
Way back down in Bear Tree Gap the devil's juice flowed fine
Cumberland Mountain Number Nine
The FB- and the TV- I had followed us for years
Eventually they got the scent and nabbed us by the hair
Man said son I'll blow up everything between your ears
You got to face bout 20 years

[Chorus]"
Tim McGraw,Humble and Kind,"[Verse 1]
You know there's a light that glows by the front door
Don't forget the keys under the mat
When childhood stars shine
Always stay humble and kind
Go to church 'cause your momma says to
Visit grandpa every chance that you can
It won't be wasted time
Always stay humble and kind

[Chorus]
Hold the door, say please, say thank you
Don't steal, don't cheat, and don't lie
I know you got mountains to climb but
Always stay humble and kind
When the dreams you're dreamin' come to you
When the work you put in is realized
Let yourself feel the pride but
Always stay humble and kind

[Verse 2]
Don't expect a free ride from no one
Don't hold a grudge or a chip and here's why
Bitterness keeps you from flyin'
Always stay humble and kind
Know the difference between sleepin' with someone
And sleepin' with someone you love
""I love you"" ain't no pickup line, so
Always stay humble and kind

[Chorus]
Hold the door, say please, say thank you
Don't steal, don't cheat, and don't lie
I know you got mountains to climb but
Always stay humble and kind
When those dreams you're dreamin' come to you
When the work you put in is realized
Let yourself feel the pride but
Always stay humble and kind (Yeah)

[Outro]
When it's hot, eat a root beer popsicle
Shut off the AC and roll the windows down
Let that summer sun shine
Always stay humble and kind
Don't take for granted the love this life gives you
When you get where you're goin', don't forget turn back around
And help the next one in line
Always stay humble and kind"
Tim McGraw,Live Like You Were Dying,"[Verse 1]
Said I was in my early 40's
With a lot of life before me
When a moment came that stopped me on a dime
I spent most of the next days, lookin' at the x-rays
Talkin' 'bout the options and talkin' 'bout sweet time
Asked him when it sank in
That this might really be the real end
How's it hit ya, when you get that kind of news
Man what ya do
And he says

[Chorus 1]
I went sky divin'
I went Rocky Mountain climbin'
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fu Manchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I've been denying
And he said someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'

[Verse 2]
He said I was finally the husband
That most the time I wasn't
And I became a friend a friend would like to have
And all the sudden goin' fishing
Wasn't such an imposition
And I went three times that year I lost my dad
Well I finally read the good book
And I took a good long hard look at what I'd do
If I could do it all again
And then

[Chorus 1]
I went sky divin'
I went Rocky Mountain climbin'
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fu Manchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I've been denying
And he said someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'

[Bridge]
Like tomorrow was a gift and you've got eternity
To think about what you do with it
What could you do with it, what can
I do with with it, what would I do with it

[Chorus 2]
Sky divin'
I went Rocky Mountain climbin'
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fu Manchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I watched an eagle as it was flying
And he said someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'

[Outro]
To live like you were dyin'
To live like you were dyin'
To live like you were dyin'
To live like you were dyin'"
Tim McGraw,Highway Don’t Care,"[Verse 1: Tim McGraw]
Bet your window's rolled down and your hair's pulled back
And I bet you got no idea you're going way too fast
You're trying not to think about what went wrong
Trying not to stop 'til you get where you goin'
You're trying to stay awake so I bet you turn on the radio
And the song goes

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby, oh, baby

The highway won't hold you tonight
The highway don't know you're alive
The highway don't care if you're all alone
But I do, I do
The highway won't dry your tears
The highway don't need you here
The highway don't care if you're coming home
But I do, I do

[Verse 2: Tim McGraw & Taylor Swift]
I bet you got a dead cell phone in your shotgun seat
Yeah, I bet you're bending God's ear talking 'bout me
You're trying not to let the first tear fall out
You're trying not to think about turning around
You're trying not to get lost in the sound but that song is always on
So you sing along

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby, oh baby

The highway don't care if you're coming home
But I do, I do

I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby, oh baby

Tim McGraw,Don’t Take the Girl,"[Verse 1]
Johnny's daddy was taking him fishing
When he was eight years old
A little girl came through the front gate
Holding a fishing pole
His dad looked down and smiled
Said, ""We can't leave her behind
Son, I know you don't want her to go
But someday, you'll change your mind""

[Pre-Chorus]
And Johnny said

[Chorus]
Take Jimmy Johnson, take Tommy Thompson
Take my best friend, Beau
Take anybody that you want
As long as she don't go
Take any boy in the world
Daddy, please, don't take the girl

[Verse 2]
Same old boy, same sweet girl
Ten years down the road
He held her tight and kissed her lips
In front of the picture show
Stranger came and pulled a gun
Grabbed her by the arm
Said, ""If you do what I tell you to
There won't be any harm""

[Pre-Chorus]
And Johnny said

[Chorus]
Take my money, take my wallet
Take my credit cards
Here's the watch that my grandpa gave me
Here's the key to my car
Mister, give it a whirl
But, please, don't take the girl

[Verse 3]
Same old boy, same sweet girl
Five years down the road
There's gonna be a little one
And she says, ""It's time to go""
Doctor says, ""The baby's fine
But you'll have to leave
'Cause his mama's fading fast""
And Johnny hit his knees

[Pre-Chorus]
And there, he prayed

[Chorus]
Take the very breath you gave me
Take the heart from my chest
I'll gladly take her place if you'll let me
Make this my last request
Take me out of this world
God, please, don't take the girl

[Outro]
Johnny's daddy was taking him fishing
When he was eight years old"
Tim McGraw,Meanwhile Back at Mama’s,"[Verse 1: Tim McGraw]
Runnin round in this new truck
Bank lets me borrow from month to month
I'm runnin out of credit, find a little Cash on the radio
Standin still they're blowin past, numbers on cars goin NASCAR fast
What I wouldn't give for a slow down, don't ya know?
'Cause where I come from, only the horses run
When the day is done, we take it easy

[Chorus: Tim McGraw]
Meanwhile back at Mama's
The porch light's on, come on in if you wanna
Supper's on the stove and beer's in the fridge
Red sun sinkin' out low on the ridge
Game's on the tube and Daddy smokes cigarettes
Whiskey keeps his whistle wet
Funny the things you thought you'd never miss
In a world gone crazy as this

[Verse 2: Tim McGraw]
Well I found a girl and we don't fit in here
Talk about how hard it is to breathe here
Even with the windows down can't catch a southern breeze here
One of these days gonna pack it up and leave here
Cause

[Chorus: Tim McGraw and Faith Hill]
Meanwhile back at Mama's
The porch light's on, come on in if you wanna
Supper's on the stove and beer's in the fridge
Red sun sinkin' out low on the ridge
Game's on the tube and Daddy smokes cigarettes
Whiskey keeps his whistle wet
Funny the things you thought you'd never miss
In a world gone crazy as this

[Bridge: Tim McGraw and Faith Hill]
Oh I miss yeah a little dirt on the road, I miss corn growin in a row
I miss being somebody everybody knows, there everybody knows everybody
I miss those small town routes, walkin around in muddy boots
The sound of rain on an old tin roof
It's time we head on back

[Final Chorus: Tim McGraw and Faith Hill]
Cause meanwhile back at Mama's
The for sale sign's goin up and I'm gonna
Dump this truck and the little I got
On a loan to own and a three-acre lot
Put supper on the stove and beer in the fridge
Goin' for broke and we're gonna be rich
Watch the sun settin on the ridge
Baby tell me what you think about this

[Outro:Tim McGraw and Faith Hill]
Me and you back at Mama's
Yeah me and you back at Mama's"
Tim McGraw,Shotgun Rider,"[Verse 1]
Roll, won't you come roll with me
Slow, fast, full speed
Girl where ever sweet time takes us
Hang, with me down this old road
Only God knows where we'll go
Don't matter long as I've got your love

[Chorus]
I don't ever wanna wake up
Looking into someone else's eyes
With another voice calling me ""baby""
On the other end of the phone
A new girl puttin' on her make up
For a dinner on a Friday night
I don't ever wanna know, no, no, no
No other shotgun rider beside me
Singin' to the radio, ooo, oo

[Verse 2]
Slide, slide over nice and close
Lay your head down on my shoulder
You can fall asleep, I'll let you
Dream, life ain't nothing but a dream
Don't wanna be, cruisin' through this dream without you

[Chorus]
I don't ever wanna wake up
Looking into someone else's eyes
Another voice calling me ""baby""
On the other end of the phone
A new girl puttin' on her make up
For a dinner on a Friday night
No I don't ever wanna know, no, no, no
No other shotgun rider beside me
Singin' to the radio, ooo, oo"
Tim McGraw,I Need You,"[Verse 1: Tim McGraw]
I want to drink that shot of whiskey
I want to smoke that cigarette
I want to smell that sweet addiction on my breath
I want to ride across West Virginia in the backseat of a Cadillac
You know some cowboys like me go out like that
So I need you

[Chorus: Tim McGraw]
Like a needle needs a vein
Like my Uncle Joe in Oklahoma needs a rain
I need you like a lighthouse on the coast
Like the father and the son meet the holy ghost
I need you
[Verse 2: Faith Hill]
I want to get lost in some corner booth
Cantina Mexico
I want to dance to the static of an a.m. radio
I want to wrap the moon around us and lay beside you skin on skin
Make love 'til the sun comes up til the sun goes down again
'Cause I need you

[Chorus: Faith Hill]
Like a needle needs a vein
Like my Uncle Joe in Oklahoma needs a rain
I need you like a lighthouse on the coast
Like the father and the son meet the holy ghost
I need you
Oh, I need you

[Verse 3: Tim McGraw]
I want to drink that shot of whiskey
I want to smoke that cigarette
You know some cowboys like me go out like that
So I need you, oh, I need you

Oh, I need you, I need you
I need you, I need you
I need you, I need you, I need you, too"
Tim McGraw,Top of the World,"[Verse 1]
We could have a little double wide planted in an empty field
We could have a big old white picket wrap around on a hill
Don't make a difference to me baby, where the wind takes me, long as I'm with you, girl
We could have something or nothing, still be sitting on top of the world

[Chorus]
'Cause when you got love, like we got love
I'm holding on to heaven, holding on to you
When you got one like I got one
Anyway you looking, it's a hell of a view

Don't know where we're gonna be
But I know we're gonna be
Sitting on top of the world
So keep hanging on to me
Yeah, don't you wanna be
Sitting on top of the world
Top of the world

[Verse 2]
We could be rolling on a couple of Goodyears and painted rust
We could be strolling barefoot in the sand, in the setting sun
Yeah, any way you kiss me flips me and gets me the right kind of tipsy, girl
We could be somewhere or nowhere and still be sitting on top of the world

[Chorus]
'Cause when you got love, like we got love
I'm holding on to heaven, holding on to you
When you got one like I got one
Anyway you looking, it's a hell of a view

Tim McGraw,Just to See You Smile,"[Verse 1]
You always had an eye for things that glittered
But I was far from bein' made of gold
I don't know how but I scraped up the money
I just never could quite tell you no
Just like when you were leavin' Amarillo
Takin' that new job in Tennessee
And I quit mine so we could be together
I can't forget the way you looked at me

[Chorus]
Just to see you smile
I'd do anything that you wanted me to
When all is said and done
I'd never count the cost
It's worth all that's lost
Just to see you smile

[Verse 2]
When you said time was all you really needed
I walked away and let you have your space
'Cause leavin' didn't hurt me near as badly
As the tears I saw rollin' down your face
And yesterday I knew just what you wanted
When you came walkin' up to me with him
So I told you that I was happy for you
And given the chance I'd lie again

[Chorus]
Just to see you smile
I'd do anything that you wanted me to
When all is said and done
I'd never count the cost
It's worth all that's lost
Just to see you smile

[Chorus]
Just to see you smile
I'd do anything that you wanted me to
When all is said and done
I'd never count the cost
It's worth all that's lost
Just to see you smile"
Tim McGraw,Back When,"[Verse 1]
Don't you remember
The fizz in a pepper
Peanuts in a bottle
At ten, two and four
A fried bologna sandwich
With mayo and tomato
Sittin' round the table
Do not happen much anymore

[Pre-Chorus 1]
We got too complicated
It's all way over-rated
I like the old and out-dated
Way of life

[Chorus]
Back when a ho was a hoe
Coke was a Coke
And crack's what you were doing
When you were cracking jokes
Back when a screw was a screw
The wind was all that blew
And when you said I am down with that
Well it meant you had the flu
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when

[Verse 2]
I love my records
Black, shiny vinyl
Clicks and pops
And white noise
Man they sounded fine
I had my favorite stations
The ones that played 'em all
Country, soul and rock-n-roll
What happened to those times

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I am reading Street Slang For Dummies
'Cause they put pop in my country
I want more for my money
The way it was back then

[Chorus]
Back when a ho was a hoe
Coke was a Coke
And crack's what you were doing
When you were cracking jokes
Back when a screw was a screw
The wind was all that blew
And when you said I am down with that
Well it meant you had the flu
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when

[Bridge]
Give me a flat top for strummin'
I want the whole world to be hummin'
Oh, just keep it comin'
The way it was back then

[Chorus]
Back when a ho was a hoe
Coke was a Coke
And crack's what you were doing
When you were cracking jokes
Back when a screw was a screw
The wind was all that blew
And when you said I am down with that
Well it meant you had the flu
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when

[Outro]
I miss back when
I miss back when"
Tim McGraw,My Best Friend,"[Verse 1]
I never had no one that I could count on, I've been let down so many times
And I was tired of hurtin', so tired of searchin' 'til you walked into my life
It was a feeling I'd never known
And for the first time, I didn't feel alone

[Chorus]
You're more than a lover, there could never be another to make me feel the way you do
Oh, we just get closer, I fall in love all over every time I look at you
I don't know where I'd be
Without you here with me
Life with you makes perfect sense
You're my best friend
You're my best friend, oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
You stand by me and you believe in me like nobody ever has
When my world goes crazy, you're right there to save me, you make me see how much I have
And I still tremble when we touch
And, oh, the look in your eyes when we make love

[Chorus]
You're more than a lover, there could never be another to make me feel the way you do
Oh, we just get closer, I fall in love all over every time I look at you
And I don't know where I'd be
Without you here with me
Life with you makes perfect sense
You're my best friend, ooh-oh-oh
You're my best friend, uh-huh

[Chorus]
You're more than a lover, there could never be another to make me feel the way you do
Oh, we just get closer, I fall in love all over every time I look at you
And I don't know where I'd be
Without you here with me
Life with you makes perfect sense
You're my best friend
Oh, you're my best friend (My best friend)
Oh, yeah
Ooh
You're my best friend (My best friend)"
Tim McGraw,Indian Outlaw,"[Chorus]
I'm an Indian outlaw
Half Cherokee and Choctaw
My baby, she's a Chippewa
She's one of a kind

[Verse 1]
All my friends call me Bear Claw
The village chieftain is my paw-paw
He gets his orders from my maw-maw
She makes him walk the line
You can find me in my wigwam
I'll be beatin' on my tom-tom
Pull out the pipe and smoke you some
Hey, and pass it around

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm an Indian outlaw
Half Cherokee and Choctaw
My baby, she's a Chippewa
She's one of a kind

[Verse 2]
I ain't lookin' for trouble
We can ride my pony double
Make your little heart bubble
Lord, like a glass of wine
I remember the medicine man
He caught Running Water in my hands
Drug me around by my headband
Said I wasn't her kind

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm an Indian outlaw
Half Cherokee and Choctaw
My baby, she's a Chippewa
She's one of a kind

[Verse 3]
I can kill a deer or buffalo
With just my arrow and my hickory bow
From a hundred yards, don't you know?
I do it all the time
They all gather 'round my tipi
Late at night, tryin' to catch a peek at me
In nothin' but my buffalo briefs
I got them standin' in line

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm an Indian outlaw
Half Cherokee and Choctaw
My baby, she's a Chippewa
She's one of a kind

[Outro]
Cherokee people, Cherokee tribe
So proud to live, so proud to die"
Tim McGraw,Something Like That,"[Verse 1]
It was Labor Day weekend I was seventeen
I bought a Coke and some gasoline
And I drove out to the county fair
When I saw her for the first time
She was standing there in the ticket line
And it all started right then and there
Oh, a sailor’s sky made a perfect sunset
And that's the day I'll never forget

[Chorus]
I had a barbeque stain on my white tee shirt
She was killing me in that miniskirt
Skipping rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
She had a suntan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
And a heart don't forget something like that

[Verse 2]
Well it was five years later on a southbound plane
I was headed down to New Orleans
To meet some friends of mine for Mardi Gras
When I heard a voice from the past
Coming from a few rows back
And when I looked, I couldn't believe just what I saw
She said I bet you don't remember me
And I said only every other memory

[Chorus]
I had a barbeque stain on my white tee shirt
She was killing me in that miniskirt
Skipping rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
You had a suntan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
And a heart don't forget something like that

[Bridge]
Like an old photograph
Time can make a feeling fade
But the memory of a first love
Never fades away

[Chorus]
I had a barbecue stain on my white tee shirt
She was killing me in that miniskirt
Skipping rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
She had a sun tan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
A heart don’t forget, no a heart don’t forget
I said a heart don’t forget something like that
Oh, not something like that"
Tim McGraw,My Little Girl,"[Verse 1]
Gotta hold on easy as I let you go
Gonna tell you how much I love you
Though you think you already know
I remember I thought you looked like an angel wrapped in pink so soft and warm
You've had me wrapped around your finger since the day you were born

[Chorus]
You're beautiful, baby, from the outside in
Chase your dreams, but always know the road that'll lead you home again
Go on, take on this whole world
But to me you know you'll always be my little girl

[Verse 2]
When you were in trouble, that crooked little smile could melt my heart of stone
Now look at you, I've turned around, and you've almost grown
Sometimes you're asleep I whisper, ""I love you"" in the moonlight at your door
As I walk away, I hear you say, ""Daddy, love you more""

[Chorus]
You're beautiful, baby, from the outside in
Chase your dreams, but always know the road that'll lead you home again
Go on, take on this whole world
But to me you know you'll always be my little girl

[Bridge]
Someday, some boy will come and ask me for your hand
But I won't say, ""Yes"" to him unless I know he's the half
That makes you whole, he has a poet's soul, and the heart of a man's man
I know he'll say that he's in love
But between you and me, he won't be good enough!

[Chorus]
You're beautiful, baby, from the outside in
Chase your dreams, but always know the road that'll lead you home again
Go on, take on this whole world
But to me you know you'll always be my little girl"
Tim McGraw,If You’re Reading This,"[Verse 1]
If you're reading this, my Momma's sitting there
Looks like I only got a one-way ticket over here
Sure wish I could give you one more kiss
And war was just a game we played when we were kids

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm laying down my gun
I'm hanging up boots
I'm up here with God and we're both watching over you

[Chorus]
So lay me down
In that open field out on the edge of town
And know my soul
Is where my momma always prayed
That it would go
And if you're reading this
I'm already home

[Verse 2]
If you're reading this
Halfway around the world
I won’t be there
To see the birth of our little girl
I hope she looks like you
I hope she fights like me
Stand up for the innocent and the weak

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm laying down my gun
I'm hanging up boots
Tell dad I don't regret that I followed in his shoes

[Chorus]
So lay me down
In that open field out on the edge of town
And know my soul
Is where my momma always prayed
That it would go
And if you're reading this
I'm already home

[Verse 3]
If you're reading this
There’s going to come a day
When you'll move on
And find someone else
And that's OK
Just remember this
I'm in a better place
Where soldiers live in peace
And angels sing amazing grace

[Chorus]
So lay me down
In that open field out on the edge of town
And know my soul
Is where my momma always prayed
That it would go
And if you're reading this
If you're reading this
I'm already home"
Tim McGraw,Standing Room Only,"[Verse 1]
I get so mad at things that don't matter way too much
I let the way back whens and my old friends scatter like they were dust
I get to chasin' that rainbow pot of gold right into the pourin' rain
With nothin' to show for it, standin' there soakin' wet
Lookin' up, shakin' my fist as the thunder rolls
Now and then on nights like this, I catch a thunderbolt

[Chorus]
I wanna live a life, live a life
Like a dollar and the clock on the wall don't own me
Shine a light, shine a light
Like mama's front porch when I'm lost and lonely
Start forgivin' and start forgettin'
Be somebody that's worth rememberin'
Live a life so when I die
There's standing room only, standing room only
Standing room only, standing room only

[Verse 2]
I wanna take my grudges and my old regrets, and let 'em go
I wanna learn how to say a lot more yes and a lot less no
Girl, I wanna dance and shout and love out loud, and come alive
Don't wanna be the guy too cool to laugh and too scared to cry

[Chorus]
I wanna live a life, live a life
Like a dollar and the clock on the wall don't own me
Shine a light, shine a light
Like mama's front porch when I'm lost and lonely
Start forgivin' and start forgettin'
Be somebody that's worth rememberin'
Live a life so when I die
There's standing room only, standing room only

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Stop judging my life by my possessions
Start thinking 'bout how many headlights will be in my procession

[Chorus]
I wanna live a life, live a life
Like a dollar and the clock on the wall don't own me
Shine a light, shine a light
Like mama's front porch when I'm lost and lonely
Start forgivin' and start forgettin'
Be somebody that's worth rememberin'
Live a life so when I die
There's standing room only, standing room only

[Outro]
Standing room only, standing room only
Standing room only, standing room only
Standing room only, standing room only"
Tim McGraw,"I Like It, I Love It","[Verse 1]
Spent forty-eight dollars last night at the county fair
I threw out my shoulder but I won her that teddy bear
She's got me sayin' sugar-pie, honey, darlin', and dear
I ain't seen the Braves play a game all year
I'm gonna get fired if I don't get some sleep
My long lost buddies say I'm gettin' in too deep

[Chorus]
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard, I can't rise above it
Don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it

[Verse 2]
My Mama and Daddy tried to teach me courtesy
But it never sank in 'til that girl got a hold of me
Now I'm holdin' umbrellas and openin' up doors
I'm takin' out the trash and I'm sweepin' my floors
I'm crossin' my fingers and countin' every kiss
Prayin' that it keeps goin' on like this

[Chorus]
'Cause I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard, I can't rise above it
Don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it

[Bridge]
Gotta wash my truck and dress up
To pick her up to watch TV
And she sits down on the sofa, she'll move a little closer
She can't get enough of me

[Chorus]
Yeah, I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard, I can't rise above it
Don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it

[Outro]
Come on, baby
You know what I like
Yeah, I like that
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Hey, don't forget to turn out the lights"
Tim McGraw,I Called Mama,"[Verse 1]
Got a call from a friend about a friend
With some news no one ever wants to hear
It hit me like a punch, it took my breath
He was just gettin' into his best years
Yeah, somethin' like that'll shake you up
Wake you up

[Chorus]
So I stopped off at a Texaco, bought a Slim Jim and a coke
Parked out by the water just to watch that river flow
Grabbed my guitar from the back seat, wrote a song just for me
And I sung it for the blue sky and a couple live oak trees
I thought of home, grabbed my phone from my pocket
And I called mama

[Verse 2]
It rang a couple times, and she picked up
I can always hear her smile when I call
I just called to tell you that I loved you
I was missing you and dad and home, that's all
I got to really thinking this morning
About what's important

[Chorus]
So I stopped off at a Texaco, bought a Slim Jim and a coke
Parked out by the water just to watch that river flow
Grabbed my guitar from the back seat, wrote a song just for me
And I sung it for the blue sky and a couple live oak trees
I thought of home, grabbed my phone from my pocket
And I called mama

[Bridge]
And from now on
I ain't gonna wait so long

[Chorus]
To stop off at a Texaco, buy a Slim Jim and a coke
Park out by the water just to watch that river flow
Grab my guitar from the back seat, write a song just for me
Sing it for the blue sky and a couple live oak trees
I think of home, grab my phone from my pocket
Instead of sayin' tomorrow, I'm gonna
And I called mama
And I called mama"
Tim McGraw,Thought About You,"[Verse 1]
Saw a young Mama laughin' talkin' on the phone
With a little girl workin' on an ice cream cone
Drippin' on her shoes
And I thought about you

[Verse 2]
Saw a spring break Honda hell-bent for Daytona
The boys in the back hiding their Corona
Like kids do
And I thought about you

[Pre-Chorus]
I thought about me
I thought about God
Everything love is
And everything it's not

[Chorus]
I thought about songs that make us feel better
I thought about faith that ties it all together
I thought about now, then thought about forever
I thought about fire and how we walked through it
The times I got it right, the times I blew it
I thought about real, I thought about good, I thought about true
And I thought about you

[Verse 3]
I saw ""hungry"" misspelled on a cardboard sign
And a dirty t-shirt that said ""Roll Tide""
So I gave him a few
And I thought about you

[Verse 4]
Ran into a buddy, he said ""How long's it been?""
I said ""A couple years,"" he said ""Boy, it's been ten""
That's what time'll do
And I thought about you

[Chorus]
I thought about songs that make us feel better
I thought about faith that ties it all together
I thought about now, then thought about forever
I thought about fire and how we walked through it
The times I got it right, the times I blew it
I thought about real, I thought about good, I thought about true
And I thought about you
I thought about you

[Post-Chorus]
I thought about me
I thought about God
Everything love is
And everything it's not

[Verse 5]
I saw a red balloon somebody just let fly
I watched it gettin' smaller up in the sky
For a minute or two
And I thought about you"
Tim McGraw,Red Ragtop,"[Verse 1]
I was twenty and she was eighteen
We were just about as wild as we were green in the ways of the world
Well, she picked me up in that red ragtop
We were free of the folks and hidin' from the cops
On a summer night, runnin' all the red lights
We parked way out in a clearing in a grove
And the night was as hot as a coal burnin' stove
We were cooking with gas
Knew it had to last

[Chorus]
In the back of that red ragtop
She said, ""Please, don't stop""

[Verse 2]
Well, the very first time her mother met me
Her green-eyed girl had been a mother to be
For two weeks (Ooh)
I was out of a job and she was in school
And life was fast and the world was cruel
We were young and wild (Ooh)
We decided not to have a child
So we did what we did and we tried to forget
And we swore up and down, there would be no regrets
In the morning light
But on the way home that night

[Chorus]
On the back of that red ragtop
She said, ""Please, don't stop
Loving me""

[Bridge]
We took one more trip around the sun
But it was all make believe in the end (In the end)
No, I can't say where she is today
I can't remember who I was back then

[Verse 3]
Well, you do what you do and you pay for your sins
And there's no such thing as what might've been
That's a waste of time, drive you out of your mind
I was stopped at a red light just yesterday
Beside a young girl in a cabriolet
And her eyes were green
And I was in an old scene

[Chorus]
I was back in that red ragtop
On the day she stopped
Loving me
I was back in that red ragtop
On the day she stopped
Loving me

[Instrumental Outro]"
Tim McGraw,Where the Green Grass Grows,"[Verse 1]
Six lanes, taillights
Red ants marchin' into the night
They disappear to the left and right again
Another supper from a sack
A ninety-nine cent heart attack
I got a poundin' head and an achin' back
And the camel's buried in a big straw stack

[Chorus]
I'm gonna live where the green grass grows
Watch my corn pop up in rows
Every night be tucked in close to you
Raise our kids where the good Lord's blessed
Point our rockin' chairs towards the west
And plant our dreams where the peaceful river flows
Where the green grass grows

[Verse 2]
Well I'm from a map dot
A stop sign on a black top
I caught the first bus I could hop from there
But all of this glitter is a-gettin' dark
There's concrete growin' in the city park
I don't know who my neighbors are
And there's bars on the corners and bars on my heart

[Chorus]
I'm gonna live where the green grass grows
Watch my corn pop up in rows
Every night be tucked in close to you
Raise our kids where the good Lord's blessed
Point our rockin' chairs towards the west
And plant our dreams where the peaceful river flows
Where the green grass grows

[Chorus]
I'm gonna live where the green grass grows
Watchin' my corn pop up in rows
Every night be tucked in close to you
Raise our kids where the good Lord's blessed
Point our rockin' chairs towards the west
And plant our dreams where the peaceful river flows
Where the green grass grows"
Tim McGraw,7500 OBO,"[Verse 1]
Got an '06, stick shift
Dark blue F150 in good condition
Got a hundred and nineteen thousand miles
Only five on the new transmission

[Pre-Chorus]
It's got leather seats, a sun roof
It's sittin' on thirty-threes, it runs smooth
It'll get you from A to B, but not for me
'Cause every time I turn that key, I see her

[Chorus]
Shotgun ridin' down a two-lane road
Just drivin' around with no place to go, ah
Singin' along to ""Where the Green Grass Grows""
Hands out the window, floatin' on the breeze
She's fixin' her lips in the dropdown mirror
That pretty little thing made it hard to steer
I'm never gonna get her out of there
There's too many memories
Now there's a ""For sale"" sign in the window
Yeah, 'cause if I'm gonna let her go
I gotta let it go, yeah, it's gotta go
So it's $7500 OBO

[Verse 2]
Back bumper's got a dent from her backin' in
To a mailbox first time she drove it
Couldn't even be mad with her lookin' like that
Told her, ""Hell, you can hardly even notice""

[Pre-Chorus]
It's got nights with her I can't forget
Kissin' on the tailgate of the truck bed
I wish I didn't have to get rid of it
But every time I turn that key, I see her

Shotgun ridin' down a two-lane road
Just drivin' around with no place to go, ah
Singin' along to ""Where the Green Grass Grows""

Tim McGraw,Neon Church,"[Verse 1]
I need Jesus or I need whiskey
Whatever works best to get me through
Gettin' over you
A little Friday night hallelujah
A congregation of backsliders just like me
Yeah, what I need

[Chorus]
Is a neon church
With a jukebox choir
Full of honky tonk angels
With their wings on fire
Straight pourin' out that Johnnie Walker healin'
I got a feelin'
I need a neon church

[Verse 2]
Baptize me in that barroom smoke
Bartender, preach to me 'til my heart ain't broke no more
Ain't that what this place is for?
I tried bended knee, hands-up prayin'
But damn did that hurt, don't just keep hangin' around
What I need right now

[Chorus]
Is a neon church
With a jukebox choir
Full of honky tonk angels
With their wings on fire
Straight pourin' out that Johnnie Walker healin'
I got a feelin'
I need a neon church

[Bridge]
Just a-sippin' down that unholy water
Save that hurt-like-hell for tomorrow
I'll stay here all night
In a neon church
With the party crowd
Where the good times roll
And the music's loud
Instead of home starin' holes in the ceiling
I got a feeling

[Chorus]
I need a neon church
With a jukebox choir
Full of honky tonk angels
With their wings on fire
Straight pourin' out that Johnnie Walker healin'
I got a feelin'
I need a neon church
I need a neon church"
Tim McGraw,The Cowboy In Me,"[Verse 1]
I don't know why I act the way I do
Like I ain't got a single thing to lose
Sometimes I'm my own worst enemy
I guess that's just the cowboy in me

I got a life that most would love to have
But sometimes I still wake up fighting mad
At where this road I am heading down might lead
I guess that's just the cowboy in me

[Chorus]
The urge to run, the restlessness
The heart of stone I sometimes get
The things I've done for foolish pride
The me that's never satisfied
The face that's in the mirror when I don't like what I see
I guess that's just the cowboy in me

The urge to run, the restlessness
The heart of stone I sometimes get
The things I've done for foolish pride
The me that's never satisfied
The face that's in the mirror when I don't like what I see
I guess that's just the cowboy in me

[Verse 2]
Girl I know there's times you must have thought
There ain't a line you've drawn I haven't crossed
But you set your mind to see this love on through
I guess that's just the cowboy in you

[Outro]
We ride and never worry about the fall
I guess that's just the cowboy in us all"
Tim McGraw,Diamond Rings and Old Barstools,"[Verse 1]
Diamond rings and old barstools
One's for queens and one's for fools
One's the future and one's the past
One's forever and one won't last

[Chorus]
It ain't like midnight and cigarette smoke
It ain't like watered down whiskey and Coke
I guess some things just don't mix like you hoped
Like me and you
And diamond rings and old barstools

[Verse 2]
The wrongs and rights, the highs and lows
The ""I love yous,"" the ""I told you sos""
Past few miles to wherever's home
Another morning waking up alone

[Chorus]
It ain't like midnight and cigarette smoke
It ain't like watered down whiskey and Coke
I guess some things just don't mix like you hoped
Like me and you
And diamond rings and old barstools

[Outro]
We ain't like midnight and cigarette smoke
Nothing like watered down whiskey and Coke
I guess some things just don't mix like you hoped
Like me and you
And diamond rings and old barstools"
Brad Paisley,Whiskey Lullaby,"[Verse 1: Brad Paisley]
She put him out
Like the burnin' end of a midnight cigarette
She broke his heart
He spent his whole life tryin' to forget
We watched him drink his pain away
A little at a time
But he never could get drunk enough
To get her off his mind
Until the night

[Chorus: Brad Paisley & Alison Krauss]
He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away her memory
Life is short, but this time, it was bigger
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
We found him with his face down in the pillow
With a note that said, ""I'll love her 'til I die""
And when we buried him beneath the willow
The angels sang a whiskey lullaby

[Post-Chorus: Brad Paisley & Alison Krauss]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Verse 2: Alison Krauss]
The rumors flew
But nobody knew how much she blamed herself
For years and years
She tried to hide the whiskey on her breath
She finally drank her pain away
A little at a time
But she never could get drunk enough
To get him off her mind
Until the night

[Chorus: Brad Paisley & Alison Krauss]
She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away his memory
Life is short, but this time, it was bigger
Than the strength she had to get up off her knees
We found her with her face down in the pillow
Clinging to his picture for dear life
We laid her next to him beneath the willow
While the angels sang a whiskey lullaby

[Outro: Brad Paisley & Alison Krauss]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la"
Brad Paisley,Accidental Racist,"[Verse 1: Brad Paisley]
To the man that waited on me at the Starbucks down on Main
I hope you understand
When I put on that T-shirt, the only thing I meant to say
Is I'm a Skynyrd fan
The red flag on my chest somehow is
Like the elephant in the corner of the south
And I just walked him right in the room
Just a proud rebel son with an ol' can of worms
Lookin' like I got a lot to learn, but from my point of view

[Chorus: Brad Paisley]
I'm just a white man coming to you from the Southland
Tryin' to understand what it's like not to be
I'm proud of where I'm from but not everything we've done
And it ain't like you and me can re-write history
Our generation didn't start this nation
We're still picking up the pieces, walking on eggshells, fighting over yesterday
And caught between Southern pride and Southern blame

[Verse 2: Brad Paisley]
They called it Reconstruction, fixed the buildings, dried some tears
We're still siftin' through the rubble after a hundred-fifty years
I try to put myself in your shoes and that's a good place to begin
But it ain't like I can walk a mile in someone else's skin

[Chorus: Brad Paisley]
'Cause I'm a white man livin' in the southland
Just like you I'm more than what you see
I'm proud of where I'm from but not everything we've done
And it ain't like you and me can re-write history
Our generation didn't start this nation
And we're still paying for our mistakes
That a bunch of folks made long before we came
And caught somewhere between southern pride and southern blame
[Verse 3: LL Cool J]
Dear Mr. White Man, I wish you understood
What the world is really like when you're living in the hood
Just because my pants are sagging doesn't mean I'm up to no good
You should try to get to know me, I really wish you would
Now my chains are gold but I'm still misunderstood
I wasn't there when Sherman's March turned the south into firewood
I want you to get paid but be a slave I never could
Feel like a new fangled Django, dodging invisible white hoods
So when I see that white cowboy hat, I'm thinking it's not all good
I guess we're both guilty of judging the cover not the book
I'd love to buy you a beer, conversate and clear the air
But I see that red flag and I think you wish I wasn't here
[Chorus: Brad Paisley (w/ LL Cool J ad libs)]
I'm just a white man
(If you don't judge my durag)
Comin' to you from the southland
(I won't judge your red flag)
Tryin' to understand what it's like not to be
(Yeah)
I'm proud of where I'm from
(If you don't judge my gold chains)
But not everything we've done
(I'll forget the iron chains)
It ain't like you and me can re-write history
(Can't re-write history baby)

[Outro: Brad Paisley (LL Cool J)]
Oh, Dixieland
(The relationship between the Mason-Dixon needs some fixin')
I hope you understand what this is all about
(Quite frankly I'm a black Yankee
But I've been thinkin' about this lately)
I'm a son of the new south
(The past is the past, you feel me)
And I just want to make things right
(Let bygones be bygones)
Where all that's left is southern pride
(RIP Robert E. Lee
But I've gotta thank Abraham Lincoln for freeing me
Know what I mean?) It's real, it's real
It's truth"
Brad Paisley,I’m Gonna Miss Her,"[Verse 1]
Well I love her
But I love to fish
I spend all day out on this lake
And hell is all I catch
But today she met me at the door
Said I would have to choose
If I hit that fishing hole today
She'd be packing all her things
And she'd be gone by noon

[Chorus]
Well, I'm gonna miss her
When I get home
But right now I'm on this lakeshore
And I'm sitting in the sun
I'm sure it'll hit me
When I walk through that door tonight
Yeah, I'm going miss her
Oh, look there, I've got a bite!

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Now there's a chance that if I hurry
I could beg her to stay
But that water's right
And the weather's perfect
No telling what I might catch today

[Chorus]
So, I'm gonna miss her
When I get home
But right now I'm on this lakeshore
And I'm sitting in the sun
I'm sure it'll hit me
When I walk through that door tonight
Yeah, I'm gonna miss her
Oh, look there, another bite!

[Outro]
Yeah, I'm gonna miss her
Oh, look there, I've got a bite!"
Brad Paisley,Last Time for Everything,"[Verse 1]
Using a fake ID at a college bar
Getting caught with a girl in the backseat of a car
Running out on the field for the senior game wearing number 17
There's a last time for everything

[Verse 2]
Like a George Strait cassette in a Pontiac
Or telling Supercuts, ""Let's leave it long in the back""
Wearing a tux in a high school gym
And she's wearing your class ring
There's a last time for everything

[Chorus]
Last call, last chance
Last song, last dance
Sometimes you just don't know when that's gonna be
Hold me baby, give me a kiss
Like tonight is all there is
'Cause there's a last time for everything

[Verse 3]
Throwing the ball with the first dog you ever had
Spending all day on the lake with your grandad
Watching Glenn Frey sing ""Already Gone"" at the Forum in LA
There's a last time for everything

[Chorus]
Last call, last chance
Last song, last dance
Sometimes you just don't know when that's gonna be
Hold me baby, give me a kiss
Like tonight is all there is
Cause there's a last time for everything

[Verse 4]
Kissing goodbye on her porch and driving away
Introducing her as your fiancee
Getting woke up at 5 am to see if Santa came
There's a last time for everything

[Verse 5/Outro]
Biscuits and gravy at your momma's house
(Last time for everything)
Spring break on a fold out couch
(Last time for everything)
Little Jimmy on the Opry stage
(Last time for everything)
Hearing Prince sing ""Purple Rain""
(Last time for everything)
(Last time for everything)"
Brad Paisley,I’m Still a Guy,"[Verse 1]
When you see a deer, you see Bambi
And I see antlers up on the wall
When you see a lake, you think picnics
And I see a largemouth up under that log
You're probably thinkin' that you're gonna change me
In some ways, well, maybe you might
Scrub me down, dress me up, oh, but no matter what
Remember I'm still a guy

[Verse 2]
When you see a priceless French paintin'
I see a drunk, naked girl
You think that ridin' a wild bull sounds crazy
And I'd like to give it a whirl
Well, love makes a man do some things he ain't proud of
And in a weak moment, I might
Walk your sissy dog, hold your purse at the mall
But remember I'm still a guy

[Chorus]
And I'll pour out my heart, hold your hand in the car
Write a love song that makes you cry
Then turn right around, knock some jerk to the ground
'Cause he copped a feel as you walked by

[Verse 3]
I can hear you now talkin' to your friends
Sayin', ""Yeah, girls, he's come a long way""
From draggin' his knuckles and carryin' a club
And buildin' a fire in a cave
But when you say a backrub means only a backrub
Then you swat my hand when I try
Well, now, what can I say? At the end of the day
Honey, I'm still a guy

[Chorus]
And I'll pour out my heart, hold your hand in the car
Write a love song that makes you cry
Then turn right around, knock some jerk to the ground
'Cause he copped a feel as you walked by

[Verse 4]
These days, there's dudes gettin' facials
Manicured, waxed, and botoxed
With deep spray-on tans and creamy lotion-y hands
You can't grip a tacklebox
Yeah, with all of these men linin' up to get neutered
It's hip now to be feminized
But I don't highlight my hair, I've still got a pair
Yeah, honey, I'm still a guy

[Outro]
Oh, my eyebrows ain't plucked, there's a gun in my truck
Oh, thank God I'm still a guy
Yeah, boy"
Brad Paisley,She’s Everything,"[Verse 1]
She's a yellow pair of running shoes
A holey pair of jeans
She looks great in cheap sunglasses
She looks great in anything
She's I want a piece of chocolate
Take me to a movie
She's I can't find a thing to wear
Now and then she's moody

[Verse 2]
She's a Saturn with a sunroof
With her brown hair a-blowing
She's a soft place to land
And a good feeling knowing
She's a warm conversation
That I wouldn't miss for nothing
She's a fighter when she's mad
And she's a lover when she's loving

[Chorus]
And she's everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
I talk about her, I go on and on and on
Cause she's everything to me

[Verse 3]
She's a Saturday out on the town
And a church girl on Sunday
She's a cross around her neck
And a cuss word cause it's Monday
She's a bubble bath and candles
Baby come and kiss me
She's a one glass of wine
And she's feeling kinda tipsy

[Verse 4]
She's the giver I wish I could be
And the stealer of the covers
She's a picture in my wallet
And my unborn children's mother
She's the hand that I'm holding
When I'm on my knees and praying
She's the answer to my prayer
And she's the song that I'm playing

[Chorus]
And she's everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
I talk about her, I go on and on and on
Cause she's everything to me

[Verse 5]
She's the voice I love to hear
Someday when I'm ninety
She's that wooden rocking chair
I want rocking right beside me
Everyday that passes
I only love her more
Yeah, she's the one
That I'd lay down my own life for

[Verse 6]
And she's everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
She's everything to me
Yeah she's everything to me

[Outro]
Everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
She's everything to me"
Brad Paisley,Perfect Storm,"[Verse 1]
If she was a drink
She'd be a single-barrelled Bourbon on ice
Smooth with a kick
A chill and a burn all at the same time

[Pre-Chorus]
She's Sunday drive meets
High speed chase
She ain't just a song
She's the whole mixtape
She's so complicated
That's the way God made her
Sunshine mixed with a little hurricane

[Chorus]
And she destroys me in that t-shirt
And I love her so much it hurts
I never meant to fall like this
She don't just rain she pours
That girl right there's the perfect storm

[Verse 2]
I know how to make her laugh
Or blush, or mad at me
But that's okay there ain't no one more beautiful angry

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And she loves just as deep
As she goes when she's down
The highs match the lows
Can't have one without the other
And I love her just the way God made her
Sunshine mixed with a little hurricane

[Chorus]
And she destroys me in that t-shirt
And I love her so much it hurts
I never meant to fall like this
But she don't just rain she pours
That girl right there's the perfect storm

[Outro]
She's the girl of a lifetime
A guy like me spends his whole life
Looking for, that girl right there's the perfect storm
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
She destroys me in that t-shirt"
Brad Paisley,Then,"[Verse 1]
I remember trying not to stare
The night that I first met you
You had me mesmerized
And three weeks later
In the front porch light
Taking 45 minutes to kiss goodnight
I hadn't told you yet
But I thought I loved you then

[Chorus]
And now you're my whole life
Now you're my whole world
I just can't believe
The way I feel about you girl
Like a river meets the sea
Stronger than it’s ever been
We've come so far since that day
And I thought I loved you then

[Verse 2]
And I remember taking you back
To right where I first met you
You were so surprised
There were people around
But I didn't care
I got down on one knee right there
And once again
I thought I loved you then

[Chorus]
Now you're my whole life
Now you're my whole world
I just can't believe
The way I feel about you girl
Like a river meets the sea
Stronger than it’s ever been
We've come so far since that day
And I thought I loved you then

[Verse 3]
I can just see you
With a baby on the way
I can just see you
When your hair is turning grey
What I can't see
Is how I'm ever going to love you more
But I've said that before

[Chorus 2]
And now you're my whole life
Now you're my whole world
I just can't believe
The way I feel about you girl
We'll look back someday
At this moment that we're in
And I'll look at you and say
And I thought I loved you then
And I thought I loved you then

[Outro]
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo"
Brad Paisley,Find Yourself,"[Verse 1]
When you find yourself
In some far off place
And it causes you
To rethink some things
You start to sense
That slowly you're becoming someone else
And then you find yourself

[Verse 2]
[When you make new friends
In a brand new town](24869587)
[And you start to think
About settling down](24869599)
[The things that would have been lost on you
Are now clear as a bell](24869623)
And you find yourself
Yeah that's when you find yourself

[Chorus]
[Well you go through life
So sure of where you're heading
And you wind up lost
And it's the best thing that could have happened](24869557)
'Cause sometimes when you lose your way
It's really just as well
'Cause you find yourself
Yeah, that's when you find yourself

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
When you meet the one
That you've been waiting for
[And she's everything
That you wanted and more](24869547)
You look at her and you finally start
To live for someone else
And then you find yourself
Yeah that's when you find yourself

[Chorus]
We go through life
So sure of where we're heading
And then we wind up lost
And it's the best thing that could have happened
And sometimes when you lose your way
It's really just as well
Because you find yourself
Yeah, that's when you find yourself"
Brad Paisley,Today,"[Verse 1]
When I'm sitting in traffic some afternoon
Or bored to death in some waiting room
I'm gonna close my eyes and picture you
Today

[Verse 2]
You keep brushing that hair back out of your eyes
It just keeps falling and so do I
Well I'm feeling like the luckiest man alive
Today

[Chorus]
I don't know about tomorrow
But right now the whole world feels right
And the memory of a day like today
Could get you through the rest of your life

[Verse 3]
I know it won't always be like this
Life could change as quick as a kiss
It's not over yet and I already miss
Today

[Chorus]
I don't know about tomorrow
But right now the whole world is right
And the memory of a day like today
Could get you through the rest of your life

[Bridge]
And as the seasons change and time goes bye
When your hair is grey and so is mine
I know for sure that you're gonna be
Just as beautiful as you are to me
Today

Bring on tomorrow, I've got today
Bring on tomorrow, I've got today
Bring on tomorrow, right now the whole world is right
Bring on tomorrow

[Outro]
Because a memory of a day like today
Could get you through the rest of your life"
Brad Paisley,Alcohol,"[Verse 1]
I can make anybody pretty
I can make you believe any lie
I can make you pick a fight
With somebody twice your size

[Verse 2]
Well, I've been known to cause a few break ups
And I've been known to cause a few births
Well, I can make you new friends
Or get you fired from work

[Chorus 1]
And since the day I left Milwaukee
Lynchburg and Bordeaux, France
Been making the bars
Lots of big money
And helping white people dance

[Chorus 2]
I got you in trouble in high school
But college, now that was a ball
You had some of the best times
You'll never remember with me

[Post-Chorus]
Alcohol
Alcohol

[Verse 3]
I got blamed at your wedding reception
For your best man's embarrassing speech
And also for those
Naked pictures of you at the beach

[Verse 4]
I've influenced kings and world leaders
I helped Hemingway write like he did
And I'll bet you a drink or two
That I can make you
Put that lampshade on your head

[Chorus 3]
Cause since the day I left Milwaukee
Lynchburg and and Bordeaux, France
Been making a fool out of folks just like you
And helping white people dance

[Chorus 4]
I'm medicine and I am poison
I can help you up or make you fall
You had some of the best times
You'll never remember with me

[Post-Chorus]
Alcohol
Alcohol

[Chorus 1]
Yeah since the day I left Milwaukee
Lynchburg and Bordeaux, France
Been making the bars
Lots of big money
And helping white people dance

I got you in trouble in high school
But college, now that was a ball
You had some of the best times
You'll never remember with me

Brad Paisley,Letter to Me,"[Verse 1]
If I could write a letter to me
And send it back in time to myself at seventeen
First, I'd prove it's me by sayin' look under your bed
There's a Skoal can and a Playboy no one else would know you hid
And then I'd say I know it's tough
When you break up after seven months

[Pre-Chorus]
And yeah, I know you really liked her and it just don't seem fair
But all I can say is pain like that is fast and it's rare

[Chorus]
And, oh, you got so much goin' for you, goin' right
But I know at seventeen it's hard to see past Friday night
She wasn't right for you and still you feel like there's a knife
Stickin' out of your back and you're wonderin' if you'll survive
But you'll make it through this and you'll see
You're still around to write this letter to me

[Verse 2]
At the stop sign at Tomlinson and Eighth
Always stop completely, well, don't just tap your brakes
And when you get a date with Bridgett, make sure the tank is full
On second thought, forget it, that one turns out kinda cool
Each and every time you have a fight
Just assume you're wrong and Dad is right

[Pre-Chorus]
And you should really thank Mrs. Brinkman, she spends so much extra time
It's like she sees the diamond underneath and she's polishin' you 'til you shine

[Chorus]
And, oh, you got so much goin' for you, goin' right
But I know at seventeen it's hard to see past Friday night
Tonight's the bonfire rally, but you're stayin' home instead
Because if you fail Algebra, Mom and Dad'll kill you dead
But trust me, you'll squeak by and get a C
And you're still around to write this letter to me

[Bridge]
Well, you got so much up ahead and you'll make new friends
You should see your kids and wife
And I'd end by sayin' have no fear
These are nowhere near the best years of your life

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess I'll see you in the mirror when you're a grown man
P.S., go hug Aunt Rita every chance you can

[Chorus]
And, oh, you got so much goin' for you, goin' right
But I know at seventeen it's hard to see past Friday night
I, I wish you'd study Spanish, I wish you'd take a typin' class
I wish you wouldn't worry, let it be
Hey, I'd say have a little faith and you'll see

[Outro]
If I could write a letter to me
To me"
Brad Paisley,We Danced,"[Verse 1]
The bar was empty
I was sweepin' up the floor
That's when she walked in
I said, ""I'm sorry but we're closed""
And she said, ""I know
But I'm afraid I left my purse""
I said, ""I put one back behind the bar
I bet it's probably yours""

[Pre-Chorus]
And the next thing that I knew
There we were, lost in conversation
Before I handed her her purse
I said, ""You'll only get this back on one condition""

[Chorus]
And we danced
Out there on that empty hardwood floor
The chairs up and the lights turned way down low
The music played, we held each other close
And we danced

[Verse 2]
And from that moment
There was never any doubt
I had found the one
That I had always dreamed about
And then one evenin'
When she stopped by after work
I pulled a diamond ring
Out of the pocket of my shirt

[Pre-Chorus]
And as her eyes filled up with tears
She said, ""This is the last thing I expected""
And then she took me by the hand
And said, ""I'll only marry you on one condition""

[Chorus]
And we danced
Out there on that empty hardwood floor
The chairs up and the lights turned way down low
The music played, we held each other close
And we danced
Like no one else had ever danced before
I can't explain what happened on that floor
But the music played, we held each other close
And we danced
Yeah, we danced"
Brad Paisley,Mud On the Tires,"[Verse 1]
I've got some big news
The bank finally came through
And I'm holding the keys to
A brand-new Chevrolet
Have you been outside?
It sure is a nice night
How about a little test drive
Down by the lake?

[Pre-Chorus]
There's a place I know about
Where the dirt road runs out
And we can try out the four-wheel drive
Come on now, what do you say?
Girl, I can hardly wait
To get a little mud on the tires

[Chorus]
'Cause it's a good night
To be out there soakin' up the moonlight
Stake out a little piece of shoreline
I've got the perfect place in mind
It's in the middle of nowhere
Only one way to get there
You gotta get a little mud on the tires

[Verse 2]
Moonlight on a duck blind
Catfish on a trot line
Sun sets about nine
This time of year
We can throw a blanket down
Crickets singing in the background
And more stars than you can count
On a night this clear

[Pre-Chorus]
I tell you what we need to do
Is grab a sleeping bag or two
And build us a little campfire
And then with a little luck
We might just get stuck
Let's get a little mud on the tires

[Chorus]
'Cause it's a good night
To be out there soakin' up the moonlight
Stake out a little piece of shoreline
I've got the perfect place in mind
It's in the middle of nowhere
Only one way to get there
You gotta get a little mud on the tires

[Outro]
And then with a little luck
We might just get stuck
Let's get a little mud on the tires"
Brad Paisley,He Didn’t Have to Be,"[Verse 1]
When a single mom goes out on a date with somebody new
It always winds up feelin' more like a job interview
My momma used to wonder if she'd ever meet someone
Who wouldn't find out about me and then turn around and run

[Verse 2]
I met the man I call my dad when I was five years old
He took my mom out to a movie and for once I got to go
A few months later I remember lyin' there in bed
I overheard him pop the question and prayed that she'd say yes

[Chorus]
And then all of a sudden, oh, it seemed so strange to me
How we went from something's missin' to a family
Lookin' back all I can say about all the things he did for me
Is I hope I'm at least half the dad that he didn't have to be

[Verse 3]
I met the girl that's now my wife about three years ago
We had the perfect marriage but we wanted somethin' more
Now here I stand surrounded by our family and friends
Crowded 'round the nursery window as they bring the baby in

[Chorus]
And now all of a sudden, oh, it seems so strange to me
How we've gone from something's missin' to a family
Lookin' through the glass I think about the man that's standin' next to me
And I hope I'm at least half the dad that he didn't have to be

[Interlude]

[Bridge]
And lookin' back all I can say about all the things he did for me
Is I hope I'm at least half the dad that he didn't have to be

[Outro]
Yeah, I hope I'm at least half the dad that he didn't have to be
Because he didn't have to be
You know he didn't have to be"
Brad Paisley,When I Get Where I’m Going,"[Verse 1]
When I get where I'm going
On the far side of the sky
The first thing that I'm gonna do
Is spread my wings and fly

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna land beside a lion
And run my fingers through his mane
Or I might find out what it's like
To ride a drop of rain

[Chorus]
Yeah when I get where I'm going
There'll be only happy tears
I will shed the sins and struggles
I have carried all these years
And I'll leave my heart wide open
I will love and have no fear
Yeah when I get where I'm going
Don't cry for me down here

[Verse 3]
I'm gonna walk with my grandaddy
And he'll match me step for step
And I'll tell him how I missed him
Every minute since he left
Then I'll hug his neck

[Chorus]
Yeah when I get where I'm going
There'll be only happy tears
I will shed the sins and struggles
I have carried all these years
And I'll leave my heart wide open
I will love and have no fear
Yeah when I get where I'm going
Don't cry for me down here

[Verse 4]
So much pain and so much darkness
In this world we stumble through
All these questions I can't answer
So much work to do

[Verse 5]
But when I get where I'm going
And I see my maker's face
I'll stand forever in the light
Of his amazing grace
Yeah when I get where I'm going
There'll be only happy tears
Hallelujah
I will love and have no fear
When I get where I'm going
Yeah when I get where I'm going"
Brad Paisley,Waitin’ On a Woman,"[Verse 1]
Sittin' on a bench at West Town Mall
He sat down in his overalls and asked me
""You waitin' on a woman?
I nodded ""yeah"" and said, ""How 'bout you?""
He said, ""Son, since 1952, I've been
Waitin' on a woman""

[Pre-Chorus]
""When I picked her up for our first date
I told her I'd be there at 8
And she came down the stairs at 8:30
She said, 'I'm sorry that I took so long
Didn't like a thing that I tried on'
But let me tell you, son, she sure looked pretty""

[Chorus]
""Yeah, she'll take her time
But I don't mind waitin' on a woman""

[Verse 2]
He said the wedding took a year to plan
""You talk about an anxious man, I was nervous
Waitin' on a woman""
And then he nudged my arm like old men do
And said, ""I'll say this about the honeymoon, it was worth it
Waitin' on a woman""

[Pre-Chorus]
""And I don't guess we been anywhere
She hasn't made us late I swear
Sometimes, she does it just 'cause she can do it
Boy, it's just a fact of life
It'll be the same with your young wife
Might as well go on and get used to it""

[Chorus]
""She'll take her time
'Cause you don't mind waitin' on a woman""

[Bridge]
""I've read somewhere statistics show
The man's always the first to go
And that makes sense 'cause I know she won't be ready
So when it finally comes my time
And I get to the other side
I'll find myself a bench, if they've got any""

[Chorus]
""I hope she takes her time
'Cause I don't mind waitin' on a woman
Honey, take your time
'Cause I don't mind waitin' on a woman"""
Brad Paisley,Ticks,"[Verse 1]
Every time you take a sip
In this smoky atmosphere
You press that bottle to your lips
And I wish I was your beer
And in the small there of your back
Your jeans are playing peekaboo
I'd like to see the other half
Of your butterfly tattoo

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, that gives me an idea
Well, let's get out of this bar
Drive out into the country
And find a place to park

[Chorus]
'Cause I'd like to see you out in the moonlight
I'd like to kiss you way back in the sticks
I'd like to walk you through a field of wildflowers
And I'd like to check you for ticks

[Verse 2]
I know the perfect little path
Out in these woods I used to hunt
But don't worry, babe, I've got your back
And I've also got your front
Now, I'd hate to waste a night like this
I'll keep you safe, you wait and see
The only thing allowed to crawl all over you
When we get there is me

[Pre-Chorus]
You know every guy in here tonight
Would like to take you home
But I've got way more class than them
Babe, that ain't what I want

[Chorus]
'Cause I'd like to see you out in the moonlight
I'd like to kiss you way back in the sticks
I'd like to walk you through a field of wildflowers
And I'd like to check you for ticks

[Bridge]
Now, ooh, you never know where one might be
And, ooh, there's lots of place that are hard to reach
I gotcha

[Chorus]
I'd like to see you out in the moonlight
I'd like to kiss you, baby, way back in the sticks
I'd like to walk you through a field of wildflowers
And I'd like to check you for ticks
Oh, I'd sure like to check you for ticks

[Outro]
Come on"
Brad Paisley,Farther Along,"[Verse 1]
Tempted and tried, we're oft made to wonder
Why it should be thus all the day long
While there are others living about us
Never molested, though in the wrong

[Chorus]
Well, farther along, we'll know all about it
Farther along, we'll understand why
Cheer up, my brother, live in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and by

[Verse 2]
When death has come and taken our loved ones
It leaves our home so lonely and drear
And then do we wonder why others prosper
Living so wicked year after year

[Chorus]
Well, farther along, we'll know all about it
Farther along, we'll understand why
Cheer up, my brother, live in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and by

[Verse 3]
When we see Jesus coming in glory
When He comes down from His home in the sky
Then we shall meet Him in that bright mansion
We'll understand it all by and by

[Chorus]
Well, farther along, we'll know all about it
Farther along, we'll understand why
Cheer up, my brothers, live in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and by
Yeah, we'll understand it all by and by"
Brad Paisley,American Saturday Night,"[Intro]
(Whoa oh oh oh)
(Whoa oh oh oh)

[Verse 1]
She's got Brazilian leather boots on the pedal of her German car
Listening to The Beatles singing ""Back in the USSR""
She's going around the world tonight but she ain't leaving here
She's just going to meet her boyfriend down at the street fair

[Chorus]
And it's a French kiss, Italian ice
Spanish moss in the moonlight (whoa oh oh oh)
Just another American Saturday night

[Verse 2]
There's a big toga party tonight down at Delta Chi
They got Canadian bacon on their pizza pie
They got a cooler full of cold Coronas and Amstel Light
It's like we're all living in a big old cup
Just fire up the blender, mix it all up

[Chorus]
It's a French kiss, Italian ice
Margaritas in the moonlight (whoa oh oh oh)
Just another American Saturday night

[Bridge 1]
You know everywhere has something they're known for
Although usually it washes up on our shores
My great-great-great-granddaddy stepped off of that ship
I bet he never ever dreamed we'd have all this

[Bridge 2]
You know everywhere has something they're known for
Although usually it washes up on our shores
Little Italy and Chinatown sitting there side by side
Live from New York (It's Saturday Night!)

[Chorus]
It's a French kiss, Italian ice
Spanish moss in the moonlight (whoa oh oh oh)
Just another American, I'm just another American
And it's just another American Saturday night"
Brad Paisley,Love and War,"[Verse 1: Brad Paisley]
He was nineteen
When he landed at Bagram
Scared and all alone
He lost a leg and a girlfriend
Before he got home

[Chorus: Brad Paisley]
And they say all is fair in Love and War
But that ain't true, it's wrong
They send you off to die for us
Forget about you when you don't

[Verse 2: John Fogerty]
He was nineteen in '68
After all this time
That broken boy is now a broken man
Waitin' in a VA line

[Chorus: John Fogerty]
They say all is fair in Love and War
But that ain't true, it's wrong
They ship you out to die for us
Forget about you when you don't

[Bridge: Brad Paisley & John Fogerty]
And the nightmares
And he's running scared
Far from home
And he wakes up
From a nightmare
He's in another one
He's still not home

[Verse 3: Brad Paisley]
They call 'em decorated heroes
And pin some medals on their chest
Give 'em a tiny little pension
Could we do much less

[Chorus: Brad Paisley & John Fogerty]
They say all is fair in Love and War
But that ain't true, it's wrong
They ship you out to die for us
Forget about you when you don't
They say all is fair in Love and War
But that ain't true, it's wrong
They ship you out to die for us
Forget about you when you don't
They say all is fair in Love and War
But that ain't true, it's wrong
They ship you out to die for us
But forget about you when you don't"
Brad Paisley,Beat This Summer,"[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-ho

[Verse 1]
Like the Ferris wheel goes around and around
Well, the trouble with up is there's always a down
First I'm holding your hand and we're on the boardwalk
There's heaven right here on these streets and these docks

[Verse 2]
But the sun keeps settin', the days go fast
And the sand on the beach is like an hourglass
I can just feel it all slipping away
And babe I can already say that

[Chorus]
As long I live, whatever I do
As great as it is, you know what's a bummer
I ain't ever gonna beat this summer with you
Baby, it's true
The taste of your kiss is so bittersweet
I ain't gonna beat
No way I'm gonna beat this summer with you

[Verse 3]
Before you know it, it's all gonna stop
They'll be rolling up windows and puttin' up tops
Be a cold wind blowin' the leaves through the air
And you won't find a tan line anywhere

[Verse 4]
Baby, I know that it ain't over yet
So let's make the most of what we have left
But it's hard living for this moment we're in and
Knowing it's all gonna end

[Chorus]
And as long I live, whatever I do (whatever I do)
As great as it is, you know what's a bummer
I ain't ever gonna beat this summer with you
Baby, it's true
The taste of your kiss is so bittersweet
I ain't gonna beat
No way I'm gonna beat this summer with you

[Verse 5]
Yeah, looking at you, girl, standing there
Got your Wayfarers on and the sun in your hair
And just like the song in a seashell, you'll be stuck in my mind
Bouncing around in my head
And baby, I can tell

[Chorus]
As long I live (as long as I live), whatever I do (whatever I do)
As great as it is, you know what's a bummer
I ain't ever gonna beat this summer with you
Baby, it's true
The taste of your kiss is so bittersweet
I ain't gonna beat
No way I'm gonna beat this summer with you"
Brad Paisley,Country Nation,"[Verse 1]
We work in the factories and the fields
Assembly lines, the coal mines and the steel mills
That's what we do  but there's more than us than that
If you want to know who we are it's on the logos of our caps

[Chorus]
We're Mountaineers, Volunteers
We're the Tide that rolls, we're Seminoles
We're the herd of long steer
We drive Ford and Chevrolet
Cheer twenty-four and eighty-eight
We crank up our music Friday nights
On two thousand country stations
Yeah, we're one big country nation, that's right

[Verse 2]
We might fix your water pump, your AC
Bring your apple pie, and fill your glass of tea
Take that FedEx package to your door
But underneath that apron or that uniform

[Chorus]
We're Wild Cats, Wolverines
We're Tigers, Buckeyes, Bruins
Bulldogs, Hogs, and Hurricanes
We pray before we race
Cheer fourteen and forty-eight
We drink ice-cold beer on Friday nights
Yeah, we're one big country nation, that's right

[Bridge]
We're all across the map
Down city streets and old dirt roads
We're the fabric of this nation
And we're a nation on our own

[Chorus]
We're Mountaineers, We're Volunteers
We're Devils, Heels, and Rebels
Fighting Irish and Cavaliers
We supe up our Chevrolets
Cheer twenty-four and eighty-eight
And we crank up the same songs Friday night
On two thousand country stations
Yeah, we're one big country nation, that's right"
Brad Paisley,Crushin’ It,"[Verse 1]
I sure could use an attaboy or a big old high five
I'd love to hear ""You're killing it, dude"", yeah, it's been a long time
Since I hit one out of the park, or nailed it as they say
I guess I've been in a dry spell but that's about to change

[Chorus]
'Cause every week has a weekend, by this time Friday night
I'll be done with my third can of cold Bud Light
And I'll be crushin' it, yeah, I'll be crushin' it

[Verse 2]
They say your baby's mad cause you told her that you'd hang some pictures for her
You know the ones she framed late last spring of you and her in Florida
You're up on the ladder when it shatters into smithereens
She shakes her head, looks at you and says
""Ain't you good for anything?"" and you say

[Chorus]
Every week has a weekend, by this time Friday night
You want a margarita, I'll get Tequila and ice
And I'll be crushin' it, with a cold one in my other hand
I'll be crushin' it, when I'm finished with my can
I can stomp it with my boot, clench it with my fist
Smash it on my forehead, yeah I got this
I'll be crushin' it, oh, I'll be crushin' it
Oh

[Bridge]
I figured this out in college, walking past them Gothic columns
That I was gonna probably wind up somewhere near the bottom
I was never gonna be the best and brightest guy around
But like the great George freakin Strait, I'm the king of getting unwound

[Chorus]
And every week has a weekend, by this time Friday night
I'll be done with my third can of cold Bud Light
And I'll be crushin' it, every weekend's a weekend
Yeah, I'll be crushin' it, by this time Friday night
I'll be crushin' it, I'll be done with my third can
Oh, I'll be crushin' it, of cold Bud Light
I'll be crushin' it, I'll be crushin' it"
Brad Paisley,The Medicine Will,"They sell their lies by the bottle
Without an ounce of shame
A promise on a slip of paper
Guaranteed to dull the pain

We dug that mine a mile below us
And built up this little town
Oh and we're still digging holes
But these are six feet down

There's coal under the mountains
And gold in them there pills
If living here don't kill you
The medicine will

Well these are good God-fearing people
Just doing the bеst they can
And if the devil's in thе details
Then hell's in milligrams

For every family visitation
Sons and daughters gone too soon
The drugstore and the undertaker
The only businesses that boom

There's coal under the mountains
And gold in them there pills
If living here don't kill you
The medicine will

Now it's all broken dreams and plywood
Up and down these haunted streets
Even the bar where we all used to go
I guess even whiskey can't compete

But I believe way down below us
Deeper than that mine shaft runs
There's a place for those who did this to us
And it's hotter than the sun

Coal under the mountains
And gold in them there pills
If living here don't kill you
The medicine will"
Luke Combs,Dive,"[Verse 1]
Oh, maybe I came on too strong
Maybe I waited too long
Maybe I played my cards wrong
Oh, just a little bit wrong
Baby I apologize for it

[Pre-Chorus]
I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hangin' on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And jumpin' in harder than
Ten thousand rocks on the lake

[Chorus]
So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
Don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you

[Verse 2]
You're a mystery
I have travelled the world
And there's no other girl like you
No one, what's your history? (What's your history?)
Do you have a tendency to lead some people on?
'Cause I heard you do, mmh

[Pre-Chorus]
I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And lie awake, every day
Don't know how much I can take

[Chorus]
So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
Don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you

[Bridge]
I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hangin' on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
Sittin' back, lookin' at
Every mess that I made

[Chorus]
So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
Don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you
Before I dive right into you
Before I dive right into you"
Luke Combs,Forever After All,"[Verse 1]
A cold beer's got twelve ounces
A good truck's got maybe three hundred thousand
You only get so much until it's gone
Duracells in a Maglite
A needle drop on a forty-five
Are the kinda things that only last so long

[Pre-Chorus]
When the new wears off, and they get to gettin' old
Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

[Chorus]
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all

[Verse 2]
The FM station on the outskirts
Blue jeans after years of shift work
All fadin' out like I always knew they would
The strings on this guitar
The first love lost on a young heart
Those things are gonna break after the getting's good

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause the new wears off and they get to gettin' old
Yeah, sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

[Chorus]
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
And I know there'll be that moment
The good Lord calls one of us home and
One won't have the other by their side
But Heaven knows it, that won't last too long
Maybe some things last forever after all

[Outro]
After all"
Luke Combs,Hurricane,"[Verse 1]
Hadn't had a good time since you know when
Got talked into goin' out with hopes you were stayin' in
I was feelin' like myself for the first time in a long time
Until I bumped into some of your friends over there talkin' to mine

[Chorus]
Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doin' alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin’
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain' was drivin’, thunder, lightnin'
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

[Verse 2]
Knew it was gonna be a long night
From the moment when
We locked eyes over whiskey on ice
Started talkin' 'bout us again
If I woulda just laid my drink down
And walked out
I wouldn't be in my truck
Driving us to your house

[Chorus]
But you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doin' alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin’
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain' was drivin’, thunder, lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

[Bridge]
A Category 5
With your smile
Blew me away
And girl it ain't but midnight
You done killed the lights
Bent my heart back to your bedside

[Chorus]
Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin'
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane"
Luke Combs,Beautiful Crazy,"[Verse 1]
Her day starts with a coffee and ends with a wine
Takes forever getting ready so she's never on time for anything
When she gets that ""come get me"" look in her eyes
Well, it kinda scares me, the way that she drives me wild
When she drives me wild

[Chorus]
Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me

[Verse 2]
She makes plans for the weekend, can't wait to go out
Till she changes her mind
Says, ""Let's stay on the couch and watch TV""
And she falls asleep

[Chorus]
Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me

[Bridge]
She's unpredictable, unforgettable
It's unusual, unbelievable
How I'm such a fool, yeah, I'm such a fool for her

[Chorus]
Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy, she's crazy, she's crazy
But her crazy's beautiful to me
Her crazy's beautiful to me"
Luke Combs,When It Rains It Pours,"[Verse 1]
Sunday morning
Man, she woke up fightin' mad
Bitchin' and moanin' on and on
'Bout the time I had
And by Tuesday you could say
That girl was good as gone
Then when Thursday came around I was all alone
So I went for a drive to clear my mind
Ended up at a Shell on I-65

[Chorus 1]
Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
I bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day, three night beach vacation
Deep sea señorita fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours

[Verse 2]
Now she was sure real quick to up and apologize
When she heard about my newfound luck
On that FM dial
And it's crazy how lately now
It just seems to come in waves
What I thought was gonna be the death of me
Was my saving grace
It's got me thinking that her leaving
Is the only logical reason

[Chorus 2]
That I got the last spot in the Hooters' parking lot
And the waitress left her number on my check with a heart
She picked up on the first ring when I gave her a call
And I only spent five bucks at the Moose Club raffle
Won a used 4-wheeler and three free passes
For me and two of my buddies to play a round of golf
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours

[Bridge]
Well I've been on one hell of a redneck roll
For three weeks now
And it all started on the day that she walked out

[Chorus 1]
Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
Bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
And I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day, three night beach vacation
Deep sea señorita fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours"
Luke Combs,Better Together,"[Verse 1]
A 40 HP Johnson on a flat bottom metal boat
Coke cans and BB guns, barbed wire and old fence posts
8-point bucks in autumn and freshly cut cornfields
One arm out the window and one hand on the wheel

[Chorus]
Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here

[Verse 2]
Your license in my wallet when we go out downtown
Your lipstick's stained every coffee cup that I got in this house
The way you say, ""I love you, too"" is like rain on an old tin roof
And your hand fits right into mine like a needle in a groove

[Chorus]
Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here

[Bridge]
Sometimes we're oil and water
But I wouldn't have it any other way
And if I'm being honest
Your first and my last name

[Chorus]
Would just sound better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here
And me, as long as you're right here"
Luke Combs,She Got the Best of Me,"[Verse 1]
Seventeen, you don't think that much about life
You just live it
Like kerosene dancing around a fire
But you're in it

[Pre-Chorus]
So you jump right in
Ain't afraid to fall
And you give it all

[Chorus]
She got the best of me
She broke my heart
Now all that's left of me
Is beating in this guitar
Every night, a different town
She follows me around
So you get what's left of me
Yeah, you get what's left of me
'Cause she got the best of me

[Verse 2]
I picked myself up off the floor
And found something new worth living for
And a old dusty hand-me-down six-string
And a couple chords

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm getting over her
A little more with every song
So y'all sing along

[Chorus]
She got the best of me
She broke my heart
Now all that's left of me
Is beating in this guitar
Every night, a different town
She follows me around
So you get what's left of me
Yeah, you get what's left of me
'Cause she got the best of me

[Chorus]
She got the best of me
She broke my heart
Now all that's left of me
Is beating in this guitar
Every night, a different town
She follows me around
So you get what's left of me
Yeah, you get what's left of me
'Cause she got the best of me

[Outro]
She got the best of me
She got the best of me
She got the best of me"
Luke Combs,One Number Away,"[Verse 1]
Are you sitting at home, all alone, trying to fall asleep?
Are you staring a hole through your phone, praying that it rings?
Are you watching a movie that you've seen a thousand times?
Or maybe playing some Mayer, getting lost in your favorite lines

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes
To drown out the noise
But I just wanna hear your voice

[Chorus]
I’m one number away
From calling to you
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl, I confess
I lied when I said
""I'm leaving and not coming back""
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away

[Verse 2]
Are you stuck at a red light with a Marlboro Light on your lips?
Does the smoke in your mirror get clearer without my kiss?
Are you changing the station replacing our favorite songs?
Well maybe it's a mistake, hit the brakes on the moving on

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes
To outrun the storm
But I'm almost out that door

[Chorus]
And I'm one number away
From calling to you
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl, I confess
I lied when I said
""I'm leaving and not coming back""
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away

[Bridge]
Will you pick up when I call?
Or just forget we loved at all
We don't have to talk
I just wanna hear your voice

[Chorus]
And I'm one number away
From calling you
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl, I confess
I lied when I said
""I'm leaving and not coming back""
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away

[Outro]
Away, away
Yeah I'm still one number away"
Luke Combs,Fast Car,"[Verse 1]
You got a fast car
And I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Startin' from zero, got nothin' to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothin' to prove

[Verse 2]
You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
Been workin' at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just across the bordеr and into the city
And you and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it means to bе livin'

[Verse 3]
See, my old man's got a problem
He live in the bottle, that's the way it is
He said his body's too old for workin'
His body's too young to look like his
So Mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, ""Somebody's gotta take care of him""
So I quit school and that's what I did

[Refrain]
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
Still gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
I, I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

[Verse 4]
You got a fast car
We go cruisin', entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
So I work in the market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
And we'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house, live in the suburbs

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
I, I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

[Verse 5]
You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinkin' late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me'd find it
I got no plans, I ain't goin' nowhere
Take your fast car and keep on driving

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
I, I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

[Instrumental Break]

[Refrain]
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
Still gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way"
Luke Combs,I Know She Ain’t Ready,"[Verse 1]
You were wearing that black dress
Coat, and cowboy boots
He was there, but I didn't care
I was too busy staring at you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
In the pouring rain, with the blue lights flashin'
In the hills of Appalachian
Close to tears with your makeup smeared
I asked you what had happened

[Chorus 1]
But I know she ain't ready
She won't be for awhile
And he broke her down
And when I'm around
I can see it in her smile
She's fightin' getting closer
It's just too plain to see
And I know she ain't ready
But that's alright with me

[Verse 2]
You were wearing that red dress
Pearls, and those high heels
Liked the way it made you look
You love the way it made you feel

[Pre-Chorus 2]
So I said to you
""I'd sure love to do this again""
And you said ""Me too
But I'm just not over him""

[Chorus 1]
And I know she ain't ready
She won't be for awhile
And he broke her down
And when I'm around
I can see it in her smile
She's fightin' getting closer
It's just too plain to see
And I know she ain't ready
But that's alright with me, yeah

[Pre-Chorus 3]
She started calling me baby, and two years later
I was down on one knee
With a ring in hand, I said
""I'm your man, and girl, will you marry me?""

[Chorus 2]
She said, ""You know that I'm ready
And I have been for awhile
When the bells sound and you turn around
I'll be walking down the aisle
This will only bring us closer
It's just too plain to see
And I know that we're ready
So that's alright with me
That's alright with me"""
Luke Combs,Ain’t No Love in Oklahoma,"[Verse 1]
I keep chasing that same old devil
Down the same old dead-end highway
Riding that storm running through my veins
Like a shot down tailspun airplane
Scared of nothing and I'm scared to death
I can't breathe and I catch my breath
But I keep chasing that same old devil
Down the same old dead-end highway

[Chorus]
Ain't no love in Oklahoma
Just the whistle of a long black train
You'll know when it's coming for ya
Riding in on the wind and rain

[Verse 2]
I got saved in the same Red River
The same Red River tryna drown me
It ain't knocking me down, I'm standing my ground
With the whole world falling all around me
I keep running, but I'm standing still
Pray for peace, but I need thе thrill
So I keep chasing that same old devil
Down the samе old dead-end highway

[Chorus]
Ain't no love in Oklahoma
Just the whistle of a long black train
You'll know when it's coming for ya
Riding in on the wind and rain

[Chorus]
Ain't no love in Oklahoma
Just the whistle of a long black train
You'll know when it's coming for ya
Riding in on the wind and rain
Ain't no love in Oklahoma
Just the whistle of a long black train
You'll know when it's coming for ya
Riding in on the wind and rain"
Luke Combs,Even Though I’m Leaving,"[Verse 1]
Daddy, I'm afraid, won't you stay a little while?
Keep me safe 'cause there's monsters right outside
Daddy, please don't go, I don't wanna be alone
'Cause the second that you're gone they're gonna know
Before he went to bed he grabbed my hand and said

[Chorus]
Just 'cause I'm leavin'
It don't mean that I won't be right by your side
When you need me
And you can't see me in the middle of the night
Just close your eyes and say a prayer
It's okay, I know you're scared when I'm not here
But I'll always be right there
Even though I'm leavin', I ain't goin' nowhere

[Verse 2]
Dad, we'll be late, and Uncle Sam don't like to wait
He's got a big old plane that's gonna take me far away
I know I act tough, but there's a churnin' in my gut
'Cause I just can't call you up when things get rough
Before I left, he hugged my neck and said

[Chorus]
Just 'cause you're leavin'
It don't mean that I won't be right by your side
When you need me
And you can't see me in the middle of the night
Just close your eyes and say a prayer
It's okay, I know you're scared I might be here
But I'll always be right there
Even though you're leavin', I ain't goin' nowhere

[Bridge]
Daddy, I'm afraid, won't you stay a little while?
I never thought I'd see the day I had to say goodbye
Daddy, please don't go, I can't do this on my own
There's no way that I can walk this road alone
Daddy grabbed my hand and said

[Chorus]
Just 'cause I'm leavin'
It don't mean that I won't be right by your side
When you need me
And you can't see me in the middle of the night
Just close your eyes and say a prayer
It's okay, boy, I ain't scared
I won't be here, but I'll always be right there
Even though I'm leavin', I ain't goin' nowhere
I ain't goin' nowhere"
Luke Combs,5 Leaf Clover,"[Verse 1]
Well, I go to work every Monday
Get to do something I love
And I make it home every evening
To an angel God sent from above
Got an eight point on camera from last year
That this season looks like a ten
I got a barn with a fridge full of cold beer
On the weekend it's full of good friends

[Chorus]
I know I'm a lucky man, but I ain't sure why I am
'Cause it ain't like anyone deserves the world in the palm of their hand
Now I hit my knees, thankful as can be
But the one thing I can't get over
How'd a guy like me, who'd have been fine with three
Wind up with a five-leaf clover?

[Verse 2]
I got a half ton that's parked in the driveway
My dog wags his tail when he hears
I grew up in a good place to be from
My folks still got a bunch of good years

[Chorus]
Now I know I'm a lucky man, but I ain't sure why I am
'Cause it ain't like anyone deserves the world in the palm of their hand
Now I hit my knees, thankful as can be
But the one thing I can't get over
How'd a guy like me, who'd have been fine with three
Wind up with a five-leaf clover?

[Chorus]
I know I'm a lucky man, but I ain't sure why I am
'Cause it ain't like anyone deserves the world in the palm of their hand
Now I hit my knees, thankful as can be
But the one thing I can't get over
How'd a guy like me, who'd have been fine with three
Wind up with a five-leaf clover?

[Outro]
How'd a guy like me, who could've wound up with weeds
Wind up with a five-leaf clover?"
Luke Combs,The Kind of Love We Make,"[Verse 1]
We've been burnin' both ends
Keepin' the lights on
So I've been thinkin' we need
A little time alone

[Pre-Chorus]
So what you say we cancel our plans?
Tonight I'm only gonna be your man

[Chorus]
Let's get some candles burning
And some records turning
All the lights down low
Take it nice and slow
The way your body's moving
Keep doing what you're doing to me all night long
Writin' our love song
Girl, I want it, gotta have it
Let the passion take us to a higher place
Makin' the kind of love we make

[Verse 2]
There ain't no way, baby
To get me out this house
When you look this good
What could I even think about? Oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Besides turn around and lockin' the door
Watching your red dress fall to the floor

[Chorus]
Let's get some candles burning
And some records turning
All the lights down low
Take it nice and slow
The way your body's moving
Keep doing what you're doing to me all night long
Writin' our love song
Girl, I want it, gotta have it
Let the passion take us to a higher place
Makin' the kind of love we make

[Bridge]
Kind of love we make

[Pre-Chorus]
So what you say we cancel our plans?
Tonight I'm only gonna be your man

[Chorus]
Let's get some candles burning
Some records turning
All the lights down low
Take it nice and slow
The way your body's moving
Keep doing what you're doing to me all night long
Writin' our love song
Girl, I want it, gotta have it
Let the passion take us to a higher place
Girl, I want it, gotta have it
Let the passion take us to a higher place
Makin' the kind of love we make
Kind of love we make
Makin' the kind of love we make"
Luke Combs,The Man He Sees in Me,"[Verse 1]
He's Spiderman in Walmart boots and a camouflage hat
With a baby blue Zebco that gets hung up every cast
He thinks he’s learning fishing from the man that taught Bill Dance
And I think as I untangle it and put it in his hands

[Chorus]
I hope he never finds out that I didn't hang the moon
And I've never scared a monster out the closet in his room
One day between him leavin’ home and drivin' on my knee
Maybe I'll finally be, the man he sees in me

[Verse 2]
He waves that blanket like the checkered flag pullin' offa the interstate
With a Happy Meal cup held high like I won the big race
When we get home, his mind is blown when I untie his shoes
And he smiles and says, ""Daddy, there ain't nothin' you can't do""

[Chorus]
Well, I hope he never finds out that I didn't hang the moon
And I’ve never scared a monster out the closet of his room
Some day between him leavin’ home and drivin' on my knee
But maybe I’ll finally be, the man he sees in me

[Instrumental]

Well, I know he's gonna find out that I didn't hang the moon
And there never was a monster in the closet of his room
Some day when he's drivin’ home with his son on his knee
Well, I hope he's tryna be, the man he sees in me

[Outro]
The man he sees in me
The man he sees in me"
Luke Combs,Must’ve Never Met You,"[Verse 1]
Just pick yourself up, dust yourself off, they say it ain't that hard
But just puttin' one foot in front of the other ain't gettin' me too far
This movin' on ain't comin' along the way they said it would

[Chorus]
I guess whoever said ""the grass is greener"" must've never seen the other side
And ""what don't kill you makes you stronger"" sure sounds like a lie
And whoever said that ""time heals everything and everything will be alright""
Whoever said ""it ain't the end of the world and you'll find somebody new”
Must've never met you

[Verse 2]
Must've never heard you say you'd never leave me then watch you walk away
Must've never fell as hard as I did 'cause then they wouldn't say
""Maybe it wasn't meant to be, yeah maybe you're better off alone""

[Chorus]
I guess whoever said ""the grass is greener"" must've never seen the other side
And ""what don't kill you makes you stronger"" sure sounds like a lie
And whoever said that ""time heals everything and everything will be alright""
Whoever said ""it ain't the end of the world and you'll find somebody new""
Must've never met you
Must've never met you

[Bridge]
""Maybe it wasn't meant to be, yeah maybe you're better off alone""

[Chorus]
Whoever said ""the grass is greener""
Must've never seen the other side
""What don't kill you makes you stronger""
Still sounds like a lie
And whoever said that ""time heals everything and everything will be alright""
Whoever said ""it ain't the end of the world, you know she ain't the only girl""
""You win, you lose, you find somebody new""
Must've never met you
Oh, must've never met you
Hey, must've never met you"
Luke Combs,Does To Me,"[Verse 1: Luke Combs]
I was a third-string dreamer on a second-place team
But I was hell on wheels with a full head of steam
When coach put me in
And I'm still proud of that hit
I was a last resort to go to prom with the queen
Thanks to an ex-boyfriend who broke her heart that week
No, I didn't get lucky
But I still felt like a king
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

[Chorus: Luke Combs]
So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving, average Joe
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

[Verse 2: Luke Combs]
I was the one phone call when my brother went to jail
Pawned my guitar just to pay his bail
No, I'll never get it back
But I'm okay with that
I was the first man standing next to my best friend
The day the love of his life said ""I do"" to him
I was a couple beers deep
But I still remembered that speech
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

[Chorus: Luke Combs]
So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving, average Joe
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

[Bridge: Eric Church]
There's a worn-out blade that my granddaddy gave me
My mama's first Bible, Daddy's Don Williams vinyl
That first-fish-catching Zebco thirty-three
Well, that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

[Chorus: Luke Combs & Eric Church]
So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving average Joe (Average Joe)
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And I'm a damn hard working
One thing's for certain
I stand up for what I believe (For what I believe)
That might not mean much to you
But it does to me
Yeah, it does to me
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

[Outro: Eric Church]
Oh, it does to me
Oh man, it does to me"
Luke Combs,What You See Is What You Get,"[Verse 1]
I'm a puzzle
I'm a walking contradiction
In far from mint condition
'Cause there's pieces I can't find
Sometimes trouble
A can of Coke a day addiction
With set in stone convictions
And an open bottom line

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm an easy read but I ain't no open book
Got a knack for making things harder than they look

[Chorus]
I'm a straight shootin'
Beer drinkin', rule breakin'
Don't think I won't take a good thing too far
I'm a midnightin', backslidin'
Getaway car drivin'
Runnin' away with your heart
I guess be careful what you wish for is all I meant when I said
""What you see is what you get""

[Verse 2]
At least I'm honest
I don't spin it like a record
And I ain't acting like I'm better
Than you know I really am
Yeah, you're dead on it
You got me figured, I'll admit it
Set in my ways hard-headed
But hell, I do the best I can

[Chorus]
I'm a straight shootin'
Beer drinkin', rule breakin'
Don't think I won't take a good thing too far
I'm a midnightin', backslidin'
Getaway car drivin'
Runnin' away with your heart
I guess be careful what you wish for is all I meant when I said
""What you see is what you get""

[Bridge]
With me ain't no tricks up these sleeves
An acquired taste, a constant work in progress

[Chorus]
I'm a straight shootin'
Beer drinkin', rule breakin'
Don't think I won't take a good thing too far
I'm a midnightin', backslidin'
Getaway car drivin'
Runnin' away with your heart
I guess be careful what you wish for is all I meant when I said
What you see is what you get
What you see is what you get"
Luke Combs,Where The Wild Things Are,"[Verse 1]
My big brother rode an Indian Scout
It was black like his jacket
American Spirit hangin' outta his mouth
Just like our daddy
He kick-started that bike one night and broke mama's heart
He pointed that headlight West, out where the wild things are

[Verse 2]
He'd call me up every couple of weeks
From South California
Talk about the desert and the Joshua Tree
And his pretty girl stories
And how he bought an Airstream trailer and a J-45 guitar
Said, ""Little brother, you'd love it out here, out where the wild things are""

[Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh, it's hearts on fire and crazy dreams
Oh, oh-oh, the nights ignite like gasoline
And light up those streets that never sleep when the sky goes dark
Out where the wild things are

[Verse 3]
I called my brother from the back of that plane
The second I made it
We started drinkin' on the strip in L.A
And then it got crazy
Ended up at a house in the hills with some Hollywood stars
Kissin' on a blonde in a backyard pool, out where the wild things are
(Oh, yeah)

[Bridge]
Couple iron horse rebels
Wild as the devil
I knew I had to move back East
Said goodbye to my brother
At the end of that summer
But I knew he'd never leave

[Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh, it's hearts on fire and crazy dreams
Oh, where the nights ignite like gasoline
And oh, oh-oh, them Indian Scouts, man, they're built for speed
And oh, oh-oh, they said he hit that guard rail at half past three
Lit up those streets that never sleep when the sky goes dark
We buried him out in the wind 'neath the West Coast stars
Out where the wild things are

[Outro]
Out where the wild things are"
Luke Combs,"Houston, We Got a Problem","[Verse 1]
This is my kinda town
This is my kinda place
I wouldn't mind hangin' 'round
For more than just a couple days
I got a 12th floor room
With a killer view
Of the empty Astrodome
Got a tab at the bar downstairs
But all I can think about is home

[Chorus]
I got my new boots covered in red dirt
A ""Don't Mess With Texas"" t-shirt
And a Lonestar postcard postmarked with ""Missin' you""
It's got the biggest sky you've ever seen
The coldest beer you'd ever drink
But I still feel like I landed on the moon
'Cause it ain't got you
Houston, we got a problem

[Verse 2]
You should've seen 19th Street
You should've seen a midnight rodeo
The way them saloon doors swing
When they line dance to ""Copperhead Road""
Something 'bout the air down here
That'll make you feel
The way all them cowboys do
I wish I was an outlaw
But all I can think about is you

[Chorus]
I got my new boots covered in red dirt
A ""Don't Mess With Texas"" t-shirt
And a Lonestar postcard postmarked with ""Missin' you""
It's got the biggest sky you've ever seen
The coldest beer you'd ever drink
But I still feel like I landed on the moon
'Cause it ain't got you
Houston, we got a problem

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus/Outro]
It's got the biggest sky you've ever seen
The coldest beer you'd ever drink
But I still feel like I landed on the moon
'Cause it ain't got you
Houston, we got a problem
Houston, we got a problem
Houston, we got a problem"
Luke Combs,Used to You,"[Verse 1]
That old phone of mine, 2:39
A.M. when I got the call
Half asleep
Thought it was a dream
But it wasn’t after all
That old dog of yours
Sitting on the porch
Waits for you to come home
Little does he know
That you won’t
Be walking through that door

[Pre-Chorus]
I just leave him alone
Cause letting go don’t come that easily
Most of the time, I can get by
It’s just a little hard on me

[Chorus]
But I’m getting used to that old truck of yours
Sitting out in the drive
I’m getting used to you not being there
At church on Sunday night
I’m getting used to the radio playing
Without you singing along
But I’ll never get used to you being gone

[Verse 2]
That old rocking chair
Sitting over there
It don’t rock no more
And that old six string
Ain't played a thing
Been awhile since it’s hummed a chord

[Pre-Chorus]
I just leave 'em alone cause letting go
Don’t come that easily
Most of the time
I can get by
It’s just a little hard on me

[Chorus]
But I’m getting used to that old truck of yours
Sitting out in the drive
I’m getting used to you not being there
At church on Sunday night
I’m getting used to the radio playing
Without you singing along
But I’ll never get used to you being gone

[Bridge]
There’s a lot of things in this 'ole world I can stand
But when it comes to losing you
I just can’t

[Chorus 2]
Yeah, I’m getting used to that old truck of yours
Sitting out in the drive
I’m getting used to you not being there
At church on Sunday night
I’m getting used to the radio playing
Without you singing along
But I'll never get used to
No, I’ll never get used to you being gone

[Outro]
Yeah, being gone
I’m never getting used to you being gone"
Luke Combs,Can I Get an Outlaw?,"[Verse 1]
Back in the day it was a six gun and a six-string
Man, that was country
And that's the way country still oughta be
It was lived, not taught, it was earned, not bought
Had to put in the work to get to the top
Let me tell you what I thinks really gone wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
These days it's all wannabes singin' someone else's songs
Everybody's doing the same damn thing
Where have the rebels gone?

[Chorus]
'Cause we don't need another pretty boy, singin' pretty songs
Fake country boys, doin' country all wrong
We need another Haggard, or a Johnny Cash
Somebody chewin' 'baccer and whippin' ass
I need preacher, I need a savior, how 'bout y'all?
Can I get an outlaw?

[Verse 2]
It don't have to be honkytonks, boots, and Wrangler jeans
It ain't the banjo or the fiddle, no
It's the words and what they mean
If you gonna talk the talk, you better walk the walk
And brother, that's the truth
So honestly, what would Waylon do?

[Pre-Chorus]
I can guarantee that if he was alive today
He'd ask us one more time
""Hoss, you sure Hank done it this way?""

[Chorus]
We don't need another pretty boy, singin' pretty songs
Fake country boys, doin' country all wrong
We need another Haggard, or a Johnny Cash
Somebody chewin' 'baccer and whippin' ass
I need preacher, I need a savior, how 'bout y'all?
Can I get an outlaw?

[Bridge]
Are the good times really gone for good
Or can we get back to our roots?
It's about damn time we raise the bar
So raise a glass if you feel like I do

[Chorus]
'Cause we don't need another pretty boy, singin' pretty songs
Fake country boys, doin' country all wrong
We need another Haggard, or a Johnny Cash
Somebody chewin' tobacco, and whippin' ass
I need preacher, I need a savior, how 'bout y'all?
And I pray country answers my call
Can I get an outlaw?
Oh, can I get an outlaw?"
Luke Combs,This One’s For You,"[Verse 1]
There’s a couple people that I owe a beer or two
And three or four I owe more than a few
For all the times I couldn’t find the answers
Stumbling through the dark without a clue
This one’s for you

[Verse 2]
Mom and daddy always did their best
For a crazy fool who couldn’t help himself
I thank God they were there to see me through
This one’s for you

[Chorus]
I told you all I’d write you a song (Song, song, song)
Pour my heart in the melody
To keep you singing along (Singing along, singing along)
This might not be the right time
These might not be the right lines to prove
For sayin' what I’m tryin' to
But this one’s for you

[Verse 3]
I’ve been knocked down time and time again
Got picked back up by love and few good friends
Who reminded me of all I stood to lose
This one’s for you

[Chorus]
Yeah I told you all I’d write you a song (Song, song)
Pour my heart in the melody
To keep you singing along (Singing along, singing along)
This might not be the right time
These might not be the right lines to prove
For sayin' what I’m tryin' to
This one’s for you

(Oh, yee-eeah)
Uuu-uuu-uuu-uu-uu

[Bridge]
Made more than my fair share of the same mistakes
Bridges burned and lessons learned
A few things that I can’t change
Some apologies are way past overdue
So this one’s for you

[Chorus]
Wow, I told you all I’d write you a song (Song, song)
Pour my heart in the melody
To keep you singing along (Singing along, singing along)
This might not be the right time (Time, time)
And these might not be the right lines to prove (To prove)
For saying what I’m trying to
This one’s for you

[Outro]
There’s a couple people that I owe a beer or two
And three or four I owe more than a few"
Luke Combs,Cold As You,"[Verse 1]
It's a junked out joint off a backroad
A blinkin' window sign with an arrow
A gravel Iot chock full o' toolbox trucks
Makin' their happy hour way home

[Pre-Chorus]
When guys like me lose girls like you
That's where we run to

[Chorus]
They got ""Whiskey River"" on the jukebox
A honky tonk sawdust dance floor
A neon, five o'clock, pro clock
And plenty damn many when you want one more
This broke-heart fool on an old bar stool
Drinkin' beer almost as cold as you

[Verse 2]
Bunch of good time numbers on the stall door
A picture o' you on the dart board
Them cinder block walls ain't ever been cleaned
Still ain't as dirty as you done me

[Chorus]
""Whiskey River"" on the jukebox
A honky-tonk sawdust dance floor
A neon, five o'clock, pro clock
And plenty damn many when you want one more
This broke-heart fool on an old bar stool
Drinkin' beer almost as cold as you

[Instrumental]

[Pre-Chorus]
When guys like me lose girls like you
That's where we run to

[Chorus]
We got ""Whiskey River"" on a jukebox
A honky-tonk sawdust dance floor
A neon, five o'clock, pro clock
And plenty damn many when you want one more
This broke-heart fool on an old bar stool
Drinkin' beer almost as cold as you

Cold as you"
Luke Combs,Huntin’ By Yourself,"[Verse 1]
He ran outta that bedroom 'bout as gung-ho as he could be in his Mossy Oak
Took a first hunt picture on my phone 'fore he fell asleep on the way
I held the gun, he held the light
A cup of coffee and a can of Sprite
The stand was only ten feet high but on top of the world that day

[Pre-Chorus]
I already knew he wouldn't see a thing
Been three more times and it's always the same

[Chorus]
'Cause he moves too much and he talks too loud
But I don't mind 'cause I'm findin' out
That even if it's just time we're killin', it's never felt more like livin'
They'll make you cuss and wear your patience thin
But next thing you know, they're all grown up and then
You're huntin' by yourself again

[Verse 2]
Well I've heard 'em say these days don't last
I know the years are gonna fly fast
Right out the door and never come back
As bad as you want 'em to
And pretty soon, he'll sit in his own tree
Be a bat outta hell with a set of keys
And chasin' girls is gonna be all he'll wanna do

[Pre-Chorus]
He'll have a lot less time for his old man
So I'm gonna soak it up while I still can

[Chorus]
When he moves too much and he talks too loud
But I don't mind 'cause I'm findin' out
That even if it's just time we're killin', it's never felt more like livin'
They'll make you cuss and wear your patience thin
But next thing you know, they're all grown up and then
You're huntin' by yourself again

[Bridge]
Runs outta that bedroom 'bout as gung-ho as he could be in his Mossy Oak
Hop in the truck and off we go
I can't help but smile 'cause he don't know

[Chorus]
He moves too much and he talks too loud
But I don't mind 'cause I'm findin' out
That even if it's just time we're killin', it's never felt more like livin'
They'll make you cuss and wear your patience thin
But next thing you know, they're all grown up and then
You're huntin' by yourself again"
Linda Ronstadt,Blue Bayou,"[Verse 1]
I feel so bad, I got a worried mind
I'm so lonesome all the time
Since I left my baby behind
On Blue Bayou

[Pre-Chorus]
Saving nickels, saving dimes
Working 'til the sun don't shine
Looking forward to happier times
On Blue Bayou

[Chorus]
I'm going back someday
Come what may to Blue Bayou
Where the folks are fun
And the world is mine on Blue Bayou
Where those fishing boats with their sails afloat
If I could only see
That familiar sunrise through sleepy eyes
How happy I'd be

[Verse 2]
Gonna see my baby again
Gonna be with some of my friends
Maybe I'll feel better again
On Blue Bayou

[Pre-Chorus]
Saving nickels, saving dimes
Working 'til the sun don't shine
Looking forward to happier times
On Blue Bayou

[Chorus]
I'm going back someday
Come what may to Blue Bayou
Where the folks are fun
And the world is mine on Blue Bayou
Where those fishing boats with their sails afloat
If I could only see
That familiar sunrise through sleepy eyes
How happy I'd be

[Instrumental Break]
[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Oh, that boy of mine by my side
The silver moon
And the evening tide
Oh, some sweet day gonna take away
This hurting inside

[Outro]
Well, I'll never be blue
My dreams come true
On Blue Bayou"
Linda Ronstadt,"Long, Long Time","[Verse 1]
Love will abide
Take things in stride
Sounds like good advice
But there's no one at my side

[Pre-Chorus]
And time washes clean
Love's wounds unseen
That's what someone told me
But I don't know what it means

[Chorus]
'Cause I've done everything I know
To try and make you mine
And I think I'm gonna love you
For a long, long time

[Verse 2]
Caught in my fears
Blinking back the tears
I can't say you hurt me
When you never let me near

[Pre-Chorus]
And I never drew
One response from you
All the while you fell
All over girls you never knew

[Chorus]
'Cause I've done everything I know
To try and make you mine
And I think it's going to hurt me
For a long, long time

[Verse 3]
Wait for the day
You'll go away
Knowing that you warned me
Of the price I'd have to pay

[Pre-Chorus]
And life's full of flaws
Who knows the cause?
Living in the memory
Of a love that never was

[Chorus]
'Cause I've done everything I know
To try and change your mind
And I think I'm going to miss you
For a long, long time
'Cause I've done everything I know
To try and make you mine
And I think I'm gonna love you
For a long, long time"
Linda Ronstadt,You’re No Good,"[Verse 1]
Feeling better now that we're through
Feeling better 'cause I'm over you
I learned my lesson, it left a scar
Now I see how you really are

[Chorus]
You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Baby, you're no good
I'm gonna say it again
You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Baby, you're no good

[Verse 2]
I broke a heart that's gentle and true
Well, I broke a heart over someone like you
I'll beg his forgiveness on bended knee
I wouldn't blame him if he said to me

[Chorus]
You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Baby, you're no good
I'm gonna say it again
You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Baby, you're no good

I'm turning you down, baby, and I'm going my way
Forget about you, baby, 'cause I'm leaving to stay

Linda Ronstadt,Willin’,"[Verse 1]
I been warped by the rain, driven by the snow
I'm drunk and dirty, don't you know, but I'm still willin'
Out on the road late last night
I'd see my pretty Alice in every headlight, Alice, Dallas Alice

[Chorus]
And I've been from Tucson to Tucumcari, Tehachapi to Tonopah
Driven every kind of rig that's ever been made
Driven the backroads so I wouldn't get weighed
And if you give me weed, whites and wine
And you show me a sign
And I'll be willin' to be movin'

[Verse 2]
And I've been kicked by the wind, robbed by the sleet
Had my head stove in, but I'm still on my feet and I'm still willin'
And I smuggled some smokes and folks from Mexico
Baked by the sun every time I go to Mexico, ah, but I'm still

[Chorus]
And I've been from Tucson to Tucumcari, Tehachapi to Tonopah
Driven every kind of rig that's ever been made
Driven the backroads so I wouldn't get weighed
And if you give me weed, whites and wine
And you show me a sign
And I'll be willin' to be movin'"
Linda Ronstadt,Tumbling Dice,"People try to rape me
Always think I'm crazy
Make me burn the candle right down
Baby I can't stay
I don't need your jewels in my frown

Now all you women are low-down gamblers
Cheating like I don't know how
Baby I go crazy
There's fever in the funkhouse now

Well this low-down bitching
Got my poor feet a-itching
Can't you see the deuce is still wild
Baby get it straight
You got to roll me
And call me the tumbling dice

Always in a hurry
Never stop to worry
Can't see the time passing by
Honey got no money
I'm sixes and sevens and nines

Well hey now baby I'm the rank outsider
You can be my partner in crime
Baby get it straight
You got to roll me
Call me the tumbling dice

I said my my my
I'm the lone crapshooter
Playing the field every night
Baby get it straight
You got to roll me
Call me the tumbling dice

You got to roll me
Babe you got to roll me
Babe you got to roll me
Oh oh oh you got to roll me
Woo hoo hoo you got to roll me
Woah babe you got to roll me
Baby babe you got to roll me"
Linda Ronstadt,Desperado,"Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
You been out ridin' fences for so long now
Oh, you're a hard one
But I know that you've got your reasons
These things that are pleasin' you
Can hurt you somehow

Don't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy
She'll beat you if she's able
Know the queen of hearts is always your best bet
Well, it seems to me, some fine things
Have been laid upon your table
But you only want the things that you can't get

Desperado, you know you ain't gettin' no younger
Your pain and your hunger, drivin' you home
And freedom, oh freedom
Well, that's just some people talkin'
Your prison is walking
Through this world all alone

And don't your feet get cold in the winter time?
The sky won't snow, and the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the night-time from the day
You're losin' all your highs and lows
Ain't it funny how the feelin' goes away?

Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
Come down from your fences, open the gate
It may be rainin', but there's a rainbow above you
You better let somebody love you (let somebody love you)
Let somebody love you, before it's too late"
Linda Ronstadt,Goodbye My Friend,"Written by Karla Bonoff
© 1988 Seagrape Music (BMI)

Oh we never know where life will take us
I know it's just a ride on the wheel
And we never know when death will shake us
And we wonder how it will feel

So goodbye my friend
I know I'll never see you again
But the time together through all the years
Will take away these tears
It's okay now
Goodbye my friend

I've seen a lot things that make me crazy
And I guess I held on to you
We could've run away and left well maybe
But it wasn't time and we both knew

So goodbye my friend
I know I'll never see you again
But the love you gave me through all the years
Will take away these tears
I'm okay now
Goodbye my friend

Life's so fragile and love's so pure
We can't hold on but we try
We watch how quickly it disappears
And we never know why

But I'm okay now
Goodbye my friend
You can go now
Goodbye my friend"
Linda Ronstadt,When Will I Be Loved,"[Verse 1]
I've been cheated
Been mistreated
When will I be loved?
I've been put down
I've been pushed 'round
When will I be loved?

[Refrain]
When I find a new man
That I want for mine
He always breaks my heart in two
It happens every time

I've been made blue
I've been lied to
When will I be loved?

When I find a new man
That I want for mine

Oh, I've been cheated
Been mistreated

They say that love's a gentle thing
But it's only brought me pain
For the only man I ever loved
Has gone on the mornin' train

[Chorus]
I never will marry
I'll be no man's wife
I expect to live single
All the days of my life

[Verse 2]
Well, the train pulled out, the whistle blew
With a long and a lonesome moan
He's gone, he's gone like the mornin' dew
And left me all alone

[Chorus]
I never will marry
I'll be no man's wife
I expect to live single
All the days of my life

[Verse 3]
Well, there's many a change in the winter wind
And a change in the cloud's design
There's many a change in a young man's heart
But never a change in mine

[Chorus]
I never will marry
I'll be no man's wife
I expect to live single
All the days of my life"
Linda Ronstadt,Silver Threads and Golden Needles,"[Verse]
I don't want your lonely mansions
With a tear in every room
All I want's the love you promised
Beneath the haloed moon
But you think I should be happy
With your money and your name
And hide myself in sorrows
While you play your cheatin' game

[Chorus]
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine
And I dare not drown my sorrows
In the warm glow of your wine
You can't buy my love with money
'Cause I never was that kind
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine

[Chorus]
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine
And I dare not drown my sorrows
In the warm glow of your wine
You can't buy my love with money
'Cause I never was that kind
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine"
Linda Ronstadt,Heart Like a Wheel,"[Verse 1]
Some say the heart is just like a wheel
When you bend it, you can't mend it
But my love for you is like a sinking ship
And my heart is on that ship out in mid-ocean

[Verse 2]
When harm is done, no love can be won
I know it happens frequently
What I can't understand, oh please, God, hold my hand
Why it had to happen to me

[Bridge]
And it's only love
And it's only love
That can wreck a human being and turn him inside-out

[Verse 3]
Some say the heart is just like a wheel
When you bend it, you can't mend it
But my love for you is like a sinking ship
And my heart is on that ship out in mid-ocean"
Linda Ronstadt,The Sweetest Gift,"[Verse 1]
One day a mother went to a prison
To see an erring, but precious son
She told the warden how much she loved him
It did not matter what he had done

[Chorus]
She did not bring to him a parole or pardon plea
She brought no silver (Brought no gold), no pomp or style (None to see)
It was a halo bright, sent down from heaven's light
The sweetest gift, a mother's smile

[Verse 2]
She left a smile you can remember
She's gone to heaven from heartaches free
Those walls around you could never change her
You were her baby and e'er will be

[Chorus]
She did not bring to him a parole or pardon plea
She brought no silver (Brought no gold), no pomp or style (None to see)
It was a halo bright, sent down from heaven's light
The sweetest gift, a mother's smile

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
She did not bring to him a parole or pardon plea
She brought no silver (Brought no gold), no pomp or style (None to see)
It was a halo bright, sent down from heaven's light
The sweetest gift, a mother's smile
The sweetest gift, a mother's smile"
Linda Ronstadt,Los laureles (The Laurels),"!Ay, que laureles tan verdes!
!Que rosas tan encendidas!
Si piensas abandonarme mejor quitame la vida;
Alza los ojos a verme
Si no estas comprometido

Eres mata de algodon
Que vives en el capullo;
Ay, que tristeza me da
Cuando te llenas de orgullo
De ver a mi corazon
Enredado con el tuyo!

Eres rosa de castilla
Que solo en mayo se ve
Quisiera hacerte un invite
Pero la verda no se
Si tiene quien te lo evite
Mejor me separare

Por ""ai"" va la despedida
Chinito por tus quereres
La perdicion de los hombres
Son las benditas mujeres;

Y aqui se acaban cantando
Los versos de los laureles"
Linda Ronstadt,It’s So Easy,"It's so easy to fall in love

Oh, it seems so easy

Linda Ronstadt,It Doesn’t Matter Anymore,"[Verse 1]
There you go, baby, here am I
Well, you left me here so I could sit and cry
Golly gee, what have you done to me?
Well, I guess it doesn't matter anymore

[Verse 2]
Do you remember, baby, last September
How you held me tight each and every night?
Oh, baby, how you drove me crazy
But I guess it doesn't matter anymore

[Chorus]
There's no use in me a-crying
I've done everything now, I'm sick of trying
I've thrown away my nights
Wasted all my days, over you

[Post-Chorus]
Now you go your way, baby, and I'll go mine
Now and forever, 'til the end of time
I'll find somebody new, and baby, we'll say we're through
And you won't matter anymore

In love
With you
Oh oh

I found out
How good it feels
To have
Your love
Oh oh

Say you will
Will be mine
Forever
And always
Oh oh

Just one look
And I knew
That you
Were my only one

Someday

Linda Ronstadt,Love Is a Rose,"Love is a rose, but you'd better not pick it
Only grows when it's on the vine
Handful of thorns and you know you've missed it
Lose your love when you say the word mine

I wanna see what's never been seen
I wanna live that age old dream
C'mon boy, let's go together
Let's take the best, right now
Take the best right now

Love is a rose, but you'd better not pick it
Only grows when it's on the vine
Handful of thorns and you know you've missed it
Lose your love when you say the word mine

I wanna go to an old hoe-down
Long ago in the western town
Pick me up cause my feet are draggin
Gimme a lift and I'll paint your wagon

Love is a rose, but you'd better not pick it
Only grows when it's on the vine
Handful of thorns and you know you've missed it
Lose your love when you say the word mine

Love is a rose, but you'd better not pick it
Only grows when it's on the vine
Handful of thorns and you know you've missed it
Lose your love when you say the word mine

Linda Ronstadt,I Can’t Let Go,"Written by Chip Taylor and Al Gorgon
© 1965 Blackwood Music Inc (BMI)

Oh, I tried and I tried
But I can't say good-bye

Feel so bad, baby
Oh, it hurts me
When I think of how
You love and desert me
I'm the broken-hearted
Toy you play with

You got me going
I need you, baby
I can't let go
And I want you, baby
I gotta have all your love
I can't let go

Though I'm just one
Of your lovers
And I know there are
So many others
You do something
Strange to me, baby

You got me going
I need you, baby
I can't let go
And I want you, baby
I gotta have all your love
I can't let go

Oh, I tried and I tried
But I can't say good-bye
I know that it's wrong
And I should be so strong
But the thought of you gone
Makes me want to hold on

You got me going
I need you, baby
I can't let go
And I want you, baby
I gotta have all your love
I can't let go

You got me going
I need you, baby
I can't let go
And I want you, baby
I gotta have all your love
I can't let go

I can't let go
I can't let go
I can't let go
I can't let go
I can't let go"
Linda Ronstadt,"Poor, Poor Pitiful Me","Well I lay my head on the railroad track
Waiting on the Double E
But the train don't run by here no more
Poor poor pitiful me

Poor poor pitiful me
Poor poor pitiful me
Oh these boys won't let me be
Lord have mercy on me
Woe woe is me

Well I met a man out in Hollywood
Now I ain't naming names
Well he really worked me over good
Just like Jesse James
Yes he really worked me over good
He was a credit to his gender
Put me through some changes Lord
Sort of like a Waring blender

Poor poor pitiful me
Poor poor pitiful me
Oh these boys won't let me be
Lord have mercy on me
Woe woe is me

Well I met a boy in the Vieux Carres
Down in Yokohama
He picked me up and he threw me down
He said ""Please don't hurt me Mama""

Poor poor pitiful me
Poor poor pitiful me
Oh these boys won't let me be
Lord have mercy on me
Woe woe is me

Poor poor poor me
Poor poor pitiful me
Poor poor poor me
Poor poor pitiful me
Poor poor poor me
Poor poor pitiful me"
Linda Ronstadt,Faithless Love,"[Verse 1]
Faithless love like a river flows
Raindrops falling on a broken rose
Down in some valley where nobody goes
And the night blows in like the cold dark wind
Faithless love like a river flows

[Verse 2]
Faithless love, where did I go wrong?
Was it telling stories in a heartbreak song
Where nobody's right and nobody was wrong?
Faithless love will find you and the misery entwine you
Faithless love, where did I go wrong?

[Bridge]
Well, I guess I'm standing in the hall of broken dreams
That's the way it sometimes goes
Whenever a new love never turns out like it seems
I guess the feeling comes and goes

[Verse 3]
Faithless love like a river flows
Like raindrops falling on a broken rose
Down in some valley where nobody goes
Faithless love has found me, thrown its chilly arms around me
Faithless love like a river flows"
Linda Ronstadt,Hurt So Bad,"Written by Teddy Randazzo, Bobby Wilding, Bobby Hart
© 1965 Vogue Music (BMI)

I know you
Don't know what I'm going through
Standing here looking at you

Well let me tell you that it hurts so bad
It makes me feel so sad
It makes me hurt so bad to see you again

Like needles and pins
People say ""you've been making out okay
He's in love don't stand in his way""

Well let me tell you that it hurts so bad
It makes me feel so sad
It's gonna hurt so bad if you walk away
Why don't you stay and let me make it up to you
I'll do anything you want me to
You loved me before please love me again
I can't let you go back to her
Please don't go
Please don't go

Please don't go
Please don't go
Hurt so bad
Come back it hurts so bad
Don't make it hurt so bad
I'm begging you please

Oooooh oh oh oh
Come back it hurts so bad
Come back it hurts so bad
I'm begging you please
Oh! No!
Noooooo!"
Linda Ronstadt,Ooh Baby Baby,"[Intro]
Ooh, la la la

[Verse 1]
I did you wrong
My heart went out to play
And in the game I lost you
What a price to pay
I'm crying

[Chorus]
Ooh, baby baby
Ooh, baby baby

[Verse 2]
Mistakes
I know I've made a few
But I'm only human
You've made mistakes, too
I'm crying

[Chorus]
Ooh, baby baby
Ooh, baby baby
Ooh, baby baby
Ooh, baby baby

[Bridge]
I'm just about at
The end of my rope
But I can't stop trying
I can't give up hope

'Cause I'll be here
Someday I'll hold you near
Whisper I still love you
Until that day is here
Ooh, I'm crying

Ooh, baby baby
Ooh, baby baby
Ooh, baby baby
Ooh, baby baby

Ooh-ooh-ooh-hoo"
Linda Ronstadt,Tracks of My Tears,"People say I'm the life of the party
'Cause I tell a joke or two
Although I might be laughing loud and hearty
Deep inside I'm blue

So take a good look at my face
You know my smile looks out of place
If you look closer it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears

Oh I need you, need you

Since you left me if you see me with another guy
Looking like I'm having fun
Although he might be cute he's just a substitute
Because you're the permanent one

So take a good look at my face
You know my smile looks out of place
If you look closer it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears

Outside I'm masquerading
Inside my hope is fading
I'm just a clown since you put me down
My smile is my make-up I wear since my break-up with you

Baby take a good look at my face
You know my smile looks out of place
If you look closer it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears

Woah baby take a good look at my face
You know my smile looks out of place
If you look closer it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears

Ooh ooh ooh ooh"
Linda Ronstadt,Por un amor (For a Love),"Por un amor
Me desvelo y vivo apasionada;
Tengo on amor
Que en mi vida dejo para siempre amargo dolor

Pobre de mi
Esta vida mejor que se acabe
No es para mi...

Pobre de mi (ay corazon)
Pobre de mi (no sufras mas)
Cuanto sufre mi pecho
Que late tan solo por ti

Por un amor
He llorado gotitas de sangre del corazon
Me has dejado con el alma herida
Sin compasion"
Linda Ronstadt,I Can’t Help It (If I’m Still in Love With You),"[Verse]
Today I passed you on the street and my heart fell at your feet
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
Somebody else stood by your side and she looked so satisfied
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

[Chorus 1]
A picture from the past came slowly stealing
As I brushed your arm and stood so close to you
Suddenly I got that old time feeling
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

[Chorus 2]
It's hard to know another's lips have kissed you
And held you just the way I used to do
Heaven only knows how much I've missed you
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

[Refrain]
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you"
Eric Church,Springsteen,"[Verse 1]
To this day when I hear that song
I see you standin' there on that lawn
Discount shades, store bought tan
Flip flops and cut-off jeans
Somewhere between that setting sun
I'm on Fire and Born to Run
You looked at me and I was done
And we're, we're just getting started

[Verse 2]
I was singin' to you, you were singin' to me
I was so alive, never been more free
Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang
Oohh
Stayed there 'til they forced us out
And took the long way to your house
I can still hear the sound of you sayin' ""don't go""

[Chorus]
When I think about you, I think about 17
I think about my old Jeep
I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like the soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen

[Verse 3]
I bumped into you by happenstance
You probably wouldn't even know who I am
But if I whispered your name I bet there'd still be a spark
Back when I was gasoline
And this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didn't care what your mom would think
About your name on my arm

[Verse 4]
Baby, is it spring or is it summer?
The guitar sound or the beat of that drummer
You hear sometimes late at night
On your radio
Even though you're a million miles away
When you hear Born in the USA
You relive those glory days
So long ago

[Chorus]
When you think about me, do you think about 17
Do you think about my old Jeep
Think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen

Eric Church,Mr. Misunderstood,"[Verse 1]
Hey there, weird kid in your high-top shoes
Sitting in the back of the class; I was just like you
Always left out, never fit in
Owning that path you're walking in
Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood

[Verse 2]
Now, your buddies get their rocks off on Top 40 radio
But you love your daddy's vinyl, old-time rock and roll
Elvis Costello, Ray Wylie Hubbard
And think Jeff Tweedy is one bad mother
Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood

[Chorus]
One day you'll lead the charge, you'll lead the band
Guitar Hero with lightnin' hands
And the girls will like your tattoos and the veins in your arms
They'll be helpless to your musical charms
And they'll all hold up their hands
They'll all wanna dance
Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood

[Verse 3]
First time I met Alabama Hannah, I was skinny as a rail
Red hair tied up in a blue bandanna
She was hotter than the Devil's hell
She turned me on to Back Porch Pickers
Jackson Pollock, and gin
Her daddy didn't trust my intentions
So he turned to his daddy's old .410
I'm Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood

[Chorus]
Had an axe to grind, so off I went
Mad at the sun for coming up again
I lost religion, found my soul in the blues
Rubbed the velvet off my blue suede shoes
Yeah, everybody held up their hands
And every soul on Beale Street danced
With Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood

[Verse 4]
So I went with it like a colt on my Plymouth
Through the glass behind my rear-view
Took a left when the world went right down 16th Avenue
Played with fire and I played on ledges
Every circus, stage, and county fair
They tried to file my points, sand my edges
And I just grew out my hair
I'm Mr. Misunderstood, I'm Mr. Misunderstood

[Chorus]
They're standing in line, chasing the buzz
Til the next big things and already was
And hell if they know what they're trying to find
If it ain't that same old, been-done kind
Yeah, gives the head-scratchers fits
Wondering how in the hell they missed
I'm Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood

[Verse 5]
Hey there, weird kid in your high-top shoes
Sitting in the back of the class; I was just like you
Mr. Misunderstood (I understand)
Mr. Misunderstood (I understand)
Mr. Misunderstood (I understand)
Mr. Misunderstood (I understand)
Mr. Misunderstood (I understand)
I'm Mr. Misunderstood (let's go out of here)

Eric Church,Record Year,"[Verse 1]
Since you turned the tables on me
I've been steady and learnin' lonely
Keepin' this turntable spinnin'
Everything from Jones to Jennings
Slowly plannin' my survival
In a three-foot stack of vinyl
Since you had to walk on outta here
I've been havin' a record year

[Verse 2]
I bet you thought before you left
I'd just sit in silence by myself
Turn this house into a jail
Dyin' slow in a livin' hell
But love's got a funny way of keepin' score
And your leavin' lit up my scoreboard
I usually make it through side A sober
All bets are off when I flip her over
One bourbon, one scotch, one beer
I'm havin' a record year

[Chorus]
Quarter notes and Hank's half time
Are poundin' on this heart of mine
Song to song, I pass my time
With these speakers on ten
Your good-and-gone keeps me up all night
Along with Songs In The Key of Life
I'm either gonna get over you
Or I'm gonna blow out my ears
Yeah, you're out there now
Doin' God knows how, and I'm stuck here
Havin' a record year

[Verse 3]
Your leavin' left me goin' crazy
I'm countin' on a needle to save me
I drop it in the groove
And we go 'round and 'round
And down in a spiral
I guess I really oughta call and thank you
I rediscovered  Red Headed Stranger
Got down with old James Brown
And found New Grass Revival
If you find your way back, I owe you a beer
For my record year

[Chorus]
Quarter notes and Hank's half time
Are poundin' on this heart of mine
Song to song, I pass my time
With these speakers on ten
Your good-and-gone keeps me up all night
Along with Songs In The Key Of Life
I'm either gonna get over you
Or I'm gonna blow out my ears
Yeah, you're out there now
Doin' God knows how, but I'm stuck here

Eric Church,Stick That in Your Country Song,"[Verse 1]
Take me on up to Detroit City
Jails are full, the factories empty
Mama's crying, young boys dying
Under that red, white, and blue still flying
Drop me off in Baltimore
Where every other window's got a plywood board
Where dreams become drugs and guns
The only way out is to shoot or run

Stick that in your country song, yeah
Take that one to number one, yeah
And get the whole world singing along, yeah
Stick that in your country song, yeah (Oh)

Baby girl he'll never see again

Stick that in your country song, yeah
Take that one to number one, yeah
And get the whole world singing along, man
Stick that in your country song, yeah (Oh)

I light the arrow, pull the bow
Shoot that fire right through my soul
Hit my pride, fist up high
I wanna feel the rush, I wanna feel alive
Oh, come on I want to pound the dash
Stomp the gas, drive too fast
Rock me hard, stop my heart
And blow the speakers right out of this car

Stick that in your country song, yeah
And take that one to number one, yeah (Number one, yeah)

Gimme one about the teacher who
Tryna change a life or two
She'll be rocking out all night with you
Tomorrow, she'll be back in a red-brick school
Where kids are climbing off the walls
And it's scary walking down the hall
She's underpaid, she's overworked
Come on, man, shout one out to her

Stick that in your country song, come on
Take that one to number one, yeah
And get the whole world singing along

Eric Church,Like A Wrecking Ball,"[Verse 1]
I, I been gone
Been gone too long, singing my songs on the road
Another town, one more show and I'm coming home
Don't give a damn what these keys are for
I'm gonna knock down that front door, and

[Chorus]
I'ma find out what that house is made of
Been too many nights since it's felt us make love
I wanna rock some sheetrock, knock some pictures off the wall
Love you baby, like a wrecking ball

[Verse 2]
You, look at you
Send me one more shot sitting on a bathroom sink
Damn you really turn me on painting your toenails pink
Easy baby before you say
""But if I can make it just one more day,"" and

[Chorus]
That old house is gonna be shaking
I hope those bricks and boards can take it
But I won't be surprised if the whole damn place just falls
I'm gonna rock you baby, like a wrecking ball

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
That old house is gonna be shaking
Rafter rocking, foundation quaking
Crash right through the front door, back you up against the wall
Love you baby
Take it right there baby
Rock you baby, like a wrecking ball"
Eric Church,Some of It,"[Verse 1]
Beer don't keep, love's not cheap
And trucks don't wreck themselves
Mama ain't a shrink, daddy ain't a bank
And God ain't a wishin' well
Money ain't rich, everybody sins
And nobody wins in a fight
And sometimes wrong is right

[Chorus]
Some of it you learn the hard way
Some of it you read on a page
Some of it comes from heartbreak
Most of it comes with age
And none of it ever comes easy
A bunch of it you maybe can't use
I know I don't probably know what I think I do
But there's somethin' to some of it

[Verse 2]
Girls like to laugh, tears don't last
And scared's what praying's for
If it's close, swing the bat, everybody's got a past
And love's worth livin' for
When you dance, hold her close, 'til it breaks, go for broke
Be the first to reach for her hand
No, you don't get to do some things again

[Chorus]
Some of it you learn the hard way
Some of it you read on a page
Some of it comes from heartbreak
Most of it comes with age
And none of it ever comes easy
A bunch of it you maybe can't use
I know I don't probably know what I think I do
But there's somethin' to some of it

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
When you can take it slow, 'cause time sure won't
What really makes you a man
Is bein' true to her
'Til your glass runs out of sand

[Chorus]
Some of it you learn the hard way
Some of it you read on a page
Some of it comes from heartbreak
Most of it comes with age
And none of it ever comes easy
A bunch of it you maybe can't use
I know I don't probably know what I think I do
But there's somethin' to some of it
Some of it"
Eric Church,Round Here Buzz,"[Verse 1]
Another Friday night there's a line of cars leavin'
Home team's got an out-of-towner
Me, I'm sittin' on the hood of mine drinkin'
I'm just a parkin' lot down-and-outer

[Verse 2]
Under that high school bleacher
I drove that preacher's daughter crazy
Her mama was my homeroom teacher
And her dad was hell bent on savin' me

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I'm sure there's higher highs
Where the high risers rise
But me, I'm gonna sit right here tonight, and

[Chorus]
Catch me a 'round here buzz
'Cause you ain't 'round here none
Keep puttin' 'em down here, 'nother round here
'Til my down goes up
Lit up like that one stoplight
Across from that welcome sign
Ever since you caught that out there bug
I catch me a 'round here buzz

[Verse 3]
I never had big-city eyes
Hell, I've never been east of Dallas
Got no idea where you are now
Or if you ever got that penthouse palace

[Pre-Chorus]
No, Scotty's ain't got no vibe
Got no gas in his neon light
But he's got two-for-one 'til 2:00 tonight

[Chorus]
Catch me a 'round here buzz
'Cause you ain't 'round here none
To puttin' 'em down here, 'nother round here
'Til my down goes up
Lit up like that one stoplight
Across from that welcome sign
Ever since you caught that out there bug
I catch me a 'round here buzz

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Catch me a 'round here buzz
'Cause you ain't 'round here none
Keep puttin' 'em down here, 'nother round here
'Til my down here
Is lit up like that one stoplight
Across from that welcome sign
Ever since you caught that out there bug
I catch me a 'round here buzz

[Outro]
I catch me a 'round here buzz
'Round here buzz
I catch me a 'round here buzz"
Eric Church,Mixed Drinks About Feelings,"[Verse 1: Eric Church]
Turn on a neon light
At least make it feel like night
Put on some this or that
Maybe I won't feel so bad
I need a little background noise
To drown out this little voice
Runnin' circles 'round my brain
Screamin' louder than the pain

[Chorus: Both]
My head is spinning
My resolve is reeling
I can tell by the heavy in my heart
I'm goin' down soon
No use fightin' the fight
It's no contest tonight
My figured out has never been more confused
Havin' mixed drinks about feelings and you

[Verse 2: Susan Tedeschi]
Turn off the bedroom light
Put on a brave face and face the night
It's either get used to this dread
Or the cold spot in our bed
The bottle helps, but the memory burns
The whiskey soothes, but I toss and turn
I'll find sleep 'til dreams relent
Wake up tired and try again

[Chorus: Both]
My head is spinning
My resolve is reeling
I can tell by the heavy in my heart
I'm goin' down soon
No use fightin' the fight
It's no contest tonight
My figured out has never been more confused
Havin' mixed drinks about feelings and you
Havin' mixed drinks about feelings and you

[Outro]
Turn on a neon light
At least make it feel like night"
Eric Church,Talladega,"It was the summer before the real world started and
The deal was we would get to go, if we
Cleaned it up, and got it running
Daddy’s old Winnebago
Wing and a prayer down 65
Five best friends on four bald tires
I can still see Billy smiling
When we finally made it
To Talladega
Boys raised up
Whiskey in your glass
Here’s to turning up
Slowing down
And cars that go real fast
We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing
And thinking as that checkered flag was waving
Sure would like to stay in
Talladega
Like a storm, time rolls on
You can’t hit pause, that's just the deal
Most days in life don’t stand out
But life’s about those days that we all like

Rocking Randall
Getting rowdy
Shooting roman candles at the man in the moon
‘til the Alabama sun was breaking
Over Talladega
Boys raised up
Whiskey in your glass
Here’s to turning up
Slowing down
And cars that go real fast
We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing
And thinking as that checked flag was waving
Sure would like to stay in
Talladega
When the winds go cold
And it blows October
I think about us shoulder to shoulder
Like those cars my thoughts roll over and over and over
In my mind
Tonight I’m in Talladega
Boys raised up
Whiskey in your glass
Here’s to turning up
Slowing down
And cars that go real fast

We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing
And thinking as that checked flag was waving
Sure would like to stay in
Talladega

Talladega
Talladega"
Eric Church,Higher Wire,"[Verse 1]
I don't why it does but it sure do, don't it, honey?
Bein' in love with you is as easy as spendin' money
Keep me higher than the fog, it's a-hidin' my copper line-ups
Yeah, there ain't no landing gear on this big jetliner

[Chorus]
Benedictine baby
Chartreuse snake old lady
Appalachia moonshine crazy
Bible belt and a sinner's fire
Love on a higher wire

[Verse 2]
Brother, it's a mother undercover with a voodoo woman
Roll the dice, bet your life every night, keep the black magic comin'
I should run from you like a vampire does from daylight
But I don't know how to quit 'cause I know what addiction tastes like

[Chorus]
Benedictine baby
Chartreuse snake old lady
Appalachia moonshine crazy
Bible belt and a sinner's fire
Love on a higher wire

[Bridge]
I rode on twenty
Bet on black
Roll them bones
Drink my Jack
Go all in
Call my bluff
And don't nothin' keep me comin' back again

[Chorus]
Benedictine baby
Chartreuse snake old lady
Appalachia moonshine crazy
Bible belt and a sinner's fire
Lo-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
On a higher wire"
Eric Church,Three Year Old,"[Verse 1]
Use every crayon color that you've got
A fishing pole sinks faster than a tackle box
Nothing turns a day around like licking a mixing bowl
I learned that from a three year old

[Verse 2]
A garbage can is a damn good spot to hide truck keys
Why go inside when you can go behind a tree?
Walking barefoot through the mud
Will knock the rust right off your soul
I learned that from a three year old

[Chorus]
You can be a cowboy on the moon
Dig to China with a spoon
Talk to Jesus on the phone
Say ""I love you"" all day long
And when you're wrong, you should just say so
I learned that from a three year old

[Verse 3]
""Mama is an angel,"" I heard him tell the man upstairs
He went on and on and back and forth
Like God was laying there
Tonight, I sleep me down to lay and pray to keep my soul
Yeah, I learned that from a three year old

[Chorus]
You can be a cowboy on the moon
Dig to China with a spoon
Talk to Jesus on the phone
Say ""I love you"" all day long
And when you're wrong, you should just say so
I learned that from a three year old

[Outro]
Sometimes, all you need is a hand to hold
Couple arms to kill the cold
And when your wrong, you should just say so
I learned that from a three year old
Yeah, honey, I learned that from our three year old"
Eric Church,Monsters,"[Verse 1]
I killed my first monster when I was seven years old
He melted like butter in my bathroom's sixty-watt bulb
Kept a three-cell MagLite from Daddy's workshop drawer
Under my pillow and I'd pull it like a sword

[Chorus]
Anymore when a restless feelin' keeps me up at night
Fallin' on my knees is my new turnin' on the light
I keep my faith intact, make sure my prayers are said
'Cause I've learned that the monsters ain't the ones beneath the bed

[Verse 2]
The wolf hunts a hungry man and the devil a lonely heart
A minefield of bad decisions lay hidin' in the dark
Greed stalks, sickness steals, and pride lays a wicked trap
You can't avoid 'em all, no, you gotta trust me on that

[Chorus]
Anymore when a restless feelin' keeps me up at night
Fallin' on my knees is my new turnin' on the light
I keep my faith intact, and make sure my prayers are said
'Cause I've learned that the monsters ain't the ones beneath the bed

[Verse 3]
Daddy, check my closet, leave on the bathroom light
I smile and say, ""All clear"" when I tuck him in for the night
But Daddy, I'm still scared, can I sleep with you instead?
I kneel down beside my little man and I bow my head

[Chorus]
Anymore when a restless feelin' keeps me up at night
Fallin' on my knees is my new turnin' on the light
I keep my faith intact, make sure my prayers are said
'Cause I've learned that the monsters ain't the ones beneath the bed
And I've learned that the monsters ain't underneath the bed"
Eric Church,Holdin’ My Own,"[Verse 1]
Always been a fighter, scrapper, and a clawer
Used up some luck in lawyers
Like Huck from Tom Sawyer jumped on my raft
And shoved off chasing my dreams
Reeling in big fishes
I had some hits, and a few big misses
I gave 'em hell and got a few stitches
And these days, I show off my scars

[Chorus]
With one arm around my baby
And one arm around my boys
A heart that's still pretty crazy
And a head that hates the noise
If the world comes knocking
Tell 'em I'm not home
I'm finally holdin' my own

[Verse 2]
I've burned up the fast lane
Dodging drugs and divorce
If I'm proof of anything
God sure loves Troubadours
Sometimes, late at night
I miss the smoke and neon
Sneak out of bed, grab a six-string
Play what's still turnin' me on
Like that tight old-time rock and roll
Or that right-down-home country gold
I miss blues and soul
But not more than I miss being home

[Chorus]
With one arm around my baby
And one arm around my boys
A heart that's still pretty crazy
And a head that got sick of noise
If the world comes knocking, wondering where I've gone
Tell 'em I'm not home
I'm finally holdin' my own

[Bridge]
'Til I run out of time
I'm gonna spend the rest of mine

[Chorus]
With one arm around my baby
And one arm around my boys
A heart that's still pretty crazy
And a head that just got sick of noise
If the world comes knocking
Tell 'em I'm not home
I'm finally holdin' my own

[Outro]
And when my time on Earth is done
I want they write it on my stone
I lived, loved, and died holdin' my own
I lived, loved, and died holdin' my own"
Eric Church,Kill A Word,"[Verse 1]
If I could kill a word and watch it die
I'd poison ""never,"" shoot ""goodbye""
Beat ""regret"" when I felt I had the nerve
Yeah, I'd pound ""fear"" to a pile of sand
Choke ""lonely"" out with my bare hands
I'd hang ""hate"" so that it can't be heard
If I could only kill a word

[Verse 2]
I'd take ""brokeness"" out back
And break ""heartbreak,"" stand there and laugh
Right in its face while shootin' it the bird
I'd put ""upset"" down in its place
I'd squeeze the life out of ""disgrace""
Lay ""over"" under six cold feet of dirt
If I could only kill a word

[Chorus]
Give me sticks, give me stones
Bend my body, break my bones
Use staff and rod to turn me black and blue
Cause you can't unhear, you can't unsay
But if it were up to me to change
I'd turn ""lies"" and ""hate"" to ""love"" and ""truth""
If I could only kill a word

[Verse 3]
I'd knock out ""temptation""'s teeth
I'd sever ""evil,"" let it bleed
Then light up ""wicked,"" stand and watch it burn
I'd take ""vice"" and I'd take ""vile""
Tie 'em up there with ""hostile""
Hang 'em high and leave 'em for the birds
If I could only kill a word

[Chorus]
So give me sticks, give me stones
Bend my body, break my bones
Use staff and rod to turn me black and blue
Cause you can't unhear, you can't unsay
But if it were up to me to change
I'd turn ""lies"" and ""hate"" to ""love"" and ""truth""
If I could only kill a word
If I could only kill a word"
Eric Church,Knives Of New Orleans,"[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'd give this last wrinkled dollar
In my pocket that I earned
With a hammer and vice
If I could undo some things
And grow me some wings
Fly out of this quarter tonight

[Verse 2]
Yeah, tonight, every man with a TV
Is seeing a man with my clothes and my face
In the last thirty minutes
I've gone from a person of interest
To a full-blown manhunt underway

[Pre-Chorus]
I did what I did
I have no regrets
When you cross the line
You get what you get

[Chorus]
Tonight, a bleeding memory
Is tomorrow's guilty vein
Your auburn hair on a faraway sea wall
Screams across the Pontchartrain
I'm haunted by headlights
And a crescent city breeze
One wrong turn on Bourbon
Cuts like the knives of New Orleans

[Verse 3]
I'm a ghost dodging bullets
In all of these alleys
Just looking for my getaway keys
Wrapped up in the night
Hiding out in plain sight
But this grip's getting tight around me

[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't no getting out
That I can see
They'll take me dead
If they ever take me

[Chorus]
Tonight, a bleeding memory
Is tomorrow's guilty vein
Your auburn hair on a faraway sea wall
Screams across the Pontchartrain
I'm haunted by headlights
And a crescent city breeze
One wrong turn on Bourbon
Cuts like the knives of New Orleans
Of New Orleans

[Bridge]
What I wouldn't do
For just one more kiss
I'm all out of time
Honey, it's come down to this

[Chorus]
I'm haunted by your hazel eyes
And this crescent city breeze
One wrong turn on Bourbon
Cuts like the knives of New Orleans

[Outro]
I did what I did
I did what I did
I did what I did
I did what I did"
Eric Church,Heart Like a Wheel,"[Verse 1]
She's caviar and mascara
I'm corduroy and leather
It'd take one hell of an imagination
To ever paint us together

[Verse 2]
Places I like to haunt at
She wouldn't be caught dead
Don't make sense to the neighbors, don't look good on paper
And sure don't make sense in my head

[Chorus]
But I got a heart like a wheel, baby, let's go
Get in this heart like a wheel and baby, we'll roll

[Verse 3]
Can't say there won't be rough patches
Scratches from thorns and briars
Over or under, we'll roll like thunder
As long as there's tread on these tires

[Chorus]
I got a heart like a wheel, baby, let's go
Get in this heart like a wheel and baby, let's roll

[Bridge]
Ain't no map, ain't no way
Ain't no lights on this long highway
But I know the way by heart
Bring on the dark
Honey, don't worry

[Chorus]
Baby, I got a heart like a wheel, baby, let's go
Get in this heart like a wheel and baby, let's roll
I got a heart like a wheel, baby, let's go
Get in this heart like a wheel and baby, we roll
Get in this heart like a wheel and baby, let's go"

Boo, boo, boo-boo-boo-boo-boo
Boo, boo, boo-boo-boo-boo-boo

[Verse 1]
I've seen the Joshua Tree
Got down on my knees
Threw the Virgin Mother a prayer
I've walked glass barefooted
Strolled 'cross the devil's hot coals
I've tried everything, I swear

[Chorus]
Oh, but hey (hey) what can I say?
I'm a desperate man

Eric Church,Carolina,"[Verse 1]
There's a cabin in a valley
My grandpa built on your land
Your mountains are a canvas
For the makers hand
Tonight I'm fishing Elk River
If only in my mind
No, I haven't seen her banks in such a long, long time
I carry you in my heart
Your memory comes over me like the dark and

[Chorus]
Like a phone call from my baby
Saying' honey I miss ya like crazy
Like the sound of a siren song
Oh Carolina, ya keep calling me home
Calling' me home

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I grow weary
From going' all the time
I love to take a minute
Let you ease my mind
I'd love to see my mama
Maybe go for a drive
But I got to play the star in some little town again tonight
Don't get me wrong
I love what I do
It's just another song about missing you

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Calling me home[x3]
Oh, oh, we're almost home

[Chorus]
Like a phone call from my baby
Saying honey I miss ya, I miss ya like crazy
Just like the song of a siren song

Oh Carolina
Carolina[x2]
Keep calling me home
Calling me home[x3]
Carolina[x2]
Keep calling me home"
Eric Church,The Snake,"[Verse 1]
Rattlesnake said to the copperhead
""You give us vipers a real bad name""
You prey on the weakest, fight for no reason
No wonder we get blamed""
Copperhead laughed, said, ""Kiss my ass!
You can bark but there ain't much bite
You rattle that tail, but it's fear I smell
I think you're shaking out of fright""

[Chorus]
Rattlesnake, copperhead
Either one of them'll kill you dead
We stay hungry, they get fed
And don't pass the plate around
Lie by lie, cheat by cheat
Venom in smiling teeth
They just run those forked tongues
And the whole world's burning down

[Post-Chorus]
Wow! Wow! Wow!

[Verse 2]
Copperhead said to the rattlesnake
""If you ever wanna make it rain
We could team up, be twice as tough
Fear will be our game""
Rattlesnake said to the copperhead
""Y'know we were the original sin
And I bet you my rattle against your copper
That the bitch takes the apple again""

[Chorus]
Rattlesnake, copperhead
Either one of them'll kill you dead
We stay hungry, they get fed
And don't pass the plate around
Lie by lie, cheat by cheat
Venom in smiling teeth
They just run those forked tongues
And the whole world's burning down

[Post-Chorus]
Wow! Wow! Wow!

[Outro]
Rattlesnake said to the copperhead
""Ain't no way they'd win
'Cause the mice are sheep and the shepherd's asleep""
And the copperhead said, ""Amen"""
Eric Church,Hell of a View,"[Verse 1]
I was no daddy's dream, was not your mama's prayer
But I was your first and your last ticket out of there
I caught your wings on fire when I smoked my Bronco tires
Out of that town

[Verse 2]
I'm good at rollin' dice, no good at standin' still
You liked the thought of chasin' life instead of dollar bills
We were livin' reckless, nothin' to catch us, baby
But the ground

[Chorus]
This ain't for everybody, toes hangin' off the ledge
Like we got nothin' to lose
Ain't always heaven, baby, this livin' on the edge
You holdin' me, holdin' you, it's a hell of a view

[Verse 3]
I paint with my old Gibson, you paint your purple sky
This town's our canvas, baby, let's paint it red tonight
Go out like shootin' stars, chasin' what's in our hearts
Into thе blue (Into the blue)

[Chorus]
This ain't for еverybody, toes hangin' off the ledge
Like we got nothin' to lose
Ain't always heaven, baby, this livin' on the edge
You holdin' me holdin' you, it's a hell of a view

[Refrain]
A hell of a view

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
We ain't for everybody, toes hangin' off a ledge
Like we got nothin', we got nothin' to lose
Ain't always heaven, baby, this livin' on the edge

A hell of a view
A hell of a view (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

Eric Church,Like Jesus Does,"[Verse 1]
I'm a long-gone Waylon song on vinyl
I'm a back row sinner at a tent revival
But she believes in me like she believes her Bible
And loves me like Jesus does

[Verse 2]
I'm a lead foot leaning on a souped-up Chevy
I'm a good old boy, drinking whiskey and rye on the levee
But she carries me when my sins make me heavy
And loves me like Jesus does

[Chorus]
All the crazy in my dreams
Both my broken wings
Every single piece of everything I am
Yeah, she knows the man I ain't
She forgives me when I can't
The devil, man, no, he don't stand a chance
Cause she loves me like Jesus does

[Verse 3]
I always thought she'd give up on me one day
Wash her hands of me, leave me staring down some runway
But I thank God each night, and twice on Sunday
That she loves me like Jesus does

[Chorus]
All the crazy in my dreams
Both my broken wings
Every single piece of everything I am
Yeah, she knows the man I ain't
She forgives me when I can't
The devil, man, no, he don't stand a chance
Cause she loves me like Jesus does


[Outro]
Yes, she knows the man I ain't
She forgives me when I can't
That devil, man, he don't stand a chance
She loves me like Jesus does
I'm a long-gone Waylon song on vinyl"
Eric Church,Lynyrd Skynyrd Jones,"[Verse 1]
Lynyrd Skynyrd Jones, spelled with all 4 y's
Was born in 70-something, 'tween ""Sweet Home"" and ""You Got That Right""
His mama met his daddy at a Tallahassee show
But just like Tuesday, daddy wound up gone on down the road

[Chorus]
Lynyrd Skynyrd Jones hailed from Gadsden, Alabama
Born to carry on who his mama was a fan of
Don’t ask me no questions and I won’t tell you no lies
That’s what she always told him, right up 'til the day she died

[Refrain]
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Lynyrd wasn't black or white, he was somewhere in-between
Throw in abandoned and confused, and you get the blues when you’re just 13
Well, he found his salvation in a pawnshop-bought guitar
You can't teach that kind of pickin’, it’s gotta come right from your heart

[Chorus]
Lynyrd Skynyrd Jones hailed from Gadsden, Alabama
Callеd to carry on who his mama was a fan of
Don’t ask me no questions and I won’t tell you no liеs
That’s what she always told him, right up till the day she died

[Refrain]
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 3]
When Lynyrd Skynyrd Jones’ mama passed away
A dressed in all black, black man stood up in the back to say
Been thinking about your mama since that Tallahassee show
Yeah, son, I am your daddy and my name is Curtis Loew

[Refrain]
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh"
Eric Church,Darkest Hour (Helene Edit),"[Verse 1]
If you were down in a gutter
Where the homeless shudder, trying to shake off the snow
If your tide was low, you lost your rudder
I'd show you where to go
If you were stuck out on the burning sand
Hair on fire in a blinding gale
I'd throw down a rope
And pull you out of your hell

[Chrous]
In your darkest hour
Baby, I'd come running (I'd come running)
In your darkest hour
I'd light your way
Baby, don't give up (Don't give up)
I'll do everything in my power
To take even a minute of your darkest hour

[Verse 2]
Life can be a labyrinth
A maze of moments, a pyramid of plans
When all goes south, I'll bе your compass
'Til your needle spins you north again

[Chorus]
In your darkest hour
Baby, I'd come running (I'd comе running)
In your darkest hour
I'd light your way
Baby, don't give up (Don't give up)
I'll do everything in my power
To take even a minute of your darkest hour

[Bridge]
All I really know is I never know
What's coming around the bend
But you should know you're not alone
Hang on and hold my hand
Ooh

[Chorus]
In your darkest hour
Baby, I'd come running (I'd come running)
In your darkest hour
I'd light your way
Baby, don't give up (Don't give up)
I'll do everything in my power
To take even a minute of your darkest hour

[Outro]
Ooh
Baby, I'd come running (Don't give up)
Yeah, I'd light your way (Don't give up)
Ah, don't give up
Baby, I'd come running (Don't give up)
Baby, I'd come running (Don't give up)
Don't give up
Ooh (Don't give up)
Light your way, baby
Baby, I'd come running (Don't give up)
Don't give up, baby"
Eric Church,Why Not Me,"[Verse 1]
Why you with your long brown hair flowing
And you with your fresh tattooed skin
And you from the Western Virginia
That you'll never get to see again
As darkness descended the desert
And a bad actor starred in his play
Why you from Tennessee did life capture
And me from Tennessee get away

[Chorus]
And when the morning sun hit the mountain
And a glorious still calmed the breeze
I asked the God of all knowing wisdom
Why you and why not me?

[Verse 2]
Yeah the lord is my refuge and fortress
My God with whom I trust
But I'll never know why the wicked
Gets to prey on the best of us
Why you full of life and promise
At the top of your lungs so loud
My songs that you sang so sweetly will ring
In my ears forever now

[Chorus]
And when the morning sun hits the mountain
And a glorious still calms the breeze
I'll ask the God of infinite wisdom
Why you and why not me?

[Outro]
And every morning when the sun hits the mountain
And a glorious still calms the breeze
I'll ask the God of my salvation
Why you and why not me?
Why you and why not me?"
Eric Church,Give Me Back My Hometown,"[Verse 1]
Damn, I used to love this view
Sit here and drink a few
Main street and the high school lit up on Friday night
Down there it's another touchdown
Man, this year's team is stout
I can hear them going crazy
And up here so am I
Thinking about you sitting there saying I hate this, I hate it
If you couldn't stand living here why'd you take it, take it

[Chorus]
Give me back my hometown
'Cause this is my hometown

[Verse 2]
All the colors of my youth
The red, the green, the hope, the truth
Are beating me black and blue cause you're in every scene
My friends try to cheer me up, get together at the Pizza Hut
I didn't have the heart to tell them that was our place
These sleepy streetlights on every sidewalk side street
Shed a light on everything that used to be

[Chorus]
Give me back my hometown
'Cause this is my hometown
Yeah, yeah, ooohh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
You can have my grandma's locket
The knife out of my grandpa's pocket
Yeah my state champion jacket
I don't care you can have it
Every made memory
Every picture, every broken dream
Yeah everything, everything, everything

[Chorus]
Give me back my hometown
'Cause this is my hometown
Yeah, yeah, ooohh, yeah, yeah"
Hank Williams Jr,A Country Boy Can Survive,"[Verse 1]
The preacher man says it's the end of time
And the Mississippi River, she's a-goin' dry
The interest is up and the stock market's down
And you only get mugged if you go downtown

[Verse 2]
I live back in the woods, you see
My woman and the kids and the dogs and me
I got a shotgun, a rifle and a 4-wheel drive
And a country boy can survive, country folks can survive

[Verse 3]
I can plow a field all day long
I can catch catfish from dusk 'til dawn
We make our own whiskey and our own smoke too
Ain't too many things these old boys can't do
We grow good ol' tomatoes and homemade wine
And a country boy can survive, country folks can survive

[Chorus]
Because you can't starve us out and you can't make us run
'Cause we're them old boys raised on shotguns
We say grace, and we say ma'am
If you ain't into that, we don't give a damn

[Verse 4]
We came from the West Virginia coal mines
And the Rocky Mountains and the western skies
And we can skin a buck, we can run a trotline
And a country boy can survive, country folks can survive

[Verse 5]
I had a good friend in New York City
He never called me by my name, just ""Hillbilly""
My grandpa taught me how to live off the land
And his taught him to be a businessman
He used to send me pictures of the Broadway nights
And I'd send him some homemade wine
But he was killed by a man with a switchblade knife
For 43 dollars, my friend lost his life
I'd love to spit some Beech-Nut in that dude's eyes
Then shoot him with my old .45
'Cause a country boy can survive, country folks can survive

[Chorus]
'Cause you can't starve us out and you can't make us run
'Cause we're them old boys raised on shotguns
We say grace, and we say ma'am
If you ain't into that, we don't give a damn

[Verse 6]
We're from north California and south Alabam'
And little towns all around this land
And we can skin a buck, and run a trotline
And a country boy can survive, country folks can survive

[Outro]
A country boy can survive
Country folks can survive"
Hank Williams Jr,Family Tradition,"[Verse 1]
Country music singers have always been a real close family
But lately some of my kinfolks have disowned a few others and me
I guess it's because I kind of changed my direction
Lord, I guess I went and broke their family tradition
They get on me, they wanna know

[Chorus 1]
""Hank, why do you drink, Hank, why do you roll smoke?
Why must you live out the songs that you wrote?""
Over and over, everybody made my prediction
So, if I get stoned, I'm just carrying on an old family tradition

[Verse 2]
I am very proud of my daddy's name
Although his kind of music and mine ain't exactly the same
Stop and think it over, put yourself in my position
If I get stoned and sing all night long, it's a family tradition
So don't ask me

[Chorus 2]
""Hank, why do you drink, Hank, why do you roll smoke?
Why must you live out the songs that you wrote?""
If I'm down in a honky-tonk and some ol' slick's trying to give me friction
I say, ""Leave me alone, I'm singing all night long, it's a family tradition""

[Verse 3]
Lordy, I have loved some ladies, and I have loved Jim Beam
And they both tried to kill me in 1973
When that doctor asked me, ""Son, how'd you get in this condition?""
I said, ""A-hey, Sawbones, I'm just carrying on an old family tradition""
So don't ask me

[Chorus 3]
""Hank, why do you drink, Hank, why do you roll smoke?
Why must you live out the songs that you wrote?""
Stop and think it over, try to put yourself in my unique position
If I get stoned and sing all night long, it's a family tradition"
Hank Williams Jr,Dinosaur,"[Verse 1]
Hey man, them ain't high heel sneakers
And they sure don't look like cowboy boots
And that ain't rock and roll you're playin'
And it sure ain't country or rhythm and blues

[Verse 2]
You're singin' a song about makin' love to your drummer
Well, gay guitar pickers don't turn me on
And we don't all get into Donna Summer
Do you happen to know any ol' Hank Williams songs?

[Chorus]
'Cause you see I'm a dinosaur
I should have died out a long time before
Have pity on a dinosaur
Hand me my hat, excuse me man, but where's the door?

[Verse 3]
Used to be I had a lot of fun in this old hangout
We'd get stoned at the jukebox and stay out of fights
Now and then, light a little smoke in the truck out back
Then a little old Jim Beam and we'd get right

[Verse 4]
And you know these flashin' lights sure make me dizzy
And this disco's very strange to my ears
It looks like they've turned the Longhorn into a spaceship
And I'll be leavin' just as soon as I finish this beer

[Chorus]
'Cause you see I'm a dinosaur
Should have died out a long time before
There's a whole lot of dinosaurs
So give us our hats, excuse me man, but where's the door?

[Outro]
Get us our hats
Excuse me, man
But where's the door?"
Hank Williams Jr,If the South Woulda Won,"[Chorus]
If the South woulda won, we woulda had it made
I'd probably run for President of the Southern States
The day Elvis passed away would be our national holiday
If the South woulda won, we woulda had it made

[Verse 1]
I'd make my Supreme Court down in Texas
And we wouldn't have no killers getting off free
If they were proven guilty, then they would swing quickly
Instead of writing books and smiling on TV
We'd all learn Cajun cooking in Louisiana
And I'd put that capital back in Alabama
We'd put Florida on the right track, cause we'd take Miami back
And throw all them pushers in the slammer

[Chorus 2]
Oh, if the south woulda won, we woulda had it made
I'd probably run for President of the Southern States
The day young Skynyrd died, we'd show our southern pride
If the south woulda won, we woulda had it made
""Play a little dixieland boys, ah yes""

[Verse 2]
I'd have all the whiskey made in Tennessee
And all the horses raised in those Kentucky hills
The national treasury would be in Tupelo, Mississippi
And I'd put Hank Williams picture on one hundred dollar bills
I'd have all the cars made in the Carolinas
And I'd ban all the ones made in China
I'd have every girl child sent to Georgia to learn to smile
And talk with that southern accent that drives men wild

[Bridge]
I'd have all the fiddles made in Virginia
Cause they sure can make 'em sound so fine
I'm going up on Wolverton Mountain and see ole Clifton Clowers
And have a sip of his good ole Arkansas wine

[Chorus 3]
Hey, if the South woulda won we'd a had it made
I'd probably run for President of the Southern States
When Patsy Cline passed away, that would be our national holiday
If the South woulda won, we'd a had it made, olay he hee hee
I said if the South woulda won, we would a had it made

[Outro]
Might even be better off"
Hank Williams Jr,The American Way,"[Verse 1]
If you fly in from Birmingham
You'll get the last gate
If you blew in from Boston
No, you sure won't have to wait

[Chorus]
And I'm learnin' a little more every day
Aww, 'bout the power of the dollar
And the people with white collars
And the good old American way

[Verse 2]
I've noticed I don't get much help
When they see my blue jeans
Some slick with a suit walks up
""Oh, can I help you, please?""

[Chorus]
Yes, I'm learnin' as I gain a little age
Aww, 'bout the power of the dollar
And the people with white collars
And the good old American way

[Verse 3]
Some high society lady says
""Is your horse outside?""
""No, ma'am he's between my legs
But you're too fat to ride!""

[Chorus]
And you're learnin' a little more about my ways
And what I think about your dollar
And your white collar
And your good old American way

[Verse 4]
If you don't like my Nudie boots
I'm sorry about that
Don't make fun of my hat too
Or you might get knocked flat

[Chorus]
And you'll learn some more if you ever pass down our way
Aww, 'bout the folks without the dollars
And without white collars
Hell, they are the American way"
Hank Williams Jr,The Conversation,"[Verse 1: Waylon Jennings, Hank Williams Jr, & Both]
Hank, let's talk about your daddy
Tell me how your mama loved that man
Well just break out a bottle, Hoss
I'll tell you about the driftin' cowboy band
We won't talk about the habits
Just the music and the man
That's all

[Verse 2: Waylon Jennings, Hank Williams Jr, & Both]
Now Hank, if you just got to tell me
Did your daddy really write all them songs, did he?
That don't deserve no answer, hossL
Et's light up and just move along
Do you think he wrote 'em about your mama
Or about the man who done her wrong?
You know that

[Chorus: Waylon Jennings, Hank Williams Jr, & Both]
Well back then they called him crazy
Nowadays they call him a saint
Now the ones that called him crazy
Are still ridin' on his name

[Verse 3: Waylon Jennings, Hank Williams Jr, & Both]
Well if he was here right now, Bocephus
Would he think that we were right, do you think he might?
Don't you know he would, Watasha
Be right by our side
If we left for a show in Provo
He'd be the first one on the bus and ready to ride
""I just wanna go hoss!""

[Verse 4: Waylon Jennings, Hank Williams Jr, & Both]
Wherever he is I hope he's happy
And I hope he's doin' well, yes I do
He is, 'cause he's got one arm around my mama now
How he sure did love Miss Audrey and raisin' hell
I won't ask you no more questions
To the stories only Hank could tell

[Chorus: Waylon Jennings, Hank Williams Jr, & Both]
Well back then they called him crazy
Nowadays they call him a saint
Most folks don't know that they fired him from the Opry
And that caused him the greatest pain

[Verse 5: Waylon Jennings, Hank Williams Jr, & Both]
I loved to tell you about lovesick
And how Miss Audrey loved that man
You know I've always loved to listen
To the stories about that driftin' cowboy band, yes man
You know when we get right down to it
Still the most wanted outlaws in the land"
Hank Williams Jr,All My Rowdy Friends (Have Settled Down),"[Verse 1]
All my rowdy friends have settled down
And they seem to be more into laid back songs
Nobody wants to get drunk and get loud
Everybody just wants to go back home

[Verse 2]
I, myself, have seen my wilder days
And I have seen my name at the top of the page
But I need to find a friend just to run around
But nobody wants to get high on the town
And all my rowdy friends have settled down

[Chorus 1]
And I think I know what my father meant when he sang about a ""Lost Highway""
And old George Jones, I'm glad to see, is finally getting straight
And Waylon's staying home and loving Jessi more these days
And nobody wants to get drunk and get loud
And all my rowdy friends have settled down

[Bridge]
Ow!

[Verse 3]
And the hangovers hurt more than they used to
And corn bread and ice teas took the place of pills and 90-proof
And it seems like none of us do things quite like we used to do
And nobody wants to get high on the town
And all my rowdy friends have settled down

[Chorus 2]
Yeah, I think I know what my father meant when he sang about a ""Lost Highway""
And Johnny Cash don't act like he did back in '68
And Kris, he is a movie star and he's moved off to L.A..
And nobody wants to get drunk and get loud
And all my rowdy friends have settled down

[Outro]
Yeah, me and my rowdy friends done rowdied on down"
Hank Williams Jr,Weatherman,"[Verse 1]
Mr. Weatherman
What is your forecast?
I need a major change
I can't stand no more rain

[Verse 2]
Everything's been goin' wrong
Please, tell me it's something in the ozone
Or is the atmospheric pressure just too strong?
I can't ride out one more storm

[Chorus]
'Cause I've had too many highs and too many lows
Too many storms and tornadoes
I need some blue skies and sunshine
I need a good forecast tonight

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
'Cause I've had too many highs and too many lows
Too many storms and tornadoes
I need some blue skies and sunshine
I need a good outlook tonight

[Outro]
Hope your weekend forecast is bright
Hope you got me on your weather eye"
Hank Williams Jr,I’ve Got Rights,"[Verse 1]
I went down to the Mary Carter paint store
I said, ""Give me one of them Smith & Wesson Magnum .44s""
'Cause there's a man that the law let loose and justice was not done
This man, he killed my wife and my only little son

[Verse 2]
I'll never forget the way he looked all through the trial
He had his big-name lawyer and he had that smirky smile
Woah, yeah, he got you off on a technicality
But you have to grow wings and fly to ever get away from me

[Chorus]
'Cause I got rights, I got rights too
And this time there won't be no damn lawyers and systems to protect you
But I'm gonna read you, I'm gonna read you your rights
You got a right to know that you gonna go to hell one of these black nights

[Verse 3]
And when the trial was over, he had the nerve to say, ""That's the way it goes""
I said, ""Well, Hoss, you'd better get you some corks, 'cause you're gonna have to plug up a few holes""
Guess he thought I was talkin' just to pass away time
But he kinda looks different now on his knees, beggin' for his life

[Chorus]
Hey, I got rights, I got some rights too
And this time there won't be no damn lawyers and systems to protect you
But I'm gonna read you, I'm gonna read you your rights
Because I want you to know that you're gonna go to hell one of these black nights

[Outro]
Naw, and this time there ain't no damn lawyers and systems to save you"
Hank Williams Jr,O.D.’d in Denver,"[Verse 1]
We started the tour out in Denver Colorado
I made the first one but I did not make the second show
'Cause I met this girl there that brought about quite a big change
But I OD'd in Denver and I just can't remember her name

[Verse 2]
I guess you could say that my love life would not up to par
Too many nights alone had left some permanent scars
She told me she'd love me and I told her I'd do the same
Then I OD'd in Denver and I just can't remember her name

[Chorus]
I brought it on myself and I guess that I shouldn't complain
Doc said, ""Son, you can't do anymore of that cocaine""
But she made me higher than all of those expensive things
But I OD'd in Denver and wish I could remember her name

[Verse 3]
I turned to other things tryin' to make my daydreams real
But they don't take the place of the woman's face and her feel
She treated me nice and I'd like to find her again
But I OD'd in Denver and I just can't remember her name

[Chorus]
I brought it on myself and I guess that I shouldn't complain
Doc said, ""Son, you can't do anymore of that cocaine""
But she made me higher than all of those expensive things
But I OD'd in Denver and wish I could remember her name

[Refrain]
Kinda overdid it in Denver and I just can't remember her name"
Hank Williams Jr,The Blues Man,"[Verse 1]
I'm just a singer, a natural-born guitar ringer
Kind of a clinger to sad old songs
I'm not a walk-behinder, I'm a new note finder
But my name's a reminder of a blues man that's already gone

[Verse 2]
So I started drinkin', took things that messed up my thinkin'
I was sure sinkin' when you came along
I was alone in the hot lights, not too much left in sight
But she changed all that one night when she sang me this song

[Chorus]
""Hey baby, I love you, hey baby, I need you
Hey baby, you ain't got to prove to me you're some kind of macho man
You've wasted so much of your life, runnin' through the dark nights
Let me shine some love light, down on the blues man""

[Verse 3]
I got so sick from speedin', all the stuff they said I wasn't needin'
If I was to keep pleasin' all of my fans
I got cuffed on dirt roads, I got sued over no-shows
But she came and took all that old load down off this blues man

[Chorus]
Hey baby, I love you too, hey baby, I need you
Hey baby, I do get tired of this travelin' band
I'm 30 years old now, nights would be cold now
If you hadn't stuck it out with this blues man

[Outro]
I'm 30 years old now, nights sure would be cold now
If you hadn't hung around with this blues man"
Hank Williams Jr,Ballad of Hank Williams,"[Intro]
Don, tell us how it really was when you was workin' with daddy

[Verse 1: Don Helms]
Well, in 1950 I took a little nip
Along with Mr. Williams on the way to Mississipp'
We was stacked eight deep in a Packard limousine
And we met this promoter in the town of New Orleans

[Verse 2: Hank Williams Jr., Don Helms]
Well, the man told daddy that he had what it took
And he liked the way he sang and he liked the way he shook
He said pretty soon he'd make us all rich
And we started believin' that fat sum bitch

[Verse 3: Hank Williams Jr., Don Helms]
Now daddy told the man if you wanna make some dough
Take a little money and book me on a show
And we played them dates and we filled the places well
But, Hank, he'd done blowed the profits all to hell

[Chorus: Don Helms, Hank Williams Jr.]
'Cause he'd run through a ten and he'd run through a twenty
And he'd run through a hundred just as fast as it could go
Like a big dose of sauce to a little bitty feller
He'd spend a thousand dollars on a hundred dollar show

[Verse 4: Don Helms]
Hank looked at me with a funny lookin' grin
Said, ""I've been to the Opry and I'm goin' back again""
We met the owner in a little office there
A big fat fella with some artificial hair

[Verse 5: Don Helms, Hank Williams Jr.]
He told Hank, he wanted half of everything he made
Or he'd have to tell Audrey 'bout some women Hank had laid
And you told daddy he'd better get smart
Get rid of them fellas and make a new start
[Chorus: Don Helms, Hank Williams Jr.]
Then he fired my ass and he fired Jerry Rivers
And he fired everybody just as hard as he could go
He fired old Cedric and he fired Sammy Pruitt
And he fired some people that he didn't even know

[Verse 6: Hank Williams Jr., Don Helms]
Well, every song he made, it went to number one
Y'all was workin' like hell and he was havin' fun
We was ridin' every day and playin' every night
And every twenty minutes some of us had a fight

[Verse 7: Hank Williams Jr., Don Helms]
Now, daddy he was makin' money hand over fist
And y'all was gettin' screwed but you wasn't gettin' kissed
Yeah, I told him to pass a little bit around
But he said he'd rather send it to his folks in Alabam'

[Chorus: Hank Williams Jr., Don Helms]
So he fired your ass and he fired Jerry Rivers
And he fired everybody just as hard as he could go
He fired old Cedric and he fired Sammy Pruitt
And he fired some people that he didn't even know

[Verse 8: Hank Williams Jr., Don Helms]
Now the owner of the Opry, he's a-doin' pretty good
He's got a music company that they call Cedarwood
And Hank played nothin' but sold out halls
And I was pumpin' gas in greasy overalls

[Chorus: Don Helms, Hank Williams Jr.]
'Cause he fired my ass and he fired Jerry Rivers
And he fired everybody just as hard as he could go
He fired old Cedric and he fired Sammy Pruitt
And he fired some people that he didn't even know

[Chorus: Don Helms, Hank Williams Jr.]
Hank run through a fifty and he'd run through a hundred
And he'd run through a thousand just as hard as he could go
Buyin' Cadillac Coupes, payin' double alimony
And he fired some people that he didn't even know

[Outro: Hank Williams Jr., Don Helms]
Don, you know, you used to work for me one time
I sure remember that, but come to think of it you fired my ass back in 1972
Oh, well, it's a family tradition ya know?
Yep, yep, yep
But I kept Jerry Rivers
Right, right"
Hank Williams Jr,Whiskey Bent and Hell Bound,"[Verse 1]
I've got a good woman at home who thinks I do no wrong
But sometimes, Lord, she just ain't always around
And you know that's when I fall, now I can't help myself at all
And I get whiskey bent and hell bound

[Chorus]
Play me some songs about a ramblin' man
Put a cold one in my hand
'Cause you know I love to hear those guitar sounds
Don't you play ""I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry""
'Cause I'll get all balled up inside
And I'll get whiskey bent and hell bound

[Verse 2]
Sure enough about closin' time, 'bout stoned out of my mind
And I end up with some honky tonk special I found
Just as sure as the morning sun comes, thinking of my sweet girl at home
And I need to get whiskey bent and hell bound

[Chorus]
Play me the songs about ramblin' man
Put old Jim Beam in my hand
'Cause you know I still love to get drunk and hear country sounds
But don't play ""Your Cheatin' Heart""
'Cause that'll tear me all apart
I'll get whiskey bent and hell bound

[Outro]
Yeah, old Hank's songs always make me feel low down"
Hank Williams Jr,Texas Women,"[Verse 1]
I've got some fond memories of San Angelo
And I've seen some beauty queens in El Paso
But the best lookin women that I've ever seen
Have all been in Texas and all wearin' jeans

[Chorus]
I'm a country plowboy, not an urban cowboy
And I don't ride bulls but I have fought some men
Drive a pickup truck, trust in God and luck
And I live to love Texas women

[Verse 2]
I thought I'd seen beauty in faraway places
'Til I looked upon those Houston faces
Spent Hollywood nights up in Beverly Hills
But they weren't nothin like one night down in Brownsville

[Chorus]
I'm a country plowboy, not an urban cowboy
And I don't ride bulls but I have fought some men
Drive a pickup truck, trust in God and luck
And I live to love Texas women

[Verse 3]
I'm a pretty fair judge of the opposite sex
And I ain't seen nothin that will touch 'em yet
They may be from Waco or out in Lampasas
But one thing about it they all come from Texas

[Chorus]
I'm a country plowboy, not an urban cowboy
And I don't ride bulls but I have fought some men
Drive a pickup truck, trust in God and luck
And I live to love Texas women

[Verse 4]
I'm an Oiler fan, not a soccer man
And my arms are red and so is my blood
And they make it boil with that soft Texas drawl
And I love em all, Texas women"
Hank Williams Jr,Kaw-Liga,"[Verse 1]
Kaw-Liga was a wooden Indian standin' over by the door
Fell in love with a Choctaw maid over in the Georgia store
Kaw-Liga, ooh, standin' there, don't never let it show
She don't ever answer, yes or no

[Verse 2]
He always wore his Sunday feathers and carried his old blackhawk
Maiden wore her beads and braids and hoped someday he'd talk
Kaw-Liga, ooh, standin' there, don't never show a sign
'Cause his heart is made of knotty pine

[Chorus]
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga, you ain't never got a kiss
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga, you don't know what you what miss
Is it any wonder that your face is red?
Kaw-Liga, you poor old wooden head

[Verse 3]
Kaw-Liga was a lonely Indian, never went nowhere
Heart was set on the Choctaw maid wearin' the long, black hair
Kaw-Liga, ooh, standin' there, don't never show a sign
'Cause his heart was made of knotty pine

[Verse 4]
And then one day, a wealthy customer bought the Indian maid
Took her oh so far away and ol' Kaw-Liga stayed
Kaw-Liga, ooh, standin' there, as lonesome as can be
Ah, just wishin' he were still an ol' pine tree

[Chorus]
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga, you just ain't never had no kissin'
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga, hoss, you don't know what you're missin'
Is it any wonder, that your face is red?
Kaw-Liga, you poor, ol' wooden head

[Outro]
Just a head
Just a head"
Hank Williams Jr,Outlaw’s Reward,"[Verse 1]
I've always been labeled as a rip-roarin', hell-raisin' kind
But you know, here lately I got other things on my mind
Like livin' and dyin' and where I'll spend eternity
What kind of reward, Jesus, have you got out on me?

[Verse 2]
Down here on earth, there's a big price on my head
I've got all my friends and my loved ones who'll cry when I'm dead
And someday we'll all sing along from the other side
'Cause I've heard that everyone's wanted behind your heavenly gates in the sky

[Chorus]
What kind of reward, Jesus, have you got on me?
I wonder how the words on my big wanted poster do read
And oh how I'd love to be taken into your custody
What kind of reward, Jesus, have you got on me?

[Chorus]
What kind of reward, Jesus, have you got on me?
I wonder how the words on my big wanted poster do read
And oh how I'd love to be taken into your custody
What kind of reward, Jesus, have you got on me?"
Hank Williams Jr,Old Habits,"[Verse 1]
I kicked the habit of smoking back sometime ago
And I tried the hard stuff but I had to let all that go
But the toughest thing I ever gave up was today
'Cause old habits like you are hard to break

[Verse 2]
I used lifesavers to help me get off cigarettes
But you know for your love, I ain't found no lifesavers yet
And I've gone cold turkey 'cause there's not even one kiss a day
And old habits like you are hard to break

[Chorus]
Old habits like you are hard to break
Love with someone new is so hard to make
I had grown so used to you and all of your ways
And old habits like you are hard to break"
Hank Williams Jr,The American Dream,"[Verse 1]
Too many lawyers in football, baseball's got a few
The pitcher got a million dollars and the quarterback he got two
The pitcher threw his arm away and the quarterback ruined his knee
And this they did so they could live the American dream

[Verse 2]
Now there are some preachers on TV with a suit and a tie and a vest
They want you to send your money to the Lord, but they give you their address,
'Cause all of your donations are completely tax-free
God bless you all, but most of all, send your money

[Chorus]
Do you really want it, do you really need it?
You gotta keep on grindin' just to try to keep it
You got no time for yourself, you got more for old Jim Beam,
You're goin' crazy dreamin' the American dream

[Verse 3]
Reagan is a cuttin' the budget, makin' the Democrats scream
Says we gotta control inflation, quit spending our money on everything
But this year's tax increase, why, it's the biggest in history,
'Round and around we go, where we stop, who knows, the American dream

[Chorus]
Do we really want it, do you really need it?
You gotta keep on grindin' just to try to keep it
We got no time for yourselves, we got more for old Jim Beam,
We're goin' crazy dreamin' the American dream

[Outro]
We're goin' crazy dreamin' the American dream
Hail to the chief   "
Hank Williams Jr,Whiskey on Ice,"[Verse 1]
Woke up this mornin' tastin' Jim Beam
Holdin' the answer to some ol' boys dream
I got a bad reputation, guess I made life wild
I like my whiskey on ice and my women on fire

[Verse 2]
From Memphis to Mobile, I've played all the die
Lord knows I'm lucky just to still be alive
I'm an all around rebel and I won't be denied
I like my whiskey on ice and my women on fire

[Chorus 1]
I like my whiskey on ice, my women on fire
Like a good soundin' guitar and won't be called a liar
I spent many long night with a burnin' desire
Pour my whiskey on ice and my women on fire

[Verse 3]
Some folks talk about me, guess they always will
They think it's been an easy ride and all been downhill
What they don't think about, what they don't realize
Is the shoes that I'm fillin' are a mighty big size

[Verse 4]
One night in Nashville, I tried to take my life
'Cause my friends had all left me and so had my wife
But a fast flight to Florida made me realize
I had some whiskey on ice and some Florida women on fire

[Chorus 1]
I like my whiskey on ice, my women on fire
Like a good soundin' guitar and won't be called a liar
I spent many long nights with a burnin' desire
Pour my whiskey on ice and my women on fire

[Chorus 2]
I like my whiskey on ice, women on fire
Like a good feelin' guitar and won't be called a liar
I may grow old, but I'll never grow tired
Of my whiskey on ice and my women, women on fire"
Hank Williams Jr,Outlaw Women,"[Verse 1]
She works in a bank and she works in a store
And she don't go for that old stuff anymore
She likes to get high and listen to the band
She likes to make love to her kind of man

[Chorus 1]
These outlaw women, first of their kind
Outlaw women, they got you right on time
Outlaw women don't need any guns
Outlaw women, just out of fun

[Verse 2]
In a way she's a lot like me
She don't give a damn 'bout society
Might be little rich girl, she might be poor
Might be a married woman that needs a little more

[Chorus 2]
She's a outlaw woman, first of the kind
These outlaw women, ridin' high in '79
These outlaw women, don't need any guns
These outlaw women, just out of fun"
Hank Williams Jr,If Heaven Ain’t a Lot Like Dixie,"[Intro]
If heaven ain't a lot like Dixie
I don't want to go
If heaven ain't a lot like Dixie
I'd just as soon stay home

[Verse 1]
I was one of the chosen few to be born in Alabam'
I'm just like my daddy's son, I'm proud of who I am
I went through a lot of good women
And shook old Jim Beam's hand
If I never see the pearly gates
I've walked through the promised land

[Chorus]
If heaven ain't a lot like Dixie
I don't want to go
If heaven ain't a lot like Dixie
I'd just as soon stay home
If they don't have a Grand Ole Opry
Like they do in Tennessee
Just send me to hell or New York City
It would be about the same to me

[Verse 2]
I've got wild honey trees and crazy little weeds
Growing around my shack
These dusty roads ain't streets of gold
But I'm a happy right where I'm at
All these pretty little southern belles are a country boy's dream
They ain't got wings or halos, but they sure lookin' good to me

[Chorus]
If heaven ain't a lot like Dixie
I don't want to go
If heaven ain't a lot like Dixie
I'd just as soon stay home
If they don't have a Grand Ole Opry
Like they do down in Tennessee
Just send me to hell or New York City
It would be about the same to me
If heaven ain't a lot like Dixie
I don't want to go
If heaven ain't a lot like Dixie
I'd just as soon stay home
If heaven ain't a lot like Dixie
I don't want to go
If heaven ain't a lot like Dixie
I'd just as soon stay home
If they ain't got a Grand Ole Opry
Like they do in Tennessee
Just send me to hell or New York City
It would be about the same to me"
Hank Williams Jr,Mr. Lincoln,"[Chorus]
Mr. Lincoln, I wish you were here
The Republic's changed a lot in a hundred years
And I don't think it's working like you planned
Oh, Mr. Lincoln, we could use a hand

[Verse 1]
I just read the headlines in The Nashville News
And I wish I'd made this up, but I'm afraid it's true
'Cause a man was murdered for his money in the street
He was takin' his wife to a nice place to eat

[Verse 2]
When they caught the man
He did twenty-three months of time
He pled insanity like they do now all the time
Sir, what would you have done in 1859?

[Verse 3]
Now if you shoot someone, sir, you can get off scot-free
It's the latest thing, Mr. Lincoln, can you believe?
Now they sue the manufacturers of the guns
Ain't the law changed a lot since 1861?

[Chorus]
Mr. Lincoln, I wish you were here
'Cause things have changed a lot in a hundred years
And I don't think it's working out like you planned
Hey, Mr. Lincoln, we sure could use a hand

[Verse 4]
I just heard the news story on the radio
They let dangerous men out of prisons now, yes sir I'm afraid it's so
'Cause they're overcrowded, and it was only his fifth offense
Yeah, and this time he's killed someone, does that make any sense?

[Verse 5]
Now, my lawyer called me about a nuisance case
'Cause everybody sues over any little thing these days
Well, at least we're right, all we gotta do is tell the truth
He said, ""You're living in the past, you romantic fool""
I said, ""You've got that right, I lean toward the older ways
And there's damn few backwoods lawyers left today""

[Chorus]
Mr. Lincoln, I wish you were here
The Republic's changed a lot in a hundred years
And I don't think it's working like you planned
Hey, Mr. Lincoln, we sure could use a hand

[Chorus]
Mr. Lincoln, please, could you come here?
'Cause things have changed a lot in a hundred years
And I don't think it's working out like you planned
Mr. Lincoln, we sure could use a hand"
Hank Williams Jr,Man of Steel,"[Verse 1]
Now my daddy died when I was three
My mama didn't bounce me on her knee
My grandma and grandpa is done passed on
That kinda left me all alone
My wife took off after our first child
Oh, my kinda ramblin' life wasn't her kinda style
So I kinda got toughened up and hard learned not to feel
They started callin' the man of steel

[Chorus]
And my friends all call me Superman
I never let a woman get the upper hand
Lord, I don't know now what I'm gonna do
The man of steel's done got the blues

[Verse 2]
Now I've been hurt inside and out
Some of you know what I'm talkin' about
You'll think your poor heart will never, never heal
And you'll wish you were the man of steel

[Chorus]
My friends all call me Superman
I never let nobody get the upper hand
Lord, I don't know now what I'm goin' to do
'Cause the man of steel done got the blues

[Bridge]
Dirty women, they give me the blues

[Verse 3]
No woman ever got the best of me
I couldn't walk right out with ease
'Til I fell in love and then she walked out
The man of steel got melted down
Now I can't sleep and I can't eat
Can't watch no love scenes on TV
And I don't know what I'm goin' to
The man of steel done got the blues

[Chorus]
My friends all call me Superman
And Superman never let no woman get an upper hand
Lord, I don't know now what I'm gonna do
And the man of steel's done got the blues
Lord, I don't know now what I'm gonna do
Even old Superman gets the blues

[Outro]
Yeah, that woman, she gave me the blues"
Hank Williams Jr,Dixie on My Mind,"[Verse 1]
All the stations up here, they don't sign off with ""Dixie""
The way they did in sweet home Alabam'
And the people here don't sip Jack Daniels whiskey
The way they do in the Tennessee mountain land

[Verse 2]
I'd always heard lots about the big apple
So I thought I'd come up here and see
But all I've seen so far is one big hassle
Wish I was camped out on the Okeechobee

[Chorus 1]
If this is the promised land, I've had all I can stand
And I'm headed back below that Dixie line
No, I just don't fit in and I'll never come back again
But I'm busted here and I got Dixie on my mind
Oh, and I'm stuck up here and I got Dixie on my mind

[Verse 3]
These people never smile or say a word
They're all too busy trying to make an extra dime
Oh, I'd love to haul 'em all down around Spartanburg
And show 'em how they raise hell in Caroline

[Verse 4]
Oh, the things you know that I miss most of all
Is the freedom of the rivers and the pines
They don't do much huntin' and fishin' up here, you know
But I have met a few squirrels and one porcupine

[Chorus 2]
Well if this is the promised land, I've had all I can stand
Wish I was down in Houston town tonight
No, I just don't fit in and I'll never come back again
But I'm busted here and I got Dixie on my mind
Oh, and I'm stuck up here and got Dixie on my mind"
Hank Williams Jr,America Will Survive,"[Verse 1]
People think we're nearing the end of time
But we've had enough and we've drawn the line
Our flag is up since our people went down
And we're together from the country to town
We live back in the woods you see
Big city problems never bothered me
But now the world has changed and so have I
And America can survive, America will survive
We can plow our fields all day long
We can catch our fish from dusk 'til dawn
Yeah, we have toughed it out a time or two
These are dark days but we're gonna pull through
We grow good old tomatoes, we got hometown pride
America can survive, America is gonna survive

[Chorus]
'Cause you can't scare us out, you can't make us run
What we got here is freedom and fun
We say grace and we say ""ma'am""
If they don't like that, we don't give a damn

[Verse 2]
We came from the West Virginia coal mines
The Rocky Mountains and the big city skylines
Hey, we can hit back and we're gonna be fine
'Cause this old country can survive, America can survive
I had a good friend in New York City
Never called me Hank, he called me hillbilly
My grandpa taught me how to live off the land
And his taught him to be a street-smart man
He used to send me pictures of the Broadway lights
And I'd send him some of that homemade scufflin' wine
He was lost like so many in the terrible strife
And we're all askin' God, now ""Why, oh, why?""
I read, ""A tooth for a tooth and a eye for an eye""
And that's an old slogan we're gonna revive
'Cause America can survive
America will survive

[Chorus]
'Cause you can't scare us out, you can't 'em us run
We're the boys and girls that have freedom and fun
We say grace and we say ""ma'am""
If they don't like that, we give less than a damn

[Outro]
We're from North California and South Alabam'
And all they've done is unite the whole land
There's no more Yankees and Rebels this time
But one united people that stand behind
America can survive, America will survive
America can survive, America is gonna survive"
Charlie Rich,The Most Beautiful Girl,"[Chorus]
Hey, did you happen to see
The most beautiful girl in the world
And if you did, was she crying, crying
Hey, if you happen to see
The most beautiful girl that walked out on me
Tell her I'm sorry, tell her I need my baby
Oh, won't you tell her that I love her

[Verse]
I woke up this morning
Realized what I had done
I stood alone in the cold gray dawn
I knew I'd lost my morning sun
I lost my head and I said some things
Now comes the heartache that morning brings
I know I'm wrong and I couldn't see
I let my world slip away from me

[Chorus]
So hey, did you happen to see
The most beautiful girl in the world
And if you did, was she crying, crying
Hey, if you happen to see
The most beautiful girl that walked out on me
Tell her I'm sorry, tell her I need my baby
Oh, won't you tell her that I love her

[Tag]
Did you happen to see
The most beautiful girl that walked out on me
Tell her I'm sorry, tell her I need my baby
Oh, won't you tell her that I love her..."
Charlie Rich,Behind Closed Doors,"[Verse 1]
My baby makes me proud
Lord, don't she make me proud
She never makes a scene
By hangin' all over me in a crowd
'Cause people like to talk
Lord, don't they love to talk

[Pre-Chorus]
But when they turn out the lights
I know she'll be leavin' with me

[Chorus]
And when we get behind closed doors
Then she lets her hair hang down
And she makes me glad that I'm a man
Oh, no one knows what goes on behind closed doors

[Verse 2]
My baby makes me smile
Lord, don't she make me smile
She's never far away
Or too tired to say ""I want you""
She's always a lady
Just like a lady should be

[Pre-Chorus]
But when they turn out the lights
She's still a baby to me

[Chorus]
'Cause when we get behind closed doors
Then she lets her hair hang down
And she makes me glad I'm a man
Oh, no one knows what goes on behind closed doors
Behind closed doors!"
Charlie Rich,Rollin’ With The Flow,"[Verse 1]
Once was a thought inside my head
'Fore I'd reach thirty I'd be dead
Now somehow on and on I go
I keep on rollin' with the flow

[Verse 2]
Folks said that I would change my mind
I'd straighten up and do just fine
Ah, but I still love rock and roll
I keep on rollin' with the flow

[Chorus]
While guys my age are raising kids
I'm raisin' hell just like I did
I've got a lot of crazy friends
And they forgive me of my sins

[Verse 3]
Some might be callin' me a bum
But I'm still out there havin' fun
And Jesus loves me, yes, I know
So, I keep on rollin' with the flow
(Keep on rollin' with the flow)

[Chorus]
While guys my age are raising kids
But I'm raisin' hell just like I did
I've got a lot of crazy friends
And they forgive me of my sins

[Verse 4]
Can't take it with you when you're gone
But I want enough to get there on
And I ain't ever growin' old
So, I keep on rollin' with the flow
(Keep on rollin' with the flow)
I ain't ever growin' old
If I keep on rollin' with the flow
(Keep on rollin', keep on rollin')

[Outro]
Keep on rollin' with the flow
(Keep on rollin', keep on rollin')
Keep on rollin' with the flow
(Keep on rollin', keep on rollin')"
Charlie Rich,Feel Like Going Home,"Lord I feel like going home
I tried and failed and I`m tired and weary
Everything I ever done was wrong
And I feel like going home

Lord I tried to see it through
But it was too much for me
And now I`m coming home to you
And I feel like going home

Cloudy skies are rolling in
And not a friend around to help me
From all the places I have been
And I feel like going home

Repeat 1st verse"

On my knees, I ask you please
Honey, let me love you
Let me kiss you like I used to

Who will the next fool be?
I know, I know, I know, I know
There's things I gotta know
'bout the woman I love
And after all is said and done
Girl, you wouldn't be satisfied with anyone

Charlie Rich,Life Has It’s Little Up’s And Downs,"[Verse 1]
I don't know how to tell her
That I didn't get that raise in pay today
And I know how much she wanted the dress in Baker's window
And it breaks my heart to see her have to wait
And cancel all the plans she made to celebrate

[Pre-Chorus]
But I can count on her to take it with a smile and not a frown

[Chorus]
She knows that life has its little ups and downs
Like ponies on a merry-go-round
And no one grabs the brass ring every time
But she don't mind
She wears a gold ring on her finger
And it's mine

[Verse 2]
The new house plans we've had so long
I guess will gather dust another year
And the daffodils are blooming that she planted way last fall
Up on the hill and over by the gate
And Lord knows I hate to say again we'll have to wait

[Pre-Chorus]
But you can bet that she'll just take it with a smile and not a frown

[Chorus]
'Cause she knows that life has its little ups and downs
Like ponies on a merry-go-round
And no one grabs the brass ring every time
But she don't mind
She wears a gold ring on her finger
And I'm so glad that it's mine
She wears a gold ring on her finger
And I'm so glad that it's mine"
Charlie Rich,I’ll Wake You Up,"I spent the day just missing you remembering your touch
Counting all the reasons why I love you oh so much
In my thoughts you're always with me, every hour, every day
And if I could be with you right now here's what I'd love to say

I'll wake you up, when I get home
I know you won't care what time it is
'Cause I've been gone, so very long
And honey I've got so much love to give
You know our bed is big and lonesome
When your sleeping all alone
I'm your man and you're my woman
I'll wake you up, when I get home

There's a nightlight in the bedroom you left it on so I could see
When I turn the sheets back you'll be waiting there for me
I dream each night when we're apart I'm making love to you
Now I'll wake you up, and hold you close, and make our dreams come true

I'll wake you up, when I get home
I know you won't care what time it is
'Cause I've been gone, so very long
And honey I've got so much love to give
You know our bed is big and lonesome
When your sleeping all alone
I'm your man and you're my woman
I'll wake you up, when I get home"
Charlie Rich,Every Time You Touch Me (I Get High),"Every time you touch me
I get high
And every time you're near me
I can fly

High above the clouds and rain
Way above the hurt and pain
And when you're gone
I fall down from the sky

But every time you touch me
I get high

I've been touched by the angels
And I've been kissed by the very best
And I've been love hard by quite a few
But after you
I forget the rest

'Cause every time you touch me
I get high
And every time you're near me
I can fly

When your fingers touch my skin
That's when I start to live again
'Cause without your love
I'd lay right down and die

Every time you touch me
I get high"
Charlie Rich,A Very Special Love Song,"[Verse 1]
Babe, somewhere I know I'm gonna find it, babe
It'll have my love behind it
And it will be a symphony of all you mean to me
A very special love song

[Verse 2]
And babe, if there's a way you know I'm gonna say it babe
If there's a melody I'll play it
And I'll play it through especially for you and all the words are true
A very special love song

[Verse 3]
So don't be surprised if you're sittin' alone and you hear it
'Cause I'm goin' to sing it to the whole big lonely world
So turn your radio way down low and get near it
And I'll tell the world I love you girl

[Verse 4]
Babe, if there's an ounce of love I'm gonna give it to you
Babe, if there's a breath of life I'm gonna live it every day for you
And all the whole night through, singin' just for you
A very special love song, for you"
Charlie Rich,’Til I Can’t Take It Anymore,"Let's not fight it anymore
Unpack your bags and close the door
Girl, I'll never leave you
Though you lied right from the start
I can't convince my foolish heart
Not to believe you
You've got two good men strung out
And there's not the slightest doubt
That other men have loved you before
But you drew your face away
I dream of Heaven and I live in Hell
Till I can't take it anymore

If I had one ounce of pride
I'd stand up or step aside
But I still love you
So I'll accept the crumbs you drop
'Cause I'm a fool and I can't stop
Or rise above you
Let them speak up for themselves
I speak for me and no one else
'Cause I'm a beggar knockin' on your door
But you do your thing so well
I dream of Heaven and I live in Hell
Till I can't take it anymore

I'm too far gone to turn around
And pick myself up off the ground
It's not all over, no
There's one of us must win or lose
No matter which one you may choose
You'll win them over (you know you will)
While you're makin' up your mind
I'll be prayin all the time
Prayin' that you'll never let me go
But you do your thing so well
I dream of Heaven and I live in Hell
Till I can't take it anymore

You work your thing so well
I dream of Heaven and I live in Hell
Till I can't take it anymore

Yeah, you do your thing so well
I dream of Heaven and I live in Hell
Till I can't take it anymore"
Charlie Rich,"July 12, 1939","July the 12th sure was a scorcher
Mama, she fixed some lemonade
Sister Beth was sunning in the sunshine
And baby Corey was playing in the shade

I looked up the road
And yonder comes a big car
Something we don't see much around here
Big man said, son, where's your pappy
Said, he's over in the cornfield
Not far from here

They started talking over by the rail fence
It looked like Papa was getting mad
They walked to the house and papa was crying
Papa never cried and I knew it was bad

Two weeks later in the Logan courthouse
Raining cats and dogs outside
Sure was awful the way mama was crying
She says she thought that woman had lied

Papa said, Judge
We tried to raise up a good boy
From a little bitty tot
Jody'd never go against
Of what a woman wishes
That kinda boy we know that he's not

You know the power of the almighty dollar
Will come out the winner every time
That Willie Buchanan done got away with something
They're trying to blame on the boy of mine

Hmmm mmm mmm...

July the 12th, 1939

Hmmm mmm mmm..."
Charlie Rich,She Called Me Baby,"She called me baby, baby all night long
Used to hold and kiss me 'til the dawn
Then one day I woke and she was gone
Now there's no more baby, baby all night long

She called me baby, baby all night long
Kissed my tears away when things went wrong
Oh what I'd give if she'd just come back home
And call me baby, baby all night long

She called me baby, baby all night long
Held me up so high and made me strong
Now each night in dreams just like a song
I still hear baby, baby
Baby, baby
Baby, baby all night long"
Charlie Rich,You Never Really Wanted Me,"You never really wanted me
Now I can see
Yes I can see
You took your love and ran away from me
You've gone and now you're back
What do you want from me?
Standing there
Please don't cry over me
After all you never cried for me before
Why start now?
Isn't it a little late for that now girl
Don't go feeling sorry for yourself
Remember I loved you
I loved you
I never knew the games we played
Had such a lasting grip upon the plans we made
I was busy laughing waiting for the day
Now our time is gone
And there's nothing left to say
Standing there
Please don't cry over me
After you never cried for me before..."
Charlie Rich,I Don’t See Me In Your Eyes Anymore,"(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
I don't see me
In your eyes anymore
Oh, why can't I
Make them shine like before?

I don't see you
(I don't see you)
Or your heart in your kiss
(doo-doo-doo-do)
That you should say
(ooooh)
That you're mine. You resist
(you resist)

There was a time
Life was fine
Love was ecstasy
But now I doubt
What the outcome will be

I pray you'll say
I'm the one you adore
Then I'll see me
(I'll see me)
In your eyes as before
(Aaaaah-aaah)

I pray you'll say
I'm the one you adore
Then I'll see me
(I'll see me)
In your eyes as before
(I'll see me as before)"
Charlie Rich,Sittin’ And Thinkin’,"[Intro]
Please baby wait for me
Wait for me
Wait for me

[Verse 1]
I got loaded last night on a bottle of gin
And I had a fight with my best girlfriend
But when I'm drinkin', I am nobody's friend
But please baby, wait for me until they let me out again

[Verse 2]
I know the same thing has happened before
And every time it does, I hate it more and more
But when I'm drinkin', I am nobody's friend
So please baby, wait for me until they let me out again

[Chorus]
I spent a whole lot of time
Sittin' and thinkin'
Sittin' and just thinkin' 'bout you
Well if I didn't spend so much time sittin' and drinkin'
We'd still have a love that we once knew

[Verse 3]
Oh, I won't promise the same thing won't happen again
But I can promise it'll be a long, long time 'til then
'Cause when I'm drinkin', I am nobody's friend
But, please baby, wait for me until they let me out again

[Outro]
Please baby, wait for me until they let me out again"
Charlie Rich,I Take It On Home,"Sometimes at the end of the day
Before I head home, I make a stop along the way
A couple of drinks, wait for the 5 o'clock rush to go by

And almost always there's a lady
Oh, and it's so hard, she starts coming on
I back it on up, turn it around and take it on home

Sometimes I've gotta go out of town
I'll be gone for a couple of days
And this buddy of mine he's a hound in the first degree

And almost always there's the ladies
And it ain't easy there out and alone
But I back it on up, turn it around, take it on home

I take it on home to a woman who sticks by me
'Cause I believe she'd do the same if she was me
And I wouldn't know where to turn to if she was gone
So when I ain't working, I don't hang out I take it on home
I back it on up, turn it around and take it on home"
Charlie Rich,Have A heart,"Would you lend a helping hand to save a drowning man
Could you refuse a hungry child a crust of bread
And if were a millionare would you have a dime to spend
For a beggar or would you turn away in the stand

(Have a heart) this man is drowning (have a heart) this child is hungry
(Have a heart) this beggar's begging you please don't walk away
(Have a heart) I'm drowning in my tears (have a heart) oh I'm hungry for your kiss
I'm begging on my knees have a heart and please love me

(Have a heart) this man is drowning (have a heart) this child is hungry
(Have a heart) this beggar's begging you please don't walk away
(Have a heart) I'm drowning in my tears (have a heart) oh I'm hungry for your kiss
I'm begging on my knees have a heart and please love me

I'm begging on my knees have a heart and please love me..."
Charlie Rich,San Francisco Is A Lonely Town,"Two happy people on a Greyhound bus
We came here looking for a life for us
But the nightlife is her new life and the only thing I've found is
San Francisco is a lonely town

Oh, there were good times for a little while
But now her new friends say I cramp her style
I guess I'm only in the way now and she don't need me hanging round
San Francisco is a lonely town

Now she's out there somewhere across the Bay
And she'll be wondering where I am when she gets in today
She'll find I've left her a oneway ticket home
And while she stands there crying all alone
And while the Greyhound keeps on rolling I'll pray the Lord she's found
San Francisco is a lonely town

San Francisco is a lonely town..."
Charlie Rich,There Won’t Be Anymore,"[Verse 1]
Don't wait for the postman
If you're looking for a letter from me
There won't be anymore
There won't be anymore
And don't sit by your telephone
If you're waiting for a call from me
There won't be anymore
There won't be anymore

[Verse 2]
Don't think of the love we had (We had)
'Til you turned bad (Turned bad)
And broke my loving heart in two
And when your heart is breaking
And you need some loving from me
There won't be anymore
There won't be anymore

[Verse 2]
Don't think of the love we had (We had)
'Til you turned bad (Turned bad)
And broke my loving heart in two
And when your heart is breaking
And you need some loving from me
There won't be anymore
There won't be anymore
It won't be like before
There just won't be anymore"
Charlie Rich,I Love My Friend,"She was crying
And I was lonely
And a band was playing
Some old love song
Someone had hurt her
And someone had left me
And We both needed something
To hold on to
Who knows
Tomorrow it might all end
But tonight I love my friend
I love my friend
And we'll make it
Maybe
Just maybe
Even though we're going to share the night
In each other's arms
I'll treat her like a lady
And I'll call her baby
Cause I love my friend
We'll make it
Maybe
Just maybe
Tomorrow when we start another day
And we don't know the way
I'll still treat her like a lady
Still call her baby
Cause I love my friend
And we'll make it
Maybe"
Charlie Rich,Anywhere You Are,"[Verse 1]
Anywhere you are
Anyplace that you may be
Whether near or far from me
You are too far from me

[Verse 2]
Whether in the night
Or maybe on the brightest day
Anytime that you're away
You are too far from me

[Chorus]
And I don't need your consolation
I only need your sweet inspiration

[Verse 3]
Anywhere you go
Baby let me go there too
'Cause I just got to be with you
Or you are too far from me

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
And I don't need your consolation
I only need your sweet inspiration

Anywhere you go
Baby let me go there too
'Cause I just got to be with you
Or you are too far from me
I just got to be with you
Or you are too far from me"
Charlie Rich,Rebound,"Look out baby I'm after you
You done something to me that you ought not do
Played me up and now you've made me blue
And I'm lonely
Well, I guess I'm on the rebound
That's what people say
I lost the only one I found
Who can make me feel this way
Yeah, and I'm lonely over you
Well, look out baby, better change your ways
You done something to me that's drivin' me crazy
Catch up with you one of these days
'Cause I'm lonely
Yeah, I guess I'm on the rebound
Guess I've lost my touch
You're the only one for me
And I love you much too much
And I'm lonely over you
You oughta be ashamed of yourself
Treatin' me this way
Didn't know what it was all about
But I'm gonna find out someday
Yeah, you better look out baby
Gonna make you mad
You're gonna miss me and the things you had
Hate to say it, but I'll be so glad
When you're lonely
Yeah, then you'll be on the rebound
I'm waiting for the day
You'll lose the only one you found
Who could make you feel this way
Yeah, you'll be lonely
You'll be lonely
You'll be lonely, just like me
Just like me
Just like me"
The Louvin Brothers,I’m Ready To Go Home,"Through the valleys of this life I have wandered
And I've worked for Jesus all along the way
But now I see the sun for me is setting
I have reached the ending of my way

Lord, I've been faithful in the service You have given
And the harvest of the fields, Lord, I have done
But now my steps are growing weary
Lord, I'm waiting, I'm ready to go home

Looking back upon the life I've lived for Jesus
I can see how He has helped me all the way
And the tears I've shed just helped to keep me humble
And each burden only taught me how to pray

Lord, I've been faithful in the service You have given
And the harvest of the fields, Lord, I have done
But now my steps are growing weary
Lord, I'm waiting, I'm ready to go home

Though I hate to leave so many friends behind me
And the parting of our ways will touch my heart
But I'll wait for them inside the gates of heaven
Where the children of God will never part

Lord, I've been faithful in the service You have given
And the harvest of the fields, Lord, I have done
But now my steps are growing weary
Lord, I'm waiting, I'm ready to go home"
The Louvin Brothers,Knoxville Girl,"[Verse 1]
I met a little girl in Knoxville, a town we all know well
And every Sunday evening, out in her home I'd dwell
We went to take an evening walk about a mile from town
I picked a stick up off the ground and knocked that fair girl down

[Verse 2]
She fell down on her bended knees for mercy she did cry
""Oh Willie dear, don't kill me here, I'm unprepared to die""
She never spoke another word, I only beat her more
Until the ground around me within her blood did flow

[Verse 3]
I took her by her golden curls and I drug her round and around
Throwing her into the river that flows through Knoxville town
Go down, go down, you Knoxville girl with the dark and rolling eye
Go down, go down, you Knoxville girl, you can never be my bride

[Verse 4]
I started back to Knoxville, got there about midnight
My mother, she was worried and woke up in a fright
Saying, ""Dear son, what have you done to bloody your clothes so?""
I told my anxious mother I was bleeding at my nose

[Verse 5]
I called for me a candle to light myself to bed
I called for me a handkerchief to bind my aching head
Rolled and tumbled the whole night through as troubles was for me
Like flames of hell around my bed and in my eyes could see

[Verse 6]
They carried me down to Knoxville and put me in a cell
My friends all tried to get me out, but none could go my bail
I'm here to waste my life away down in this dirty old jail
Because I murdered that Knoxville girl, the girl I loved so well"
The Louvin Brothers,The Great Atomic Power,"[Verse 1]
Do you fear this man's invention that they call atomic power?
Are we all in great confusion, do we know the time or hour?
When a terrible explosion may rain down upon our land
Leaving horrible destruction, blotting out the works of man

[Chorus]
Are you, are you ready for that great atomic power?
Will you rise and meet your savior in the air?
Will you shout or will you cry when the fire rains from on high?
Are you ready for that great atomic power?

[Verse 2]
There is one way to escape it, be prepared to meet the lord
Give your heart and soul to Jesus, he will be your shielding sword
He will surely stay beside you and you'll never taste of death
For your soul will fly to safety and eternal peace and rest

[Chorus]
Are you, are you ready for that great atomic power?
Will you rise and meet your savior in the air?
Will you shout or will you cry when the fire rains from on high?
Are you ready for that great atomic power?

[Verse 3]
There's an army who can conquer all the enemy's great band
It's the regiment of Christians guided by the savior's hand
When the mushroom of destruction falls in all it's fury great
God will surely save his children from that awful awful fate

[Chorus]
Are you, are you ready for that great atomic power?
Will you rise and meet your savior in the air?
Will you shout or will you cry when the fire rains from on high?
Are you ready for that great atomic power?"
The Louvin Brothers,Satan Is Real,"Satan is real, working in spirit
You can see him and hear him in this world every day
Satan is real, working with power
He can tempt you and lead you astray

I attended service at a little church
In the country not long ago
A prayer was led by an old country preacher
Who then raised his hands as everyone stood and sang
""My God is real""
A warm breeze through the open windows
Brought in the smell of new mown hay in a nearby field
And the singing of birds could be heard
In the moment of silence
As the preacher opened the bible to read
And then a little old man stood up, bent with age
His hair thin and white
And said, ""Preacher, tell them that satan is real too""
You can hear him in songs that give praise to idols
And sinful things of this world
You can see him in the destruction of homes torn apart
I know that satan is real
For once I had a happy home
I was loved and respected by my family
I was looked upon as a leader in my community
And then Satan came into my life
I grew selfish and un-neighborly
My friends turned against me
And finally, my home was broken apart
My children took their paths into a world of sin
Yes preacher, it's sweet to know that God is real
And know that in Him all things are possible
And we know that Heaven is a real place
Where joy shall never end
But sinner friend, if you're here today
Satan is real too
And hell is a real place
A place of everlasting punishment

Satan is real, working in spirit
You can see him and hear him in this world every day
Satan is real, working with power
He can tempt you and lead you astray"
The Louvin Brothers,I Don’t Believe You’ve Met My Baby,"Last night, my dear, the rain was falling
I went to bed so sad and blue
Then, I had a dream of you

I dreamed I was strolling in the evening
Underneath the harvest moon
I was thinking about you

And then we met me in the moonlight
The stars were shining in your eyes
But another was there too

""I don't believe you've met my baby""
You looked at him, you looked at me
I wondered who you were talking to

I shook the hand of your stranger
But I was shaking more inside
I was still wondering who

Your arm was resting on his shoulder
You smiled at him, he smiled at you
His eyes were filled with victory

He said, ""My sister wants to marry""
Then my heart was filled with ease
I knew that you would marry me"
The Louvin Brothers,In The Pines,"[Refrain]
In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows

[Verse 1]
Little girl, little girl, what have I done
Thats made you treat me so
You've caused me to weep, you've caused me to mourn
You've caused me to leave my home

[Refrain]
In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows

[Verse 2]
The longest train I ever saw
Went down that Georgia Line
The engine passed at six o'clock
And the cab went by at nine

[Refrain]
In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows

[Verse 3]
The longest train I ever saw
Was 19 coaches long
The only girl I ever loved
Is on that train and gone

[Refrain]
In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows"
The Louvin Brothers,Kneel At The Cross,"Kneel at the cross, Christ will meet you there
Come while He waits for you
Listen to His voice, leave with Him your cares
And begin life anew

Kneel at the cross, kneel at the cross
Leave every care, leave every care
Kneel at the cross, kneel at the cross
Jesus will meet you there

Kneel at the cross, there is room for all
Who would His glory share
Bliss there awaits, harm can nary fall
Those who are anchored there

Kneel at the cross, kneel at the cross
Leave every care, leave every care
Kneel at the cross, kneel at the cross
Jesus will meet you there

Kneel at the cross, give your idols up
Look unto realms above
Turn not away to life's sparkling cup
Trust only in His love

Kneel at the cross, kneel at the cross
Leave every care, leave every care
Kneel at the cross, kneel at the cross
Jesus will meet you there"
The Louvin Brothers,Cash on the Barrel Head,"[Verse 1]
Got in a little trouble at the county seat
Lord, they put me in the jailhouse for loafing on the street
When the judge heard the verdict, I was a guilty man
He said, ""Forty-five dollars or thirty days in the can""

[Chorus 1]
""That'll be cash on the barrel head, son
You can make your choice, you're twenty one
No money down, no credit plan
No time to chase you 'cause I'm a busy man""

[Verse 2]
Found a telephone number on a laundry slip
I had a good-hearted jailer with a six-gun hip
He let me call long distance, she said, ""Number, please""
And no sooner than I told her, she shouted out at me

[Chorus 2]
""That'll be cash on the barrel head, son
Not part, not half, but the entire sum
No money down, no credit plan
'Cause a little bird tells me you're a traveling man""

[Verse 3]
Thirty days in the jailhouse, four days on the road
I was feeling mighty hungry, my feet a heavy load
Saw a greyhound coming, stuck up my thumb
Just as I was being seated, the driver caught my arm

[Chorus 3]
Said, ""That'll be cash on the barrel head, son
This old gray dog gets paid to run
When the engine stops, Lord, the wheels won't roll
Give me cash on the barrel head, I'll take you down the road"""
The Louvin Brothers,When I Stop Dreaming,"[Chorus]
When I stop dreaming
That's when I'll stop loving you

[Verse 1]
The worst that I've ever been hurt in my life
The first time I ever have wanted to die
Was the night when you told me you loved someone else
And asked me if I could forget

[Chorus]
When I stop dreaming
That's when I'll stop wanting you

[Verse 2]
I'd be like a flower unwanted in spring
Alone and neglected, transplanted in vain
To a garden of sadness where it's petals would fall
In the shadow of undying pain

[Chorus]
When I stop dreaming
That's when I'll stop thinking of you

[Verse 3]
You may teach the flowers to bloom in the snow
You may take a pebble and teach it to grow
You may teach all the raindrops to return to the clouds
But you can't teach my heart to forget

[Chorus]
When I stop dreaming
That's when I'll stop crying for you"
The Louvin Brothers,Katie Dear,"[Verse 1]
Oh Katie dear go ask your mother
If you can be a bride of mine
If she says yes come back and tell me
If she says no we'll run away
Oh Willie dear there's no use in asking
She's in her room a-takin’ rest
And by her side is a silver dagger
To slay the one that I love best

[Verse 2]
Oh Katie dear go ask your father
If you can be a bride of mine
If he says yes, come back and tell me
If he says no, we'll run away
Oh Willie dear, there's no use in asking
He’s in his room a-takin’ rest
And by his side there's a golden dagger
To slay the one that I love best

[Verse 3]
Then he picked up this golden dagger
And stove it through his troubled heart
Saying ""Goodbye, Katie goodbye darlin'
At last the time has come to part""
Then she picked up that bloody dagger
And stove it through her lily-white breast
Saying ""Goodbye papa, goodbye mama
I'll die with the one that I love best"""
The Louvin Brothers,The Angels Rejoiced Last Night,"A house not a home was the picture Satan painted
For sweet little sister and me
Our daddy would frown while mother was prayin'
His heart was so hardened that he would not believe
In anger he'd swear his voice low and loud
His Sundays were spent out with the gamblin' crowd
I've never seen my daddy inside the house of God
For Satan held his hand, down the path of sin he trod

Not long ago our circle was broken
When God called on Mother one night
In a voice sweet and low her last words were spoken
Asking our daddy to raise her children right

The angels rejoiced in Heaven last night
I heard my daddy pray ""Dear God, make it right""
He was smiling and singing with tears in his eyes
While Mother with the angels rejoiced last night
While Mother with the angels rejoiced last night"
The Louvin Brothers,The River Of Jordan,"To the River Of Jordan our Savior went one day
And we read that John The Baptist met Him there
And when John baptized Jesus in Jordan's rushing waters
The mighty power of God filled the air
I'm on my way to the River Of Jordan
Gonna wade right in to the rushing waters
I'm going down to the River Of Jordan
And let the cool waters cleanse my soul

King Naaman was stricken with dreaded leprosy
And he sent for the man of God to pray
But Elisha said to Naaman ""go dip yourself in Jordan""
And let the cool waters wash your spots away

So he went right down to the River Of Jordan
He waded right in the rushing waters
He dipped himself in the River Of Jordan
And the cool waters made him whole

Oh the River Of Jordan is many miles away
And this mighty river I may never see
But I'll find myself an alter in an old fashioned church
And my River Of Jordan that will be"
The Louvin Brothers,Kentucky,"[Verse 1]
Kentucky, you are the dearest land outside of Heaven to me
Kentucky, your laurels and your redbud trees
When I die, I want to rest upon your graceful mountain so high
Kentucky, that is where God will look for me

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Kentucky, I miss the voices singing in the silvery moonlight
Kentucky, I miss the hound dog chasing coon
I know that my mother, dad and sweetheart all are waiting for me
Kentucky, I will be coming soon

[Outro]
Kentucky, I will be coming soon"
The Louvin Brothers,My Baby’s Gone,"[Chorus]
Hold back the rushing minutes, make the wind lie still
Don't let the moonlight shine across the lonely hill
Dry all the raindrops and hold back the sun
My world has ended, my baby's gone

[Verse 1]
The milkman whistles softly as he comes up to my door
The mailman brings the letters by just like he did before
They seem so busy all day long as though there's nothing wrong
Don't they know the world has ended? My baby's gone

[Chorus]
Hold back the rushing minutes, make the wind lie still
Don't let the moonlight shine across the lonely hill
Dry all the raindrops and hold back the sun
My world has ended, my baby's gone

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
I wake up sometimes in the night and realize you're gone
And then I toss upon my bed and wait for day to come
I try to tell my lonely heart it must go on alone
But it cries, ""The world has ended, my baby's gone""

[Chorus]
Hold back the rushing minutes, make the wind lie still
Don't let the moonlight shine across the lonely hill
Dry all the raindrops and hold back the sun
My world has ended, my baby's gone"
The Louvin Brothers,I’ll Be All Smiles Tonight,"[Verse 1]
I'll deck my brow with roses
My true love may be there
And gems that others gave me
Shall shine within my hair
And even them that know me
Will think my heart is light
Though my heart will break tomorrow
I'll be all smiles tonight

[Chorus]
I'll be all smiles tonight, love
I'll be all smiles tonight
Though my heart may break tomorrow
I'll be all smiles tonight

[Verse 2]
And when the room he entered
The bride upon his arm
I stood and gazed upon him
As though he were a charm
And then he smiled upon her
As once he smiled on me
They know not what
I suffered
They found no change in me

[Chorus]
I'll be all smiles tonight, love
I'll be all smiles tonight
Though my heart may break tomorrow
I'll be all smiles tonight

[Verse 3]
And when the dance is over
And all have gone to rest
I'll think of him, dear mother
The one that I love best
He once did love, believe me
But now he's cold and strange
He sought not to deceive me
False friends have brought this change

[Chorus]
I'll be all smiles tonight, love
I'll be all smiles tonight
Though my heart may break tomorrow
I'll be all smiles tonight"
The Louvin Brothers,The Christian Life,"I like the Christian life

My buddies tell me that I should have waited
They say I'm missing a whole world of fun
But I am happy and I sing with pride
I like the Christian life

I won't lose a friend by heeding God's call
For what is a friend who'd want you to fall
Others find pleasures in things I despise
I like the Christian life

My buddies shun me since I turned to Jesus
But I still love them they burden my heart
I'll try to lead them to walk in the light
I like the Christian life

I won't lose a friend by heeding God's call
For what is a friend who'd want you to fall
Others find pleasures in things I despise
I like the Christian life"
The Louvin Brothers,You’re Running Wild,"[Verse]
You’re running wild, how long can this go on?
You’re leaving me alone and running wild
You’re always gone, my love you never share
It’s more than I can bear, you’re running wild

[Chorus]
You’ll settle down someday and find I’ve gone away
You’ll think of what you’ve done while running wild
I can’t go on, you’ll have to choose the way
You’ll have to go or stay, stop running wild

[Chorus]
You’ll settle down someday and find I’ve gone away
You’ll think of what you’ve done while running wild
I can’t go on, you’ll have to choose the way
You’ll have to go or stay, stop running wild

[Outro]
You’re running wild"
The Louvin Brothers,There’s A Higher Power,"When burdens seem to overcome there's a higher power
Who's able and refuses none there's a higher power
Then why ask men to help you through there's a higher power
They're helpless pilgrims just like you there's a higher power

So sing and shout walk and talk there's a higher power
Lay down your soul cause Jesus bought it there's a higher power
Amen amen amen amen there's a higher power
Amen amen amen amen there's a higher power

Oh go tell people lost in sin there's a higher power
They need not fear the works of men there's a higher power
Believe in him to rest on high there's a higher power
Unless they do they'll surely die there's a higher power

Those men have built these mighty guns there's a higher power
They've built these automobiles that run there's a higher power
But brothers and sisters mark this down there's a higher power
They can't build you no heavenly crown there's a higher power"
The Louvin Brothers,The Weapon of Prayer,"In that land across the sea, there's a job for you and me
Though our presence there may not be found
We must stay standing there on the battle line and pray
We must never lay our weapons down

We don't have to be a soldier in a uniform
To be of service over there
While the boys so bravely stand with the weapons made by hand
Let us trust and use the weapon of prayer

Many thousand miles away, someone sheds their blood today
With a heart so true and brave, they've gone
To a war that's yours and mine, let us join the battle line
With a weapon that will save our home

We don't have to be a soldier in a uniform
To be of service over there
While the boys so bravely stand with the weapons made by hand
Let us trust and use the weapon of prayer

When the planes and tanks and guns have done all that they can do
When the mighty bombs have rained and failed
Still the helpful hand above holds the weapon made of love
And against him none on earth prevail

We don't have to be a soldier in a uniform
To be of service over there
While the boys so bravely stand with the weapons made by hand
Let us trust and use the weapon of prayer"
The Louvin Brothers,The Kneeling Drunkard’s Plea,"""Lord, have mercy on me""
Was the kneeling drunkard's plea
And as he knelt there on the ground
I know that God in heaven looked down

I went down by an old country church
I saw the drunkard stagger and lurch
And as he reached his mother's grave
I saw that drunkard kneel and pray

""Lord, have mercy on me""
Was the kneeling drunkard's plea
And as he knelt there on the ground
I know that God in heaven looked down

""Bring my darling boy to me""
Was his mother's dying plea
And as he staggered through the gate
Alas, he came just one day too late

Three years have passed since she went away
Her son is sleeping beside her today
And I know that in heaven, his mother he'll see
For God has heard that drunkard's plea

""Lord, have mercy on me""
Was the kneeling drunkard's plea
And as he knelt there on the ground
I know that God in heaven looked down
I know that God in heaven looked down"
The Louvin Brothers,"Let Her Go, God Bless Her","[Chorus]
Let her go, let her go, God bless her
She's mine everywhere she may be
She may ramble this wide world all over
But she'll never find a friend like me

[Verse 1]
I went to church last Sunday
I saw my old true love there
And I knew her mind was a'changin'
From the way that she done up her hair

[Chorus]
Let her go, let her go, God bless her
She's mine everywhere she may be
She may ramble this wide world all over
But she'll never find a friend like me

[Verse 2]
I'm going to the races
To see my pony run
And if I win any green back
We're sure gonna have some fun

[Chorus]
Let her go, let her go, God bless her
She's mine everywhere she may be
She may ramble this wide world all over
But she'll never find a friend like me

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I live in the country
Sometimes I live in town
But sometimes
I take a good notion
To jump in the river and drown

[Chorus]
Let her go, let her go, God bless her
She's mine everywhere she may be
She may ramble this wide world all over
But she'll never find a friend like me"
The Louvin Brothers,He Can Be Found,"He can be found in a mother's smile
He can be found in the eyes of a child
He can be found He is everywhere
When we kneel in prayer each plea He hears

He can be found in the air that we breath
He'll always hear a heart that grieves
He can be found on life's stormy seas
He can be found in you and me

He can be found in the hearts of great men
He will reach down for one who has sinned
The peasant's daughter or the rich man's son
All who believe and who will let Him come"
The Louvin Brothers,Satan’s Jeweled Crown,"[Chorus]
Satan's jeweled crown I've worn it so long
But God for my soul has reached down
His love set me free, He made me his own
And helped me cast off Satan's jeweled crown

[Verse 1]
If I could be king and ruler of nations
While jewels and diamonds profound
I'd rather know that I had salvation
Then to know my reward was Satan's jewel crown

[Chorus]
Satan's jeweled crown I've worn it so long
But God for my soul has reached down
His love set me free, He made me his own
And helped me cast off Satan's jeweled crown

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
When I live my life so reckless and evil
Drinking and running around
The things I would do were the will of the devil
I was giving my soul for Satan's jeweled crown

[Chorus]
Satan's jeweled crown I've worn it so long
But God for my soul has reached down
His love set me free, He made me his own
And helped me cast off Satan's jeweled crown"
The Louvin Brothers,Are You Afraid to Die,"Are you a stranger to God?
Carried away with your pride
Tell me, sinner, did you ever step to think?
Are you afraid to die?

Are you afraid?
Are you unsaved?
Are you afraid to die?

Call on Him while He's near
Moments are swift passing by
Will you seek Him where He may be found?
Are you afraid to die?

Are you too wicked to cry?
Would you to God's bosom fly?
Soon He's coming, like a thief in the night
Are you afraid to die?"
The Louvin Brothers,Mary Of The Wild Moor,"It was on one cold winter night
When the wind blew across the wild moor
When Mary came wandering home with her child
'Til she came to her own father's door

Father, dear father, she cried
Come down and open the door
Or the child in my arms, will perish and die
From the winds that blow across the wild moor

""Oh, why did I leave this fair spot
Where once I was happy and free
I'm now doomed to roam without friends or a home
And no one to take pity on me""

But her father was deaf to her cry
Not a sound of her voice, did he hear
So the watch dog did howl and the village bells tolled
And the wind blew across the wild moor

Oh, how the old man must have felt
When he came to the door, the next mornin'
And he found Mary dead, but the child still alive
Closely grasping his dead mother's arms

In anguish he tore his gray hair
While the tears down his cheeks they did pour
When he saw how that night she had perished and died
From the winds that blew across the wild moor

In grief the old man pined away
And the child to it's mother went soon
And no one they say, lives there to this day
And the cottage to ruin has gone

But the villagers point out the spot
Where the willows grew over the door
Saying there Mary died, once the gay village bride
From the wind that blow across the wild moor"

Roger Miller,Oo-De-Lally,"Robin Hood and Little John, walking through the forest
Laughing back and forth at what the other’n has to say
Reminiscing this and that and having such a good time
Oo-de-lally, oo-de-lally, golly, what a day

Never ever thinking there was danger in the water
They were drinking, they just guzzled it down
Never dreaming that a scheming sheriff and his posse
Was a-watching them and gathering around

Robin Hood and Little John, running through the forest
Jumping fences, dodging trees and trying to get away
Contemplating nothing but escape and finally making it
Oo-de-lally, oo-de-lally, golly, what a day

Oo-de-lally, oo-de-lally, golly, what a day"
Roger Miller,Chug-a-Lug,"Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug

Grape wine in a Mason jar
Homemade and brought to school
By a friend of mine 'n' after class
Me and him and this other fool decide
That we'll drink up what's left
Chug-a-lug, so help thyself
First time for everything
Mmm, my ears still ring

4-H and FFA
On a field trip to the farm
Me 'n' a friend sneak off behind
This big old barn where we uncovered
A covered-up moonshine still
And we thought we'd drink our fill
And I swallered it with a smile
Bll-bbb, I run ten mile

Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug
Make you want to holler hi-de-ho
Burns your tummy, don'tcha know?
Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug

Jukebox 'n' sawdust floor
Sumpin' like I ain't never seen
And I'm just goin' on fifteen
But with the help of my finaglin' uncle
I get snuck in
For my first taste of sin
I said, ""Lemme have a big old sip""
Bll-bbb, I done a double back flip

Roger Miller,Dang Me,"Well, here I sit high, gettin' ideas
Ain't nothin' but a fool could live like this
Out all night and runnin' wild
Woman's sittin' home with a month old child

Dang me, dang me
They oughta take a rope and hang me
High from the highest tree
Woman, would you weep for me?

Just sittin' 'round drinkin' with the rest of the guys
Six rounds bought, and I bought five
And I spent the groceries, and a half the rent
I lack fourteen dollars and a-twenty seven cents

Dang me, dang me
They oughta take a rope and hang me
High from the highest tree
Woman, would you weep for me?

Roses are red and violets are purple
Ssugar's sweet and so is maple surple
Well I'm seventh out of seven sons
My pappy's a pistol, I'm a son of a gun

Well, dang me, dang me
They oughta take a rope and hang me
High from the highest tree
Woman, would you weep for me?"

Roger Miller,Not in Nottingham,"Every town has its ups and downs
Sometimes ups outnumber the downs
But not in Nottingham

I'm inclined to believe
If we weren't so down, we'd up and leave
We'd up and fly if we had wings for flying
Can't you see the tears we're crying?
Can't there be some happiness for me?
Not in Nottingham"
Roger Miller,Little Green Apples,"And I wake up in the morning
With my hair down in my eyes and she says, ""Hi""
And I stumble to the breakfast table
While the kids are going off to school, goodbye
And she reaches out takes my hand and squeezes it
And says, ""How you feeling, hon?""
And I look across at smiling lips
That warms my heart and see my morning sun

And if that's not loving me, then all I've got to say
God didn't make the little green apples
It don't rain in Indianapolis in the summer time
And there's no such thing as Dr. Seuss, or Disney Land
And Mother Goose is no nursery rhyme
God didn't make the little green apples
It don't rain in Indianapolis in the summer time

And when myself is feeling low, I think about her face aglow
And ease my mind

Sometimes I call her up at home knowing she's busy
And ask her if she can get away and meet me
And maybe we can grab a bite to eat
And she drops what she's doing and she hurries down to meet me
And I'm always late
But she sits waiting patiently and smiles when she first sees me
'Cause she's made that way

And if that ain't not loving me, then all I've got to say

God didn't make the little green apples
And it don't snow in Indianapolis when the winter comes
And there's no such thing as make believe
Puppy dogs, or autumn leaves, no BB guns

God didn't make the little green apples
It don't rain in Indianapolis in the summer time"
Roger Miller,England Swings,"England swings like a pendulum do
Bobbies on bicycles, two by two
Westminster Abbey, the Tower, and Big Ben
The rosy red cheeks of the little children

Now, if you huff and puff and you finally save enough
Money up to take your family on a trip across the sea
Take a tip before you take your trip; let me tell you where to go
Go to England, oh

England swings like a pendulum do
Bobbies on bicycles, two by two
Westminster Abbey the tower of Big Ben
The rosy red cheeks of the little children

Mama's old pajamas and your papa's mustache
Falling out the window sill, frolic in the grass
Tryin' to mock the way they talk fun but all in vain
Gaping at the dapper men with derby hats and canes

England swings like a pendulum do
Bobbies on Bicycles, two by two
Westminster Abbey the tower of Big Ben
The rosy red cheeks of the little children"
Roger Miller,A World So Full of Love,"I know how it feels to be alive with no desire to live
I know how it feels to die inside and try hard to forgive
And my way of finding out is 'cos a love just let me down
In a world so full of love, yet not enough to go around

I was once so proud to have her love
That I could burst with pride
But that sunshine turned to storm
And now that's all I feel inside
It's enough to make me wish
That I could hide and not be found
In a world so full of love yet not enough to go around

I could sit for days and wonder and not find the answer still
By the time I die I wonder if by then I even will
I must live to be a hundred if I hope to live it down
In a world so full of love yet not enough to go around"

Roger Miller,Husbands and Wives,"[Verse 1]
Two broken hearts lonely, lookin' like
Houses where nobody lives
Two people each havin' so much pride inside
Neither side forgives

[Chorus]
The angry words spoken in haste
Such a waste of two lives
It's my belief pride is the chief cause in the decline
In the number of husbands and wives

[Post-Chorus]
A woman and a man, a man, and a woman
Some can and some can't and some can't

[Verse 2]
Two broken hearts lonely, lookin' like
Houses where nobody lives
Two people each havin' so much pride inside
Neither side forgives

The angry words spoken in haste
Such a waste of two lives

In the number of husbands and wives"
Roger Miller,Kansas City Star,"Got a letter just this morning
It was postmarked Omaha
It was typed and neatly written
Offering me this better job
Better job with higher wages
Expenses paid and a car
But I'm on TV here locally
I can't quit, I'm a star

I come on the TV
Grinnin', wearing pistols and a hat
It's a kiddie show and I'm a hero
Of the younger set
I'm the number one attraction
In every supermarket parking lot
I'm the king of Kansas City
No thanks Omaha, thanks a lot

Kansas City Star
That's what I are
Yoodledy you ought to see my car
I drive a big old Cadillac with wired wheels
I got rhinestones on my spokes
I've got credit down at the grocery store
And my barber tells me jokes

In every supermarket parking lot
I'm the king of Kansas City
No thanks Omaha, thanks a lot

My uncle used to love but she died
A chicken ain't chicken 'til he's lickin' good and fried
Keep on the sunny side
My uncle used to love me but she died

[Verse 1]
Who'll bid me quarter, thirty cents for a ring of keys
Three sixty-five for a dollar bill of groceries?
I'll have me a car of my own someday but 'til then I need me a ride
My uncle used to love me but she died

My uncle used to love but she died
A chicken ain't chicken 'til he's lickin' good and fried
Keep on the sunny side

Hamburger, cup of coffee, lettuce and tomato
Two times a dime to see a man kiss the alligator
One more time around free on the Ferris wheel ride

A chicken ain't chicken 'til he's lickin' good and fried
Keep on the sunny side

I've heard about a-huggin', and I've heard about kissin'
I read about it free in a fifty-cent illustrated guide

Roger Miller,River in the Rain,"[Huck]
River in the rain
Sometimes at night you look like a long, white train
Winding your way away somewhere
River, I love you, don't you care?

If you're on the run
Winding some place just tryin' to find the sun
Whether the sunshine, whether the rain
River, I love you just the same

[Jim]
But sometimes in a time of trouble
When you're out of hand and your muddy bubbles
Roll across my floor
Carryin' away the things I treasure
Hell, there ain't no way to measure
Why I love you more than I did the day before

[Huck and Jim]
River in the rain
Sometimes at night, you look like a long, white train
Winding your way away somewhere
River, I love you, don't you care?

[Jim]
But sometimes in a time of trouble
When you're out of hand and your muddy bubbles
Roll across the floor, hey

[Huck and Jim]
Carryin' away the things I treasure
Hell, there ain't no way to measure
Why I love you more than I did the day before

River in the rain
Sometimes at night, you look like a long, white train
Winding your way away from me
River, I've never seen the sea"
Roger Miller,Whistle Stop,
Roger Miller,The Ballad Of Waterhole #3 (Code Of The West),"I'll tell you a story that's never been told
Of rapin' and killin'
And government gold
The place Arizona
The year '84
Sit back and I'll tell you some more

A thirty year captain
Just earnin' his pay
Was movin' a shipment of bullion that day
While men without honor were waitin' to test
The unwritten code of the west

It's the code of the west
You must honor your neighbor
The code of the west
To your own self be true
The code of the west
You must do unto others
Do unto others before they do it unto you

Sweet yellow, sweet yellow
Sweet tangerine gold
You make a man fevered you make a man bold

So the town of Delores that morning in May
Was in for an infamous day

You don't draw with the stranger
If he's faster than you
You've sung your last ditty
You've kissed your last pretty
And played yer last hand if you do

When fate is the dealer you raise or you call
A chance takin' man plays the cards as they fall
A map worth a killin' is worth trackin' down
So off to Integrity town
The code of the west ain't some words on a page
You just naturally know it when you come of age
You eat when you're hungry, you drink when you're dry
You look every man in the eye

It's the code of the west when the boys talk of women
The code of the west what you know you don't tell
The code of the west a man soaps his own saddle
Brands his own cattle and some of his neighbour's as well

If you're buildin' fences then I ain't for hire
You get me for nothin' and I'll bring the wire
You patch up my windows, I'll plumb up your doors
If you scratch my back I'll scratch yours

It's the code of the west you must honour your neighbour
The code of the west to your own self be true
The code of the west you must do unto others
Do unto others before them others do it unto you

A yellow haired woman is early to bloom
Her laughter is roses
Her smile is perfume
But the child of the lawman can die on the vine
With no man to take of her wine

It's the code of the west
You don't leave for tomorrow
The code of the west
What can be done today
The code of the west
It's a true fact of livin'
What so lovingly given will lovingly come back yer way

The desert was losing its fight with the sun
As Cole stopped for water at hole number 1
Just what was he chasin' he'd sure like to know
But he still had him two holes to go

The code of the west
Show your backside to evil
The code of the west
Give the devil his due
The code of the west
You must do unto others
Do unto others before they do it unto you

Now rapin' and killin'
Ain't really so bad
But stealin' ole Blue
Now that made sheriff John mad
You don't help yourself to the eggs in the nest
Of the man with the badge on his vest

For tumbleweeds tumblin' from boulder to stone
Your permanent address is places unknown
You eat when your hungry
You drink when your dry
If wishes were eagles you'd fly

Rest your head on your saddle
Dream of fortune and fame
When the winds in the willow
A girl hugs her pillow
And wishes that she knew his name

Now treat a girl tender
She'll preen like a bride
But take her for granted
She'll come for your hide

She'll shoot off your head
If you leave her behind
And you'll loose your natural mind

Sweet yellow, sweet yellow, sweet tangerine gold
You make a man fevered you make a man bold
Your warm like a woman a treasure to hold
Sweet yellow sweet tangerine gold
You make a man fevered you make a man bold
Sweet yellow sweet tangerine gold

You got to do unto others
Do unto others before they do unto you

When a showdown is comin'
When a shootout is due
Face up to the danger
Throw a slug into a stranger
Before he throws one into you
You gotta do unto others
Do unto others before they do unto you

While Ben was playin' steal the gold and make your gettaway
The other three played shoot em up and turnabouts fair play
But Ben had tasted painted lips and heard the sirns song
So he could hardly keep from going wrong
It's the code of the west
Heed the word of your sisters
The code of the west
Make a left turn from sin
The code of the west
Keep an eye on temptation, recite the quotation
That says when Satan calls your name it doesn't matter
How you played the game 'cause all he cares about is
Did you win?

Now Cole and John and Henry J were feelin' mighty sad
To think a little sack of gold could turn a good man bad
But when you picked em meek and mild against the brave and bold
The meek inherit all the armys gold
Now in the meantime Billie girl was scemeing on her own
She know a healthy sweet young thing could live by bread alone
To play the tricky game of life a woman needs a plan
To play the game of love she needs a man

Now Lewton Cole know Billie had some mighty fetchin' ways
Ol' Ben would tell her everything and still get ninety days
Beneath the rock beside the trail that leads to Mexico
You'll find yourself a hundred pounds or so

It's the code of the west
Every girl needs a dowery
The code of the west
And it don't matter whose
The code of the west
When a girls pushin' twenty
She's gotta end up with plenty
If she wants to end up with rice in her shoes

Well Cole had a few other things left to do
He flowered his Stetson
And boarded ol Blue

The rougher you treat em
The stronger they grieve
And the longer they watch when you leave

Oh Mexico is just ahead so gambler move along

There ain't nobody there to care if you did right or wrong
You shot a thief ,you found some gold you stole a kiss or two
And the worlds a better place because of you

Oh the code of the west
When you're drinkin' toquilla
The code of the west
Toast the red white and blue
The code of the west
Be kind to your neighbors
Your new northern neighbors
Remember they've been awfully good to you!!"
Roger Miller,Engine Engine #9,"Engine, Engine No. 9, coming down the railroad line
How much farther back did she get off?
Old brown suitcase that she carried, I've looked for it everywhere
It just ain't here among the rest and I'm a little upset

Yes, tell me Engine, Engine No. 9, coming down the railroad line
I know she got on in Baltimore
A hundred and ten miles ain't much distance, but
It sure do make a difference, I don't think she loves me anymore
I warned her of the dangers, don't speak to strangers
If by chance she find new romance, warmer lips to kiss her
Arms to hold her tighter, stirring new fires inside her
How I wish that it was me instead of he that stands beside her
Engine, Engine No. 9, coming down the railroad line
I know she got on in Baltimore
A hundred and ten miles ain't much distance
But it sure do make a difference, I don't think she loves me anymore

No, I don't think she loves me anymore

Roger Miller,Where Have All The Average People Gone,"The people in this city call me country
Because of how I walk and talk and smile
Well, I don't mind them laughing in the city
But the country folks all say I'm citified
The fighting men they say that I'm a coward
Because I never push no one around
Gentle people call me trouble maker
'Cause I'll always fight and stand my ground

Funny I don't fit
Where have all the average people gone?
Some pious people point and call me sinner
Because to them I've never seen the lights
Other folks think of me as a preacher
I'm just doing what I think is right
The wealthy people think that I am a hobo
Lean and hungry, writing mournful songs
And the poor, poor people think I am a rich man
But really, I'm just trying to get along

It's funny I don't fit
Tell me where have all the average people gone?

And the government has given me a number
To simplify my birth and life and death
And still my woman thinks I'm awful important
Like the moon and the sun and the sea and the sky and breath

Yes, it's funny I don't fit
Where have all the average people gone?
Funny I don't fit

Roger Miller,The Moon Is High (And So Am I),"Well, the moon is high and so am I
The stars are out and so will I be pretty soon
And I can tell you're mad at me
There you stand tellin' me goodbye
And I say ""no, you can't, go
I love you so much I can't let you get away""
But come the dawn and it will dawn on me you're gone

Uh huh huh, love don't leave me
Don't leave me laying here
This ground is cold and chilly, really
Don't leave your charming Billy way out here, you hear?
Well, the moon is high and so am I
The stars are out and so will I be pretty soon
But come the dawn and it will dawn on me you're gone
Well, the moon is high and so am I..."
Roger Miller,Me and Bobby McGee,"[Verse 1]
Busted flat in Baton Rouge, headin' for the trains
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained
Took us all the way to New Orleans
I took my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana and was
Blowin' sad while Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time and Bobby clappin' hands we fin-
-ally sang up every song that driver knew

[Chorus]
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
Feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee

[Verse 2]
From the coal mines of Kentucky to the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Standin' right beside me, Lord, through everything I done
And every night she kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord, I let her slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope she'll find
And I'd trade all my tomorrows for a single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine

[Chorus]
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all she left for me
I bet feelin' good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
Buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee

[Outro]
La da la la la, la da la la la da la
La da da la la la Bobby McGee
La da la la la, la da la la la da la
La da da la la me and Bobby McGee
La da la la la, la da la la la da la
La da da la me and Bobby McGee (Hey, ho!)
La da la la la, la da la la la da la
La da da la me and Bobby McGee
La da la la la, la da la la la da la
La da da la me and Bobby McGee
La da la la la, la da la la la da la
La da da la me and Bobby McGee (Ha, ho, hey, ho!)
La da la la la, la da la la la da la
La da da la me and Bobby McGee
La da la la la, la da la la la da la

Roger Miller,Reincarnation,"If l was a bird and you was a fish, what would we do?
I guess we'd wish for
Reincarnation, reincarnation
Wouldn't it be a sensation to come back to life reincarnation?

If l was a tree and you was a flower, what would we do?
I guess we'd wait for the power of
Reincarnation, reincarnation
Wouldn't it be a sensation to come back to life from reincarnation?

I love you and don't you know I always will
You're a girl, I'm a boy
But suppose you were a rose
And I was a whip-poor-will

If I was a bird and you was a fish, what would we do?
I guess we'd wish for
Reincarnation, reincarnation
Wouldn't it be a sensation to come back to life from reincarnation?

I love you and don't you know I always will
You're a girl, I'm a boy
But suppose you was a rose
And I was a Whippoorwill

If I was a bird and you was a fish, what would we do?
I guess we'd wish for
Reincarnation, reincarnation
Wouldn't it be a sensation to come back to life from reincarnation?"
Roger Miller,(The Day I Jumped) From Uncle Harvey’s Plane,"Me 'n' Oliver 'n' Virgil was in the drugstore killing time
When my eyes fell upon this magazine
And I got to reading this article on sky-diving and parachuting
And it said jumping out of air-planes was the thing

Now being raised down on a farm and always ready for adventure
I knew that I could figure out a way
I said ""Well Delmer Gill's got a parachute and Uncle Harvey's got an air-plane""
So I said ""Call the boys together, today's the day""

Well I found out too late what Uncle Harvey called an air-plane
Was nothing but an engine and a wing
And I could feel my fear a-rising as Delmer packed the parachute
'Cos he kept telling me I was doing the right thing

Ron Mcloughlin shook my hand as jd strapped me in the harness
And Tildon brought a jug and passed it around
I took one look at that parachute and that whisky and that air-plane
And I turned that bottle up and drank it down

Well I was drunker'n Cooter Jones when they poured me in the plane
The engine coughed and headed for the clouds
But I was sober as a judge by the time they opened up the door
And I've never known my heart to beat so loud

I said, ""Harvey, I can't do it"" as he kicked me out the door
And I wrapped my hands around the landing gear
And I was holding on real good 'til Harvey stepped down on my fingers
And Virgil said he heard me scream from way down there

Well I thanked God and Delmer Gill when my parachute finally opened
I said ""Well, hell there ain't no use in being afraid""
And I went crashing through the hen house, scattering chickens and breaking eggs
And I kissed the ground and fainted dead away

Now friends I've done some fighting, and I've been shot at once or twice
And I've durn near been run over by a train
But I don't think I remember being any more afraid
Than the day I jumped from Uncle Harvey's plane"
Roger Miller,I Get Up Early In the Morning,"When Christopher Columbus returned to Spain
The wise men asked him would you please explain
How'd you know the world was round he said I used my brain
And I get up early in the morning

Well get up and get up when the sun comes up
Don't lay there dozin' like a lazy pup
Health and wealth will overflow your cup
If you get up early in the morning

Andrew Jackson fought the British down in New Orleans
And he sent them runnin' through the turnip greens
When they wondered how he did it he said were just mean
And I get up early in the morning

They asked Casanova uh man what you got
That makes all the women think that you're so hot
He said well my little secret boys believe it or not
Is I get up early in the morning"
Roger Miller,Hand For The Hog,"[Tom Sawyer]
Well I always heard, but I ain't too sure
That a man's best friend is a mangey cur
I kinda favor the hog myself
How 'bout a hand for the hog?

Say a hog ain't nothin' but a porky thing
Little fork-ed feet with a nosey ring
Pickle them feet, folks
How 'bout a hand for the hog?

If you took the notion, I bet
A good hog would make a helluva pet
You could teach him to ride and hunt
You could clean him up and let him sit up front

Di-di-de, di-di-de, di-di-de, di-di-de doo

In the scheme of things, the way things go
You might get bit by the old Fido
But not that gentle porker friend
How 'bout a hand for the hog?

Fella and a hog had a comedy act
Fella was terrible, as a matter of fact
That hog was a funny sucker, though
How 'bout a hand for the hog?

If you took the notion, I bet
You could teach a hog to smoke a cigarette
Well it might take a little bit of time
But, hell, what's time to a hog?

The way I see it, it looks like this
Either you ain't or either you is
A true blue lover of the swine, folks
How 'bout a hand for the hog?

Diddle-lit, diddle-lit, diddle-lit, diddle-lit
Do-do-do-do-doo

Thank you!"
Roger Miller,One Dyin’ and a Buryin’,"Well, I think I finally found me a sure-fire way to forget
It's so simple, I'm surprised I hadn't done thought of it before yet
It's foolproof - well, it's foolhardy, maybe, but who knows
Anyway, here I am walking toward where the cold dark water flows
Cos all it takes is:

One dying and a buryin'
One dying and a buryin'
Some crying
Six carrying me
I wanna be free

Oh...I wanna be free
Free from all this heartache and regret
And free from pining for the love I can't forget
The love that once was warm and then just somehow turned to hate
Made my life a prison from which there's only one escape
And that's:

One dying and a buryin'
One dying and a buryin'
Some cryin'
Six carryin' me
I wanna be free

One dying and a buryin'
One dying and a buryin'
Some cryin'
Six carryin' me
I wanna be free"
Jerry Lee Lewis,Great Balls of Fire,"[Verse 1]
You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain
Too much love drives a man insane
You broke my will but what a thrill
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire

[Verse 2]
I laughed at love 'cause I thought it was funny
You came along and you moved me, honey
I've changed my mind, this love is fine
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire

[Chorus]
You kiss me, baby
Woah, it feels good
Hold me, baby
Girl, love you like a lover should
You're fine, so kind
But I'ma tell this world that you're mine, mine, mine, mine

[Verse 3]
I chew my nails and I twiddle my thumbs
I get nervous, but it sure is fun
Come on, baby, you drive me crazy
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire

[Piano Solo]

[Chorus]
Well, kiss me, baby
Woah, it feels good
Hold me, baby
I wanna love you like a lover should
You're fine, so kind
I gotta tell this world that you're mine, mine, mine, mine

[Verse 3]
I chew my nails and I twiddle my thumbs
I'm real nervous, 'cause it sure is fun
Come on, baby, you're driving me crazy
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire

I said goodness gracious, great balls of fire"

And wiggle around just a little bit
And that's when you got something, yeah
Well, you got to shake it for me

[Chorus]
Shake it, baby, shake it
Shake it, baby, shake, ooh

Shake, baby, shake it

Jerry Lee Lewis,"Another Place, Another Time","One by one they're turning out the lights
I've been feedin' that ol' jukebox just to hold you tight
I guess its for the best I just put in my last dime
I heard you whisper ""We'll meet again, another place, another time""

Chairs are stacked all over tables its closing time they say
I could wait right here forever if they'd only let me stay
Anywhere would be much better than lonely room of mine
Through a lonely night a waitin' for another place, another time

Won't that room of mine be a lonely place to be
I've been so used to holding you close to me
Won't that old stairway be hard to climb
To a lonely room waiting for another place, another time

Won't that old stairway be hard to climb
To a lonely room to wait for another place, another time"
Jerry Lee Lewis,Crazy Arms,"Now, blue ain't the word for the way that I feel
An ol' storm's brewing in this heart of mine
Someday crazy arms will hold somebody new
But now I'm so lonely all the time

Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
While yearning heart keeps saying ""you're not mine, not mine, not mine, not mine""
My troubled mind grews blue, to another you'll be wed
But now I'm so lonely all the time

{Piano solo}

Now, take all those precious dreams I had for you and me
And take all the love I thought was mine
Someday your crazy arms will hold somebody new
But now I'm so lonely all the time

Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
While yearning heart keeps saying ""you're not mine, not mine, not mine, not mine""
My troubled mind grews blue, to another you'll be wed
But now I'm so lonely all the time"
Jerry Lee Lewis,The Lily of the Valley,"I have found a friend in Jesus He's everything to me
He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul
The lily of the valley and in Him alone I see
All I need to cleanse and make me fully whole

In sorrow He's my comfort in trouble He's my stay
He tells me every care on Him to roll
He's the lily of the valley He's the bright and morning star
He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul

He all my grief has taken and all my sorrows borne
In temptation He's my strong and mighty tower
I have all for Him forsaken and all my idols torn
From my heart and now I know He'll keep me by His power

Though all the world forsake me and old Satan he tempts me sore
Through Jesus I shall safely reach that goal
He's the lily of the valley He's the bright and morning star
He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul

He will never never leave me nor yet forsake me here
While I live by faith and do His blessed will
It's a wall of fire about me but I've nothing now to fear
With His manna He my hungry soul is gonna fill

Then I'll go sweeping up to Glory to see His blessed face
Where rivers of delight shall ever roll
He's the lily of the valley He's the bright and morning star
He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul"

Jerry Lee Lewis,Middle Age Crazy,"[Verse 1]
Today he traded his big 98 Oldsmobile
He got a heck of a deal
On a new Porsche car
He ain't wearing his usual grey business suit
He's got jeans and high boots
With an embroidered star

[Chorus 1]
An' today he's forty years old going on twenty
Don't look for the grey in his hair
'Cause he ain't got any
He's got a young thing beside him
That just melts in his hand
He's middle aged crazy
Trying to prove he still can

[Verse 2]
He's gotta a woman he's loved for a long, long time at home
Ah but the thrill is all gone
When they cut down the lights
They've got a business that they spent a while coming by
Been a long uphill climb
But now the profits are high

[Chorus 2]
But today he's forty years old going on twenty
And he hears of sordid affairs and he ain't had any
And the young thing beside him
You know she understands
That he's middle aged crazy
Trying to prove he still can"
Jerry Lee Lewis,It’ll Be Me,"Well, if you hear somebody knocking on your door
If you see something crawling across the floor
Baby, it'll be me and I'll be looking for you

If you see a head a-peeping from a crawdad hole
If you see somebody climbing up a telephone pole
Baby, it'll be me and I'll be looking for you

I'm gonna look on the mountain and in the deep blue sea
Gonna search all the forests and look and look in every tree

Well, if you feel something heavy on your fishing hook
If you see a funny face in your comic book
Baby, it'll be me and I'll be looking for you

If you hear a thought calling out in the night
If you see somebody hanging from a lamp post bright
Baby, it'll be me and I'll be looking for you

Well if you see somebody looking in all the cars
If you see a rocket ship on its way to Mars
Baby, it'll be me and I'll be looking for you

Gonna look in the city where the lights are blue
Gonna search the countryside, and all the haystacks, too

We'll, if you see a new face on a totem pole
If you find a lump in your sugar bowl
Baby, it'll be me and I'll be looking for you"
Jerry Lee Lewis,Wild One,"Well, I'm just out of school

Got the message, I'm alive
I'm a wild, I'm wild one
Ooh, yeah I'm a wild one

Jerry Lee Lewis,Down the Road a Piece,"Now if you wanna hear some boogie like I'm gonna play
It's just an old piano and a knockout bass
The drummer man's a cat they call Kickin' McCoy
You know, remember that rubber-legged boy?
Mama's cookin' chicken fried and bacon grease
Come on along boys it's just down the road a piece

Well, there's a place you really get your kicks
It's open every night about twelve to six
Now if you wanna hear some boogie you can get your fill
And shove and sting like an old steam drill
Come on along you can lose your lead
Down the road, down the road, down the road a piece

There's a place you really get your kicks
It's open every night about twelve to six
Now if you wanna hear some boogie you can get your fill
And shove and sting like an old steam drill
Come on along you can lose your lead
Down the road, down the road, down the road a piece"
Jerry Lee Lewis,Breathless,"Hey girl, if you're gonna love me, honey, please don't tease
If I can hold you, baby, let me squeeze
With my heart going round and round
And my love comes a-tumblin' down

You, you leave me (aaah)
Breathless-ah!

Come on and shake all over, I think you know why
They call it love, it couldn't be no lie
Cause when you call my name, uh, I a-burn like a wooden flame

You, leave me (aah)
It's breathless-ah!

Ooh baby, just a little bit crazy
Honey you're much too much, girl I just can't love you enough
Oh, it's alright to hold me tight, but for you to love me then love me right
Oh come on baby now don't be shy this love was meant for you and I
Wind, rain, sleet or snow, I'm gonna get you baby wherever you go
You, leave me (aah)
Breathless-ah!

(Rock n' roll, brother!)

Well, ooh baby, it's crazy
Honey, you're much too much, thank god girl I can't love you enough
It's alright to hold me tight, but for you to love me then love me right

C'mon baby, don't be shy, this love was meant for you and I
A-wind, rain, sleet or snow, honey's gonna get you wherever you go
You, you leave me (aaah)
Breathless-ah!"
Jerry Lee Lewis,Old Black Joe,"Gone are the days when my heart was young and gay
Gone are the toils of the cotton fields away
Gone to the fields of a better land I know
I hear those gentle voices calling, ""Old Black Joe""

I'm coming, I'm coming
For my head is bending low
I hear those gentle voices calling, ""Old Black Joe""

I'm coming home (I'm coming home)
I'm coming home (I'm coming home)
Oh-oh my head is bending low
I hear those gentle voices calling, ""Old Black Joe""
Old Black Joe, Old Black Joe, Old Black Joe

Why do I weep when my heart should feel no pain?
Why do I sigh that my friends come not again?
Grieving for forms now departed long ago
I hear their gentle voice calling, ""Old Black Joe""

Where are the hearts once so happy and free?
The children so dear that I held upon my knee?
Gone to the shore where my soul has long'd to go
I hear their gentle voice calling, ""Old Black Joe"""
Jerry Lee Lewis,Too Much to Gain to Lose,"Too many miles behind me
Too many trials are through
Too many tears help me to remember
There's too much to gain to lose

Too many sunsets that lie behind the mountains
Too many rivers my feet have walked through
Too many treasures awaiting over yonder
And there's too much to gain to lose

I crossed the hot burning desert
Just struggling the right road to choose
Somewhere up ahead there's cool clear water
And defeat is one word I never use

Too many sunsets that lie behind the mountains
Too many rivers my feet have walked through
Too many treasures awaiting over yonder
And there's too much to gain to lose

And there's too much to gain to lose"
Jerry Lee Lewis,Thirty-Nine and Holding,"[Verse 1]
He's out there somewhere every night
Where the music's playing loud
Doing all the fifties steps
In a 1980 crowd
The dim lights hide his mileage lines
The Clairol hides the gray
And he won't mention anything
That gives his age away

[Chorus]
Lord, he's thirty-nine and holdin'
Holding everything he can
From seventeen to twenty-five
To prove he's still a man
He's holding to a candle
And it's burning at both ends
He's thirty-nine and holding
Holding everything he can

[Verse 2]
You can bet he'll never see
Thirty-nine, again
He should have turned loose long ago
But still-a he's a-hangin' it in
He still thinks that he's the man
That he used to be
He's thirty-nine and holding
And acting twenty-three

[Chorus]
Lord, he's thirty-nine and holdin'
Holdin' everything he can
From seventeen to twenty-five
To prove he's still a man
He's holding to a candle
My God, it's burning at both ends!
He's thirty-nine and holding
Holding everything he can"
Jerry Lee Lewis,Hadacol Boogie,"Down in Lou-'si-an'er in the bright sunshine
They do a little boogie-woogie all the time;
They do...

The Hadacol Boogie (Hadacol Boogie)
The Hadacol Boogie (Hadacol Boogie)
The Hadacol Boogie
Makes you boogie-woogie all the time

A-standin' on the corner with my bottle in my hand
And up steps a mama, said, my Hadacol man;
She done...

The Hadacol Boogie (Hadacol Boogie)
The Hadacol Boogie (Hadacol Boogie)
The Hadacol Boogie
Makes you boogie-woogie all the time

I went down to the farm to rest about a week
But the farmer's wife, she got to walkin' in her sleep;
She done...

The Hadacol Boogie (Hadacol Boogie)
The Hadacol Boogie (Hadacol Boogie)
The Hadacol Boogie
Makes you boogie-woogie all the time

If your radiator leaks and your motor stands still
Give 'er Hadacol and watch 'er boogie up the hill;
She'll do...

The Hadacol Boogie (Hadacol Boogie)
The Hadacol Boogie (Hadacol Boogie)
The Hadacol Boogie
Makes you boogie-woogie all the time

The rooster and the hen, they were standin' in the shade
The rooster done the boogie, while the hen laid the egg;
He done...

The Hadacol Boogie (Hadacol Boogie)
The Hadacol Boogie (Hadacol Boogie)
The Hadacol Boogie
Makes you boogie-woogie all the time

The other little chickens, they gathered around
They done the boogie-woogie, til the sun went down;
They done-

The Hadacol Boogie (Hadacol Boogie)
The Hadacol Boogie (Hadacol Boogie)
The Hadacol Boogie
Makes you boogie-woogie all the time"
Jerry Lee Lewis,You Win Again,"The news is out all over town
That you've been seen out runnin' around
I know that I should leave, but then
I just can't go
You win again

This heart of mine could never see
What everybody knows but me
Just trustin' you was my great sin
What can I do?
You win again

Yes this heart of mine could never see
What everybody knows but me
Just trustin' you was my great sin
What can I do?
You win again"
Jerry Lee Lewis,Pink Cadillac,"You may think I'm foolish for the foolish things I do
You may wonder how come I love you when you get on my nerves like you do
Well, baby, you know you bug me, ain't no secret 'bout that
Well, come on over here and hug me, baby, I'll show you where it's at
Well, honey, it ain't your money, baby, I got plenty of that
I love you for your pink Cadillac, crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back, oozing down the street
Waving to the girls, feeling out of sight
Spending all my money on a Saturday night
Honey, I just wonder what you do there in the back of your pink Cadillac
Pink Cadillac

Way back in the Bible, temptation always comes along
There's always somebody tempting somebody into doing something they know is wrong
Well, they tempt you, man, with silver, and they tempt you, sir, with gold
And they tempt you with the pleasures the flesh does surely hold
They say Eve tempted Adam with an apple but, man, I ain't going for that
I'm going for the pink Cadillac, crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back, oozing down the street
Waving to the girls, feeling out of sight
Spending all my money on a Saturday night
Honey, I just wonder what it feels like in the back of your pink Cadillac
Pink Cadillac

Yeah, some folks say it's a little too big and uses too much gas
Some folks say it's too old, it goes just a little too fast
But my love is bigger than a Honda, it's bigger than a Subaru
Hey man, there's only one thing and there's one car that will do
Anyway we don't have to drive it, we can park it out in back
Have a party in your pink Cadillac, crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back, oozing down the street
Waving to the girls, feeling out of sight
Spending all my money on a Saturday night
Honey I just wonder what it feels like in the back of your pink Cadillac
Pink Cadillac"
Jerry Lee Lewis,Mean Old Man,"If I look like a mean old man that’s what I am
If I look like a mean old man that’s what I am
If I look like a mean old man who’d get you any way he can
Break your heart and kiss your hand
If I look like a mean old man that’s what I am

If I look like a good old friend that’s what I am
If I look like a good old friend that’s what I am
If I look like a good old friend who’s really bending with the wind
And be your friend right to the end that’s what I am

If I look like a voodoo doll that’s what I am
If I look like a voodoo doll that’s what I am
If I look like a voodoo doll who takes his licking standing tall
Who’d rather fight you back than crawl that’s what I am

If I look like an Uncle Bob that’s what I am
If I look like an Uncle Bob that’s what I am
If I look like an Uncle Bob like to slap me on the back and rock you
While he can still do the job that’s what I am

If I look like a voodoo doll that’s what I am
If I look like a voodoo doll that’s what I am
If I look like a voodoo doll who takes his licking standing tall
Who’d rather fight you back than crawl that’s what I am"
Jerry Lee Lewis,She Even Woke Me Up to Say Goodbye,"Morning's come and, Lord, my mind is aching, yes it is
Sunshine standing quietly at my door
Just like the dawn, my heart is silently breaking
With my tears it goes tumbling to the floor

Once again the whole town will be talking, yes they will
Lord, I've seen the pity that's in their eyes
They could never understand
It's her sorrow, it's not a man
And no matter what they say, we know she tried

Baby's packed her soft things and she's left me, she's left me, she's left me
And I know she didn't mean to make me cry
It's not her heart, Lord, it's her mind
She didn't mean to be unkind
Why she even woke me up to say goodbye

It's not her heart, Lord, it's her mind
She didn't mean to be unkind
Why she even woke me up to say goodbye
Goodbye baby"
Jerry Lee Lewis,Hello Josephine,"Hello Josephine. How do you do?
Do you remember me baby like I remember you?
You used to laugh at me and holler ""Woo woo woo""

I used to walk you home
I used to hold your hand
You used to use my umbrella ev'ry time it rained
You used to cry so much it was a crying shame

Hello Josephine. How do you do?
Do you remember me baby like I remember you?
You used to laugh at me and holler 'Woo woo woo""

You used to live over yonder by the railroad track
When it rained you couldn't walk I used to tote you on my back
Now you gotta make believe it was a thrill at that

Hello Josephine. How do you do?
Do you remember me baby like I remember you?
You used to laugh at me and holler 'Woo woo woo"""
Kitty Wells,It Wasn’t God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels,"[Verse 1]
As I sit here tonight the jukebox playing
The tune about the wild side of life
As I listen to the words you are saying
It brings memories when I was a trusting wife

[Chorus]
It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels
As you said in the words of your song
There's many times married men think they're still single
That has caused many a good girl to go wrong

[Verse 2]
It's a shame that all the blame is on us women
It's not true that only you men feel the same
From the start most every heart that's ever broken
Was because there always was a man to blame

[Chorus]
It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels
As you said in the words of your song
There's many times married men think they're still single
That has caused many a good girl to go wrong"
Kitty Wells,How Far Is Heaven,"How far is heaven? Let's go tonight
I want my daddy to hold me tight

A little girl was waiting for her daddy one day
It was time to meet him, when she heard her mommy say
Come to mommy darling, please do not cry
Daddy's gone to heaven, way up in the sky

How far is heaven? When can I go?
To see my daddy, he's there I know
How far is heaven? Let's go tonight
I want my daddy to hold me tight

He was called so suddenly, and could not say goodbye
I know that he's in heaven, we'll meet him by and by
The little girl trembled, her tears she could not hide
She looked up for heaven and then she replied

How far is heaven? When can I go?
To see my daddy, he's there I know
How far is heaven? Let's go tonight
I want my daddy to hold me tight"
Kitty Wells,I’ll Love You ’Till the Day I Die,"Alone here at home while you're free to run and roam
There's no use in tryin' to make my dreams come true
You have always lied to me, my darlin' I can't see
Any reason for my stayin' here alone
I never start our quarrels and I never rush off mad
I'm the one that asks forgiveness, to love you makes me glad
Life isn't worth it's troubles when when you're livin' withregret
Sometimes I wish that we had never met
After all I've been to you seems you'd be just halfway true
That's expectin' too much from a cheat like you
But I know someday you'll care and, my dear, I won't be there
And you'll be the one who sits alone and cries
Alone and so blue and so much in love with you
Why, oh why did God make such a fool as I
Though your love has been untrue I'm still in love with you
And I guess I'll love you till the day I die"
Kitty Wells,Makin’ Believe,"Making believe that you still love me
It's leaving me alone and so blue
But I'll always dream
Still, I'll never own you
Making believe
It's all I can do

Can't hold you close
When you're not with me
You're somebody's love
You'll never be mine
Making believe
I'll spend my lifetime
Loving you
Making believe

Making believe that I never lost you
But my happy hours I find are so few
My plans for the future will never come true
Making believe
What else can I do?

Can't hold you close
When you're not with me
You're somebody's love
You'll never be mine
Making believe
I'll spend my lifetime
Loving you
Making believe"
Kitty Wells,I Dreamed I Searched Heaven for You,"I dreamed I had gone to that city
That city where never comes night
And I thought of right angels in glory
I thought of their mansions of light

I gazed for long long years of rapture
On the face of my saviour so true
And I sang with the servants in holy
Then I dreamed I searched heaven for you

I dreamed I searched heaven for you
Searched vainly true heaven for you
Oh won't you prepare to meet me up there
That's we should search heaven for you

I looked on both sides of the river
That flows through the city of God
I searched through bright mansions celestial
And streets of gold pavement thy trod

The faces of saints by the millions
I scanned in my yearning to see
That face I had cherished so fondly
The face that had grown dear to me

I dreamed I searched heaven for you..."
Kitty Wells,Searching (For Someone Like You),"Searching, I've spent a lifetime, darling
Searching, looking for someone like you
Dreaming, in all my dreams I dream
That someday I'd find someone like you

Other love have come my way but they were not for me
Tell me that you're here to stay, don't ever set me free
'Cause I've been searching, I've spent a lifetime, darling
Searching, looking for someone just like you

Other love have come my way but they were not for me
Tell me that you're here to stay, don't ever set me free
'Cause I've been searching, I've spent a lifetime, darling
Searching, looking for someone just like you"
Kitty Wells,Christmas Ain’t Like Christmas Anymore,"Holidays are lonely days for me no Christmas ain't like Christmas used to be
Since you've gone it's not the same no more no Christmas ain't like Christmas anymore
It once made me happy but now it makes me blue
There's something about Christmas that starts me missing you
No I don't have the spirit as before no Christmas ain't like Christmas anymore

This lonely house don't need no mistletoes for I'm the only one that comes and goes
And since that day you walked out the door well Christmas ain't like Christmas anymore
It once made me happy...
Christmas ain't like Christmas anymore"
Kitty Wells,Amigo’s Guitar,"Tonight they're singing in the villas
Tomorrow you'll be gone so far
Hold me close and say you love me
While Amigo plays his blue guitar

Ay, ay, ay, ay
The moon is lonely
Tomorrow I'll wonder where you are
Ma-na-na morning, my darling
I'll be blue as Amigo's guitar

They've hushed their singing in the villas
All is quiet beneath the stars
Amigo plays Hasta Luego
Upon his lonely blue guitar
Ay, ay, ay, ay
The moon is lonely..."
Kitty Wells,Waltz of the Angels,"The waltz of the angels the moonlight and you
The waltz of the angels I hear each time I hold you tightly in these arms of mine
It's surely from heaven this music I hear
When your lips say I love you in waltz time my dear
There must be a power much higher than I a writer of love songs way up in the sky
The maker of roses of love sweet and true
And the waltz of the angels the moonlight and you

Oh hurry my darling to my waiting arms I'll love you forever and keep you from harm
We know love is endless our hearts have been kissed
By the waltz of the angels and far beyond this
There must be a power much higher than I a writer of love songs way up in the sky
The maker of roses of love sweet and true
And the waltz of the angels he wrote just for you"
Kitty Wells,We Buried Her Beneath the Willows,"One day an angel came down from heaven
An envoy of our God above
From this great world to choose a token
That all his throng in heaven would love

We buried her beneath the willows
With heads bowed low we walked away
God needed her to sing in heaven
We'll meet again on that bright day

A soft song fell within his hearing
He picked our girl her soul her voice
Today our partner sings in heaven
God praised the angel for his choice

We buried her beneath the willows..."
Kitty Wells,Hey Joe,"Hey Joe someone stole your pearly girlie walked off with your jolly dolly
Maybe now you chanced to dance with me
Hey Joe I feel mighty lovey dovey let me be your new for toody
I'll be just as sweet as sweet can be
Now Joe I know just how you feel can't your fickle sweety left before a heel
But if I could be your sweety pie I'll promise you no other guy
Would steal me from you
Hey Joe go put on your dancin' shoes and I'll help you forget your blues
I'll simply got to have you for my own

Hey Joe please don't think I'm nuddy noddy don't think I'm a flirty girly
Cause I let you know I go for you
Hey Joe my poor heart is yearning burning just to hold you tightly nighty
Do I need you yes I guess I do
I love you Joe that's how I feel if I have a chance to prove my love is real
I'll be true to you forever and I swear no one could ever hope to steal me from you
Hey Joe if you want me tell me so my heart is packed and set to go
I want you Joe I need you for my own"
Kitty Wells,I Need The Prayers,"I need the prayers of those I love
While traveling o'er life's rugged way
That I may true and faithful be
And live for Jesus every day

I want my friends to pray for me
To bare my tempted soul above
And intercede with God for me
I need the prayers of those I love

I need the prayers of those I love
To help me in each crying hour
To bare my tempted soul to him
That he may keep me by his pow'r

I want my friends to pray for me..."
Kitty Wells,Dust On The Bible,"Dust on the bible
Dust on the holy word
The words of all the prophets
And the sayings of our Lord

Of all the other books you'll find
There's none salvation holds
Get that dust off the bible
And redeem your poor soul

I went into a home one day
To see some friends of mine
Of all the books and magazines
Not a bible could I find

I asked them for the bible
When they brought it what a shame
For the dust was covered o'er
It not a fingerprint was plain

Dust on the bible...

You can read your magazines
Read of love and tragic things
And not one verse of Christian
Not one verse do you know

When it is the very truth
And its contents good for you
Dust on the bible
Will doom your poor soul

Dust on the bible..."
Kitty Wells,Santa’s On His Way,"Snowflakes're falling Santa's on his way with a lotta jingle bells jingin' on his place
Boys and girls are waitin' clapping out with glee
Cause they know he'll put lots of toys around the Christmas tree
Shanty wants an aeroplane Suzie wants a doll
Bobby wants a pair of skates and Fred a cowboy gun
Santa got his reindeer waitin' and he'll soon be on his way
Oh Santa will bring lots of joy on this Christmas Day

Shanty wants an aeroplane...
Oh Santa will bring lots of joy on this Christmas Day"
Kitty Wells,I Don’t Claim to Be an Angel,"I don't claim to be an angel
My life's been full of sin
But when I met you darling
That all came to an end

Never doubt my love dear
Whatever you may do
I don't claim to be an angel
But my love for you is true

You'll hear talk around town
Of things I used to do
Some will try to poison your mind
That my love can't be true

Many nights I lay awake dear
Hoping our love will last
Wondering if your love is strong enough
To forget about my past

I don't claim to be an angel...

I never knew what real love was
Till you came along
You changed my outlook on life
Made me regret my wrongs

Why should my past keep haunting me
All through the years
I paid for each mistake
With millions of bitter tears

I don't claim to be an angel..."
Kitty Wells,Will Your Lawyer Talk to God,"Your lawyer called and said he had the papers all prepared
To sign my name was all I had to do
He saw the judge now he's seen me, there's only one thing left
Will your lawyer talk to God for you?

Will your lawyer talk to God and plead your case up on high
And defend the way you broke my heart in two?
Man made laws to set you free on Earth, but is God satisfied?
Will your lawyer talk to God for you?

We all face that final judgement, and it's very strict they say
When your time comes, I wonder what you'll do
Will you bow your head in shame, or will you turn your head away?
Or will your lawyer talk to God for you?

Will your lawyer talk to God and plead your case up on high
And defend the way you broke my heart in two?
Man made laws that set you free on Earth, but is God satisfied?
Will your lawyer talk to God for you?"
Kitty Wells,Three Ways (To Love You),"There are three ways three ways three ways to love you it's true
One is the wrong way one is the right way but the best is the way I love you

One is the wrong way like some people do
They're kissin' they're lyin' they'll never be true
But soon they will wonder why love flies away
And though how they'll cry when they'll find out some day
There are three ways...

One is the right way so some people say with dining and dancing in some cabarete
Now some girls may think this is really ideal
But too late they'll find out that love isn't real
There are three ways...

One is the best way the way I love you
With all of my heart and for all my life through
I think of you only forget all the rest I'll show you my darling that my way's the best
There are three ways..."
Kitty Wells,He Will Set Your Fields On Fire,"There's a call that rings for the one
Who sings to those now gone astray
Saying come ye men and your load of sin
There at the altar lay

You don't seem to heed at the chain
Of greed your conscience never tires
Be assured my friend if you still offend
He will set your fields on fire

If you don't from sin retire
He will set your fields on fire
You have heard Jesus call
And in death your soul must fall

Now my friends if you desire
You may join the heavenly choir
And rejoice with him free from every sin
When he sets this world on fire

You have heard his voice
Seen the souls rejoice
That trusted in his grace
You have blushed with sin
And he knocked within
But still you hide your face

From the blessed Lord in his own true word
But still you say retire
Flee the downward path kindle not his wrath
Or he'll set your fields on fire

If you don't from sin retire..."
Kitty Wells,Heartbreak U.S.A.,"(Back home in heartbreak USA)
The harbor's empty, my love has gone
With aching heart I face each cold and lonely dawn
And till the trade winds bring him home to stay
I'll live in heartbreak USA

Don't let those Geisha girls get your heart in a whirl
And if you meet some sweet Fraulein remember you're mine
Don't forget your sweetheart while you're away
Back home in heartbreak USA

Sometimes I'm lonely and time stands still
And I wonder if you feel the way I always will
So darling write me letters every day
In care of heartbreak USA

Don't let those Geisha girls..."
Kitty Wells,There’s Poison In Your Heart,"Once I loved you darling and it thrilled me through and through
I must admit I wanted only you
Your kisses left me restless when you said we'd never part
Your lips are sweet as honey but there's poison in your heart

The way that you two timed is a sin and it's a shame
You even said you'd like to change my name
You vowed that you'll be faithful but you lied right from the start
Your lips are sweet as honey but there's poison in your heart

Maybe I'll find that faded kind can let me love again
Then I'll forget my fickle dreams of you
It's just too bad we've never had an even-steven start
Your lips are sweet as honey but there's poison in your heart"
Kitty Wells,I Don’t Want Your Money (I Want Your Time),"I don't want your money, honey
I just want your time
A kiss that's bought with gifts and gold
Just isn't worth a dime
Don't offer me a string of pearls
Or a penthouse so sublime
I don't want your money, honey
I just want your time
I don't want your money, honey
I just want your time
The two of us, will ride the bus
And up to the moon we'll climb
You can't buy a single kiss
As long as they are mine
'Cause I don't want your money, honey
I just want your time
I don't want your money, honey
I just want your time
Tho' I have a fling won't cost a thing
No worries on our mind
Don't want a great big diamond ring
'Cause I'm just not that kind
I don't want your money, honey
I just want your time"
Kitty Wells,After Dark,"[Verse 1]
After dark you come slipping back to me
From the one who shares your name but scorns your love
While the one who has your name from scandal is free
But the whole world, my darling, looks down on me

[Chorus]
Don't you think I have no pride or shame?
Don't you care that we're the gossip of the town?
Does our love to you just mean a past time lark?
Are you ashamed to be with me till after dark?

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Here of late I can't help but doubt your love
So many things you've promised have turned to lies
You say I'm your love and you're all mine
I'm so tired of double talking your alibis

[Chorus]
Don't you think I have no pride or shame?
Don't you care that we're the gossip of the town?
Does our love to you just mean a past time lark?
Are you ashamed to be with me till after dark?"
Kitty Wells,Release Me,"Please release me
Let me go
I don't love you anymore

To live together is a sin
Release me
And let me love again

I have found a new love dear
And I'll always want him near
His lips are warm
While yours are cold

Release me darling
Let me go

Oh please release me
Let me go..."
Kitty Wells,"Lord, I’m Coming Home","I've wandered far away from God
Now I'm coming home
The path of sin too long I've trod
Lord I'm coming home

Coming home coming home
Never more to roam
Open wide thine arms of love
Lord I'm coming home

I've wasted many precious years
Now I'm coming home
I now repent with bitter tears
Lord I'm coming home

Coming home coming home..."
Kitty Wells,My Loved Ones Are Waiting For Me,"When I shall cross over the dark rolling tide
Oh what a glad meeting there'll be
For close by the beautiful pearly white gate
My loved ones are waiting for me

Waiting for me they're waiting for me
Oh what a glad meeting there'll be
Waiting for me they're waiting for me
My loved ones are waiting for me

I sometimes get weary and long to go home
But all of my work is not done
I'm glad I can labor for Jesus my lord
Till sounds of sweet message come home

Waiting for me they're waiting for me..."
Ray Price,How Big Is God,"[Intro]
God's small enough to live within my heart

[Verse 1]
Though men may strive to go beyond the reach of space
To crawl beyond the distant shining stars
This world's a room so small within my Master's house
The open sky's but a portion of his yard

[Chorus]
How big is God? How big and wide is His vast domain?
To try to tell these lips can only start (Can only start)
He's big enough to rule His mighty universe
Yet small enough to live within my heart

[Verse 2]
As winter chill may cause the tiny seed to fall
To lie asleep 'til waked by summer's rain
The heart grown cold will warm and trod with life anew
The Master's touch will bring the glow again

[Chorus]
How big is God? How big and wide is His vast domain?
To try to tell these lips can only start (Can only start)
He's big enough to rule His mighty universe
Yet small enough to live within my heart

[Outro]
God's small enough to live within my heart"
Ray Price,You’re the Best Thing That Ever Happened to Me,"[Verse 1]
I've had my share of life's ups and downs
But fate's been kind, the downs have been few
I guess you could say that I've been lucky
And I guess you could say, it's all because of you

[Chorus]
If anyone should ever write my life story
For whatever reason there might be
You'd be there between each line of pain and glory
'Cause you're the best thing that ever happened to me
You're the best thing that ever happened to me

[Verse 2]
Lord, there have been times when the times were so hard
But always, somehow, I made it through
But for every moment I've spent hurting
There was a moment spent loving you

[Chorus]
If anyone should ever write my life story
For whatever reason there might be
You'd be there between each line of pain and glory
'Cause you're the best thing that ever happened to me
You're the best thing that ever happened to me"
Ray Price,Heartaches By the Number,"Heartache number one was when you left me
I never knew that I could hurt this way
And heartache number two was when you came back again
You came back and never meant to stay

Now I've got heartaches by the number, troubles by the score
Every day you love me less
Each day I love you more

Yes, I've got heartaches by the number, a love that I can't win
But the day that I'll stop counting
That's the day my world would end

Heartache number three was when you called me
And said that you were coming back to stay
With hopeful heart I waited for your knock on the door
I waited, but you must have lost your way

Now I've got heartaches by the number
And the day that I'll stop counting
That's the day my world will end"
Ray Price,For the Good Times,"[Verse 1]
Don't look so sad, I know it's over
But life goes on and this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges that we're burning

[Chorus]
Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops
Blowing soft against the window
And make-believe you love me one more time
For the good times

[Verse 2]
I'll get along, you'll find another
And I'll be here if you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me

[Chorus]
Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops
Blowing soft against the window
And make-believe you love me one more time
For the good times"
Ray Price,I Wish I Was Eighteen Again,"On a rig down in Venice, an old hand chimed in
And they thought he was out of his head
And all of the young hands, they just laughed it off
When they heard what this old hand had said

He said, ""I'll never again turn the young ladies heads
Or go running off in to the wind
I'm three quarters home from the start to the end
And I wish I was eighteen again""

Oh I wish, I was eighteen again
And going where I've never been
Now old folks and old oaks standing tall just pretend
I wish I was eighteen again

Time turns the pages and life goes so fast
The years turn the black hair all gray
I talk to some young folks but they don't understand
The words this old man got to say

Oh I wish, I was eighteen again
And going where I've never been
Now old folks and old oaks standing tall just pretend
I wish I was eighteen again
Oh I wish I was eighteen again"
Ray Price,City Lights,"A bright array of city lights as far as I can see
The great white way shines through the night for lonely guys like me
The cabaretes and honky tonks their flashing signs invite
A broken heart to lose itself in the glow of city lights
Lights that say forget her name in a glass of cherry wine
Lights that offer other girls for empty hearts like mine
They paint a pretty picture of a world that's gay and bright
But it's just a mask for loneliness behind those city lights

The world was dark and God made stars to brighten up the night
The God who put the stars above I don't believe made those lights
Oh it's just a place for men to cry when things don't turn out right
Just a place to run away and hide behind those city lights
Lights that say forget her love in a different athmosphere
Lights that lure are nothing but a masquarade for tears
They paint a pretty picture but my arms can't hold them tight
And I just can't say I love you to a street of city lights"
Ray Price,Crazy Arms,"[Verse 1]
Now blue ain't the word for the way that I feel
And the storm's brewing in this heart of mine
This ain't no crazy dream I know that it's real
You're someone else's love now you're not mine

[Chorus]
Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
For my yearning heart keeps saying you're not mine
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed
And that's why I'm lonely all the time

[Verse 2]
So please take the treasured dreams I had for you and me
And take all the love I thought was mine
Someday my crazy arms may hold somebody new
But now I'm so lonely all the time

[Chorus]
Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
For my yearning heart keeps saying you're not mine
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed
And that's why I'm lonely all the time"
Ray Price,I Believe,"I believe for every drop of rain that falls
A flower grows
I believe that somewhere in the darkest night
A candle glows
I believe for everyone who goes astray
Someone will come to show the way

I believe I believe

I believe above the storm the smallest prayer
Will still be heard
I believe that someone in the great somewhere
Hears every word

Every time I hear a newborn baby cry
Or touch a leaf or see the sky
Then I know why I believe

Every time I hear a newborn baby cry
Or touch a leaf or see the sky
Then I know why I believe"
Ray Price,Invitation to the Blues,"[Verse 1]
I couldn't sleep last night just walked the floor
Don't know how I stand this anymore
Lonely are the times since I lost you
Received your invitation to the blues

[Chorus]
I don't know why you caused me such pain
I just hope I'll never go through this much again
Thanks for sending something I can't use
Received your invitation to the blues

[Verse 2]
You took the laughter from this world of mine
Thanks to you the sun will never shine
Walk the floor so much wore out my shoes
Received your invitation to the blues

[Chorus]
I don't know why you caused me such pain
I just hope I'll never go through this much again
Lonely me I don't know what to do
Received your invitation to the blues"
Ray Price,Beauty Lies in the Eyes of the Beholder,"Mountain tops rain drops snow flakes when they fall
A babies cry your hazel eyes a night train's lonely call
Starry nights lightning strikes wild horses running free
The world is filled with loveliness
For those who care to see

Beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder
And I hold beauty every time I hold you
With love that only grows as it gets older
And the beauty of it all is forever you'll be holding me too

Fine lines have traced sweet memories
Lightly on your face
And I don't care if every hair's not always right in place
I can see forever when I look into your eyes
And sometimes things that can't be seen is where real beauty lies

Beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder
And I hold beauty every time I hold you
With love that only grows as it gets older
And the beauty of it all is forever you'll be holding me too

And the beauty of it all is that forever you'll be holding me too"
Ray Price,One More Time,"I wonder what the power is that you hold over me
I never get to love you long just your memory
And I make a vow each time you leave that this will draw the line
Then you come back and just like now I'm falling one more time
One more time my lips may kiss you one more time my arms will hold you
But it won't belong until you're gone with a mem'ry left behind
And I just know that when you go I'll be lonely one more time
[ steel ]
Your nearness makes me weaken and I give into you
And I'm doing all the things I said that I wouldn't do
And I make a vow each time you leave that this will draw the line
Then you come back and just like now I'm falling one more time
One more time my lips may kiss you..."
Ray Price,I’ll Be There (If You Ever Want Me),"[Intro]

[Verse 1]
There ain't no chains strong enough to hold me
Ain't no breeze big enough to slow me
Never have I seen a river that's too wide
There ain't no jail tight enough to lock me
Ain't no man big enough to stop me
I'll be there if you ever want me by your side

[Pre-Chorus]
Love me, if you're ever gonna love me
Never have seen a road too rough to ride

[Chorus]
There ain't no chains strong enough to hold me
Ain't no breeze big enough to slow me
I'll be there if you ever want me by your side

[Verse 2]
There ain't no rope strong enough to bind me
Look for me, honey you will find me
Any old time you're ready with your charm
I'll be there, ready and a-waitin'
There won't be any hesitatin'
I'll be here if you ever want me in your arms

[Pre-Chorus]
Love me, if you're ever gonna love me
Never have seen a road too rough to ride

[Chorus]
There ain't no chains strong enough to hold me
Ain't no breeze big enough to slow me
I'll be there if you ever want me by your side"
Ray Price,Burning Memories,"[Intro]
(Burning mem'ries)
(Burning mem'ries memories of you that I can't lose)

[Verse 1]
Tonight I'm burning old love letters
Photographs and memories of you
Hoping somehow I'll feel better
And when the smoke is gone I won't want you

[Chorus]
(Burning mem'ries) Teardrops fall while I am
(Burning mem'ry) Burning all the memories of you that I can't lose

[Verse 2]
My heart to you no longer matters
And I can't live alone with memories
Into the fire those dreams you've shattered
And when the smoke is gone then I'll be free

[Chorus]
(Burning mem'ries) Teardrops fall while I am
(Burning mem'ry) Burning all the memories of you that I can't lose"
Ray Price,Pride,"[Verse 1]
You know that you're doing lots of things that ain't right
You're out with a different party almost every night
And you're making me look like a crazy fool
So, why do I have these doubts about leaving you?

[Chorus]
Because my heart tells me, ""Stay"" but my pride tells me, ""Go""
But how can I leave you when I love you so?
Which way shall I turn? I'd sure like to know
My heart tells me, ""Stay"" but my pride tells me, ""Go""

[Verse 2]
I'd be so much better off to drive you from my mind
And make you a memory that I'd like to leave behind
I know that these heartaches are what you will put me through
So, why do I have these doubts about leaving you?

[Chorus]
Because my heart tells me, ""Stay"" but my pride tells me, ""Go""
So, how can I leave you when I love you so?
Which way shall I turn? I'd sure like to know
My heart tells me, ""Stay"" but my pride tells me, ""Go"""
Ray Price,Night Life,"[Verse 1]
When the evening sun goes down
You will find me hanging round

Oh the night life ain't no good life
But it's my life

[Verse 2]
Many people just like me
Dreaming of old used-to-be

[Refrain]
Oh the night life ain't no good life
But it's my life

Ray Price,Until Then,"(Until the day God calls me home)

My heart can sing when I pause to remember
A heartache here is but a stepping stone
Along a path that's winding always upward
This troubled world is not my final home

But until then my heart will go on singing
Until then with joy I'll carry on
Until the day my eyes behold my Saviour
Until the day God calls me home

[ strings ]

The things of earth will dim and lose their value
If we recall they're borrowed for a while
And things of earth that cause this heart to tremble
Remember there will only bring a smile

But until then my heart will go on singing..."
Ray Price,Don’t You Ever Get Tired of Hurting Me,"You make my eyes run over all the time
You're happy when I'm out of my mind
You don't love me but you won't let me be
Don't you ever get tired of hurtin' me
You must think I look bad with a smile
For you haven't let me wear one in such a long long while
Still I keep running back why must this be
Don't you ever get tired of hurtin' me

Someone must have hurt you along long ago
But why take revenge on one who loves you so
You won't love me and you won't let me be
Don't you ever get tired of hurtin' me
You must think I look bad with a smile
For you haven't let me wear one in such a long long while
Still I keep comming back how can this be
Don't you ever get tired of hurtin' me"
Ray Price,Pick Me Up On Your Way Down,"You were mine for just a while
Now you're putting on the style
And you've never once looked back
At your home across the tracks

You're the gossip of the town
But my heart can still be found
Where you tossed it on the ground
Pick me up on your way down

Pick me up on your way down
When you're blue and all alone
When the glamor starts to bore you
Come on back where you belong

You may be their pride and joy
But they'll find another toy
Then they'll take away your crown
Pick me up on your way down

[Bridge]
They have changed you're attitude
Made you haughty and so rude
Your new friends can take the blame
Underneath you're still the same

When you learn these things are true
I'll be waiting here for you
As you tumble to the ground
Pick me up on your way down

Pick me up on your way down
When you're blue and all alone
When the glamor starts to bore you
Come on back where you belong

You may be their pride and joy
But they'll find another toy
Then they'll take away your crown
Pick me up on your way down"
Ray Price,The Other Woman,"Don't accuse me of being without feelings
If you do, you know that you're wrong
For it was you who was careless
And you drove me into another's arms

The other woman isn't prettier than you
But the other woman soothes my wounded pride
And more important, I feel wanted again
I can't give up the other woman in my life

Now I'm afloat in the middle of a river
And I can't climb out on either side
And if I go over the deep end
It's because, sweetheart, you haven't tried

The other woman isn't prettier than you
But the other woman soothes my wounded pride
And more important, I feel wanted again
I can't give up the other woman in my life"
Ray Price,Release Me,"Please release me, let me go

For I don't love you anymore

To waste our lives would be a sin

Release me and let me love again

I have found a new love din

And I will always want her near

Her lips are warm, while yours are cold

Release me, my darling, let me go

(Please release me, let me go)

For I don't love you anymore

(To waste our life would be a sin)

So release me and let me love again

Please release me, can't you see?

You'd be a fool to cling to me

To live our life would bring us pain

So release me and let me love again

(Let me love, let me go)"
Ray Price,Funny How Time Slips Away,"Well hello there my it's been a long long time
How am I doin' oh I guess that I'm doin' fine
It's been so long now and it seems now that it was yesterday
Oh ain't it funny how time slips away
[ guitar ]
Say how's your new love I hope he's doing fine
I heard you told him that you'd love him till the end of time
Now that's the same thing that you told me it seems like yesterday
Oh ain't it funny how time slips away
[ guitar ]

Ray Price,Time,"Time is a monster... that lives in our clocks 55365...558910
It's heartless and shows no remorse 810910111098
Consuming our future... as we fight 877787665
That hundred year war 56543
Time is a soldier...steady and true
Relentlessly trudging along
And time takes no prisoners
Nothing but time marches on
Time is a weapon...It's cold and it's cruel 1098108...810987
It knows no religion...And plays by no rules 798776...910987
Time has no conscience...When it's all said and done
Like a beast in the jungle...That devours it's young
You can burn up the highway...fly like the wind
Run down those long shiny rails
But time's right behind you... Like a hound dog
That's hot on your trail
But we're all in the same boat
So just hold on...and ride to the end of the line
Time waits for no one...everyone runs out of time"
Ray Price,Hey La La,"Oh, come hear my story, I'll tell it to you
My heart is all broken, I'm sad and I'm blue
I just lost my darling, her name was La La
As pretty as a picture and oh, twice as fair

Hey! La La, Oh! La La, my true La La-aa
Hey! La La, Oh! La La, my true La La

A grave on the hillside all covered with snow
A heart broken lover with head bending low
With tears in his eyes, he placed a red rose
On the grave of his darling up there in the snow

REFRAIN

Oh! God up in heaven, please tell her for me
My hopes are all shattered, oh! say can't you see
Just tell her I'm waiting to meet her up there
I'll look at her picture and send her a prayer"
Ray Price,I Can See You With My Eyes Closed,"I can see your laughing eyes kinda
Lighting up the night around you
I can see the shadows dance around those
Loving moments that we shared
I can see a soft blush cross your face the
Way it did that first time

And I can fee you tremble as I take your hand
And lead you up the stairs
I can see you you with my eyes closed
I can hold you, hold you in my mind
I can see you with my eyes closed
Who said that love is blind?

I can see you standing in my dreams, reaching out to touch me
I can see the silver glow of moonlight halo in your hair
I can hear the silken sound of night gown
Falling down around you and if God would
Only grant the right to turn back time, I'd turn
And find you there

I can see you you with my eyes closed
I can hold you, hold you in my mind
I can see you with my eyes closed
Who said that love is blind?
Who said that love is blind?"
Ray Price,"If You Don’t, Somebody Else Will","If you don't wanna love me, say so baby
Somebody else will
Somebody else will
Somebody else will
If you don't wanna kiss me baby
Somebody else will
Somebody else will kiss me better

Well, I ain't a-gonna beg you for your love anymore
Ever since the first time, I have done learned the score
Well, I thought I had to have you once but that's in the past
Since I'm finally free from you, yes, I'm free at last

If you don't wanna hold me, say so baby

Ronnie Milsap,Smoky Mountain Rain,"[Verse 1]
I thumbed my way
From LA back to Knoxville
I found out those bright lights
Ain't where I belong
From a phone booth in the rain
I called to tell her
I've had a change of dreams
I'm coming home
But tears filled my eyes
When I found out she was gone

[Chorus]
Smoky Mountain rain
Keeps on falling
I keep on calling her name
Smoky Mountain rain
I'll keep on searching
I can't go on hurting this way
She's somewhere in the Smoky Mountain rain

[Verse 2]
I waved a diesel down outside a cafe
He said that he was going
As far as Gatlinburg
I climbed up in the cab
All wet and cold and lonely
I wiped my eyes
And told him about her
I've got to find her
Can you make these big wheels burn?

[Chorus]
Smoky Mountain rain
Keeps on falling
I keep on calling her name
Smoky Mountain rain
I'll keep on searching
I can't go on hurting this way
She's somewhere in the Smoky Mountain rain

[Bridge]
I can't blame her for letting go
A woman needs someone warm to hold
I feel the rain running down my face
I'll find her no matter what it takes

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Smoky Mountain rain
Keeps on falling
I keep on calling her name
Smoky Mountain rain
I'll keep on searching
I can't go on hurting this way
Smoky Mountain rain
Keeps on falling
I keep on calling her name"
Ronnie Milsap,Stranger in My House,"[Verse 1]
There's a silence here between us
I've never heard before
And I can't find the love
In her eyes anymore
There's some changes going on
I'm beginning to understand
When I'm holding her
I swear I feel the presence of another man

[Chorus]
There's a stranger in my house
Somebody here that I can't see
A stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away from me

[Verse 2]
She sits staring out the window
A million miles away
And when I ask if she's alright
She never has too much to say
Is it somebody we both know?
Or somebody she just met?
Is she loving him in her mind
While she's lying here in my bed?

[Chorus]
There's a stranger in my house
Somebody here that I can't see
A stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away from me
(Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo)

[Verse 3]
Suspicions lead to questions
And questions to alibis
Is it just my imagination?
Or has her love turned into lies?

[Chorus]
There's a stranger in my house
Somebody here that I can't see
A stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away
A stranger in my house
Somebody here that I can't see
A stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away
A stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away from me
A stranger in my house"
Ronnie Milsap,Any Day Now,"Any day now
I will hear you say
Good bye, my love
And you'll be on your way
Then my wild beautiful bird, you will have flown
Any day now, I'll be all alone

Any day now
When your restless eyes meets someone new
Oh, to my sad surprise
Then blue shadows will fall all over town
Any day now, love will let me down

I know I shouldn't want to keep you
If you don't want to stay
Until you're gone forever
I'll keep holding on for dear life

Holding you this way
Begging you to stay
Any day now, when the clock strikes go
You'll call it off
Then my tears will flow

Then my wild beautiful bird
You will have flown
Any day now, love will let me down
Cause you won't be around

Oh, then the blue shadows will fall all over town
Any day now
Love will let me down
Cause you won't be around
Any day now
You won't be around
No, no, no, no, no, no, you won't be around"
Ronnie Milsap,Pure Love,"Pure love, baby it's pure love
Milk and honey and Captain Krunch and you in the mornin'

And bluebirds singin' right outside my window
Soft warm kisses

Well, you can say that you need to be free
But there ain't no place that I won't be
Sweet darling, there ain't no getting over me

I'll be the bill you forgot to pay
I'll be the dream that keeps you awake
I'll be the song on the radio
I'll be the reason that you tell the boys no
Don't you know...

You can tell everyone that we're through
And you might even believe it too
But darling, there ain't no getting over me
Sweet darling, there ain't no getting over me

[Instrumental Break]

I'll be the face that you see in the crowd
I'll be the times that you cry out loud
I'll be the smile when there's no one around
I'll be the book that you just can't put down

[Verse 4]
So you can walk out on me tonight
If you think that it ain't feeling right
But darling, there ain't no getting over me
You'll see, sweet darling, there ain't no getting over me

Ronnie Milsap,I’m No Good At Goodbyes,"You don't have to tell me that it's over
For lately I can see it in your eyes
And I'll be gone when you wake up this morning
Cause darling I'm no good at goodbyes
I know we had the good things while it lasted
It's sad to see a good love when it dies
But the teardrops only make it hard for leaving
And darling I'm no good at goodbyes
Although it breaks my heart to write this letter
I know someday that you will realize
That when it hurts so much this way is better
And darling I'm no good at goodbyes
Oh darling I'm no good at goodbyes"

And while my hands make a living my mind's home loving you
I'm having daydreams about night things in the middle of the afternoon
And every night you make my daydreams come true

Well all day long while I'm working in town time slows down to a crawl
When I'm not thinking about you, I'm checking the clock on the wall
Then it's goodbye factory and hello love and there's a smile across my face
'Cause I'm back in the arms of your sweet love
Where my thoughts have been all day

I'm having daydreams about night things in the middle of the afternoon
And while my hands make a living my mind's home loving you
I'm having daydreams about night things in the middle of the afternoon
And every night you make my daydreams come true

Cause you've brought me so much sunshine
And love was the best it's ever been

Ronnie Milsap,Only One Love in My Life,"So many times
These few dreams of mine
Seem hidden behind
A mountain too high to climb
But you were the one
Who said, 'go on, follow your star'

When the song in my heart
Was just a voice in the dark
You could hear my mellow key

There's only one moon
That shines in the night
And only one love in my life

Only one love in my life
Only one love in my life
I'm a ship on the open ocean darling
You're my guiding light

The radio played
My new song today
And I heard someone say
Man, he sure got it made'

If only they knew how much you
Have made of me
Together we came
From nowhere to fame
And I never could have made it
Alone

For me there's only one moon
That shines in the night
And only one love in my life

Only one love in my life
Only one love in my life
I'm a ship on the open ocean
Darling, you're my guiding light!
Yeah!

Only one love in my life
Only one love in my life
I'm a ship on the open ocean
Darling, you're my guiding light!
Yeah!

You're my guiding light
And you're the only love in my life"
Ronnie Milsap,She Keeps the Home Fires Burning,"Crack of dawn, I hit the road
Set my shoulders for the heavy load
Coffee leaking through the paper sack
The foreman says I'm late again
He can't stand it when I only grin
He's got me eight hours, she's got me after that
I can't wait 'til it's quittin' time
She got something cookin' for me tonight

She keeps the homefires burning
While I'm out earning a living in a world
That's known for its pouring rain
She keeps the homefires burning
Ooh, and it's her warm loving
That keeps me returning again and again

Out of gas, just my luck
Four bald tires on my pickup truck
No more credit on my credit card
When I come home and hit that door
I remember what these aching arms are for
She's my one light when the world goes dark
Tomorrow it's the same old grind
But she'll be burning in my mind

She keeps the homefires burning
While I'm out earning a living in a world
That's known for its pouring rain
She keeps the homefires burning
Ooh and it's her warm loving that keeps me returning again

Ooh and it's her warm loving that keeps me returning again

And I don't want to stop to check my weight
There won't be no sleep for me tonight
No, I've got to be hittin' Tulsa by first morning light

I'm a prisoner of the highway
Driven on by my restless soul
Call me a prisoner of the highway
Prison by the freedom of the road

I've run freight out of Wheeling, West Virginia
And US Steel from Bethlehem
I've rode tobacco out of the Carolinas
And California wines into Birmingham
Some people work just to survive, yeah
But up here in this cab that's when I'm most alive

I'm a prisoner of the highway
Driven on by my restless soul
Call me a prisoner of the highway
Prison by the freedom of the road

Got a wife living back in Tennessee
And she tries to understand the way I feel
I could give my hands to another line of work
But my heart would always be behind the wheel

Call me a prisoner of the highway
Driven on by my restless soul
I'm a prisoner of the highway

Driven on by my restless soul

Ronnie Milsap,"Lovers, Friends and Strangers","Looking back into the world we knew
When love was such a sweet surprise
Was it beautiful how strangers came to lovers
Like magic right before our eyes

Strangers become friends and friends become lovers
But the same fire that warms the heart can burn
Then it's lovers, friends, strangers again
Ain't it funny how the circle turns

And looking back I'd do it all again
Although the story's sad but true
Even lovers can be strangers once again
Stranger still I keep on loving you

Strangers become friends and friends become lovers
But the same fire that warms the heart can burn
Then it's lovers, friends, strangers again
Ain't it funny how the circle turns

Ain't it funny how the circle turns..."

I finally learned my destination and all my roads lead back to you

All my roads lead back to you
All my roads lead back to you
It's made no difference where I go or what I do
All my roads lead back to you

I've climbed up life's highest mountain and I've come down the other side
Every rainbow ends in nothing dreams can't take you for a ride
Maybe cause I'm gettin' older or I'm finally gettin' wise
All my thoughts turn to exploring the country hidden in your eyes

All my roads lead back to you
All my roads lead back to you
It's made no difference where I go or what I do

American girls and American guys
We'll always stand up and salute, we'll always recognize
When we see Old Glory flyin', there's a lot of men dead
So, we can sleep in peace at night when we lay down our head

[Verse 1]
My daddy served in the army, where he lost his right eye
But he flew a flag out in our yard 'til the day that he died
He wanted my mother, my brother, my sister, and me
To grow up and live happy in the land of the free

[Verse 2]
Now this nation that I love has fallen under attack
A mighty sucker punch came flyin' in from somewhere in the back
Soon as we could see it clearly through our big black eye
Man, we lit up your world like the Fourth of July

Hey, Uncle Sam put your name at the top of his list
And the Statue of Liberty started shakin' her fist
And the eagle will fly and it’s gonna be hell
When you hear Mother Freedom start ringin' her bell
And it'll feel like the whole wide world is rainin' down on you
Aw, brought to you courtesy of the red, white, and blue

Oh, justice will be served, and the battle will rage
This big dog will fight when you rattle his cage
And you'll be sorry that you messed with the U.S. of A

Can't leave it up to him, he's knocking on my door
And I knew all of my life, that someday it would end
Get up and go outside, don't let the old man in

Many moons I have lived
My body's weathered and worn
Ask yourself how old would you be
If you didn't know the day you were born

Try to love on your wife
And stay close to your friends
Toast each sundown with wine
Don't let the old man in

Many moons I have lived

Round up all of them bad boys hang them high in the street
For all the people to see

That justice is the one thing you should always find
You gotta saddle up your boys
You gotta draw a hard line
When the gun smoke settles we'll sing a victory tune
And we'll all meet back at the local saloon
We'll raise up our glasses against evil forces
Singin' whiskey for my men, beer for my horses

[Verse 3]
We got too many gangsters doing dirty deeds
We've got too much corruption, too much crime in the streets
It’s time the long arm of the law put a few more in the ground
Send them all to their maker and he'll settle them down
You can bet he'll set them down 'cause

[Chorus]
Justice is the one thing you should always find
You gotta saddle up your boys
You gotta draw a hard line
When the gun smoke settles we'll sing a victory tune
We'll all meet back at the local saloon
We'll raise up our glasses against evil forces
Singin' whiskey for my men, beer for my horses

Justice is the one thing you should always find
You gotta saddle up your boys
You gotta draw a hard line
When the gun smoke settles we'll sing a victory tune
We'll all meet back at the local saloon
We'll raise up our glasses against evil forces
Singin' whiskey for my men, beer for my horses"
Toby Keith,Should’ve Been a Cowboy,"[Verse 1]
I'll bet you've never heard ol' Marshal Dillon say
""Miss Kitty, have you ever thought of runnin' away
Settlin' down, would you marry me
If I asked you twice and begged you pretty please?""
She'd have said yes in a New York minute
They never tied the knot, his heart wasn't in it
He just stole a kiss as he rode away
He never hung his hat up
At Kitty's place

[Chorus]
I should've been a cowboy
I should've learned to rope and ride
Wearin' my six-shooter
Ridin' my pony on a cattle drive
Stealin' the young girls' hearts
Just like Gene and Roy
Singin' those campfire songs
Oh, I should've been a cowboy

[Verse 2]
I might've had a sidekick with a funny name
Runnin' wild through the hills chasin' Jesse James
Endin' up on the brink of danger
Ridin' shotgun for the Texas Rangers
Go west, young man, haven't you been told
California's full of whiskey, women and gold
Sleepin' out all night beneath the desert stars
With a dream in my eye, and a prayer in my heart

[Chorus]
I should've been a cowboy
I should've learned to rope and ride
Wearin' my six-shooter
Ridin' my pony on a cattle drive
Stealin' the young girls' hearts
Just like Gene and Roy
Singin' those campfire songs
Oh, I should've been a cowboy

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
I should've been a cowboy
I should've learned to rope and ride
I'd be wearin' my six-shooter
Ridin' my pony on a cattle drive
Stealin' the young girls' hearts
Just like Gene and Roy
Singin' those campfire songs
Oh, I should've been a cowboy

[Outro]
Yeah, I should've been a cowboy
I should've been a cowboy"
Toby Keith,Red Solo Cup,"[Intro]
One, two, a one, two, three

[Verse 1]
Now, red Solo cup is the best receptacle
For barbecues, tailgates, fairs, and festivals
And you, sir, do not have a pair of testicles
If you prefer drinking from glass
Hey, red Solo cup is cheap and disposable
In 14 years, they are decomposable
And unlike my home, they are not foreclosable
Freddy Mac can kiss my ass
Whoo!

[Chorus]
Red Solo cup
I fill you up
Let's have a party
Let's have a party
I love you, red Solo cup
I lift you up
Proceed to party
Proceed to party

[Verse 2]
Now, I really love how you're easy to stack
But I really hate how you're easy to crack
'Cause when beer runs down the front of my back
Well, that, my friends, is quite yucky
But I have to admit that the ladies get smitten
Admiring at how sharply my first name is written
On you with a Sharpie when I get to hittin'
On them to help me get lucky

[Chorus]
Red Solo cup
I fill you up
Let's have a party
Let's have a party
I love you, red Solo cup (What?)
I lift you up
Proceed to party
Proceed to party (Proceed to party)

[Verse 3]
Now, I've seen you in blue and I've seen you in yellow
But only you, red, will do for this fellow
'Cause you are the Abbott to my Costello
And you are the Fruit to my Loom (Here we go now)
Red Solo cup, you're more than just plastic
You're more than amazing, you're more than fantastic
And believe me that I'm not the least bit sarcastic
When I look at you and say

[Bridge]
Red Solo cup, you're not just a cup
(No! No! No! God, no! )
You're my-you're my (Friend?) friend
(Friend, friend, friend, life-long)
Thank you for being my friend

[Chorus]
Red Solo cup
(That's what I am talking about)
I fill you up
Let's have a party
(Let's have a party)
Let's have a party
(Let's have a party)
I love you, red Solo cup
I lift you up
Proceed to party
Proceed to party
Red Solo cup
Red Solo
(I fill you up, let's have a party)
Let's have a party
(Let's have a party)
Let's have a party
(Red Solo cup)
Oh red Solo cup
(I lift you up)
Let's have a party
Proceed to party, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
(Solo cup, solo cup, solo cup)
(Solo cup, solo cup, solo cup)

Toby Keith,As Good As I Once Was,"[Verse 1]
She said, ""I've seen you in here before.""
I said, ""I've been here a time or two.""
She said, ""Hello, my name is Bobby Jo
Meet my twin sister Betty Lou
And we're both feeling kinda wild tonight
You're the only cowboy in this place
And if you're up for a rodeo
I'll put a big Texas smile on your face""
I said, ""Girls,""

[Chorus]
I ain't as good as I once was
I got a few years on me now
But there was a time back in my prime
When I could really lay it down
And if you need some love tonight
Then I might have just enough
I ain't as good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was

[Verse 2]
I still hang out with my best friend Dave
I've known him since we were kids at school
Last night he had a few shots
Got in a tight spot hustling a game of pool
With a couple of redneck boys
One great big bad biker man
I heard David yell across the room
""Hey buddy, how 'bout a helping hand?""
I said, ""Dave,""

[Chorus]
I ain't as good as I once was
My, how the years have flown
But there was a time back in my prime
When I could really hold my own
But if you wanna fight tonight
Guess those boys don't look all that tough
I ain't as good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was

[Bridge]
I used to be hell on wheels
Back when I was a younger man
Now my body says, ""You can't do this boy""
But my pride says, ""Oh, yes you can""

[Chorus]
I ain't as good as I once was
That's just the cold hard truth
I still throw a few back, talk a little smack
When I'm feeling bullet proof
So don't double dog dare me now
Cause I'd have to call your bluff
I ain't as good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was
May not be good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was"
Toby Keith,Made in America,"[Verse 1]
My old man's that old man, spent his life livin' off the land
Dirty hands and a clean soul
It breaks his heart seein' foreign cars filled with fuel that isn't ours
And wearin' cotton we didn't grow

[Chorus]
He's got the red, white, blue flyin' high on the farm
Semper Fi tattooed on his left arm
Spend a little more at the store for a tag
In the back that says U-S-A
He won't buy nothin' that he can't fix
With WD-40 and a Craftsman wrench
He ain't prejudiced, he's just
Made in America

[Verse 2]
He loves his wife, but she's that wife that decorates on the 4th of July
But says, ""Every day's Independence Day""
She's golden rule, teaches school, some folks say it isn't cool
But she says the Pledge of Allegiance anyway

[Chorus]
He's got the red, white, blue flyin' high on the farm
Semper Fi tattooed on his left arm
Spend a little more in the store for a tag
In the back that says U-S-A
He won't buy nothin' that he can't fix
With WD-40 and a Craftsman wrench
He ain't prejudiced, he's just
Made in America

[Bridge]
Born in the heartland, raised up a family
Of King James and Uncle Sam

[Chorus]
He's got the red, white, blue flyin' high on the farm
Semper Fi tattooed on his left arm
Spend a little more in the store for a tag
In the back that says U-S-A
Won't buy nothin' that he can't fix
With WD-40 and a Craftsman wrench
He ain't prejudiced, he's just
Made in America

[Outro]
Made in America
Made in America
Yeah, my old man's that old man
Made in America"
Toby Keith,I Love This Bar,"[Verse 1]
We got winners, we got losers
Chain smokers and boozers
And we got yuppies, we got bikers
We got thirsty hitchhikers
And the girls next door dress up like movie stars

[Hook]
Hmm, hmm, hmm I love this bar

[Verse 2]
We got cowboys, we got truckers
Broken-hearted fools and suckers
And we got hustlers, we got fighters
Early birds and all-nighters
And the veterans talk about their battle scars

[Hook]
Hmm, hmm, hmm I love this bar

[Chorus 1]
I love this bar
It's my kind of place
Just walkin' through the front door
Puts a big smile on my face
It ain't too far, come as you are

[Hook]
Hmm, hmm, hmm I love this bar

[Verse 3]
I've seen short skirts, we got high-techs
Blue-collar boys and rednecks
And we got lovers, lots of lookers
And I've even seen dancing girls and hookers
And we like to drink our beer from a mason jar

[Hook]
Hmm, hmm, hmm I love this bar
Yes I do

[Instrumental Break]
2:34 - 2:51

[Bridge]
I like my truck (I like my truck)
I like my girlfriend (I like my girlfriend)
I like to take her out to dinner
I like a movie now and then

[Chorus]
But I love this bar
It's my kind of place
Just trollin' around the dance floor
Puts a big smile on my face
No cover charge, come as you are

[Hook]
Hmm, hmm, hmm I love this bar
Hmm, hmm, hmm I just love this 'ol bar

[Verse 4: Omitted from Single Version]
We got divorcees and a big bouncer man
An old jukebox and a real bad band
We got waitresses and we got barflies
A dumb-ass and a wise-guy
If you get too drunk just sleep out in your car

[Hook: Omitted from Single Version]
Reason number 672 why
Hmm, hmm, hmm I just love this bar

[Outro: Omitted from Single Version]
Play it on out boys
Beer-thirty's over
Got to take it on home
Hmm, hmm, hmm I love this bar
I just love it"
Toby Keith,American Ride,"[Verse 1]
Winter gettin' colder, summer gettin' warmer
Tidal wave come across the Mexican border
Why buy a gallon, it's cheaper by the barrel
Just don't get busted singin' Christmas carols

[Chorus]
That's us, that's right
Gotta love this American ride
Both ends of the ozone burnin'
Funny how the world keeps turnin'
Look ma, no hands
I love this American ride
Gotta love this American ride

[Verse 2]
Momma gets her rocks off watchin' Desperate Housewives
Daddy works his ass off payin' for the good life
Kids on the YouTube learning how to be cool
Livin' in a cruel world, pays to be a mean girl

[Chorus]
That's us, that's right
Gotta love this American ride
Both ends of the ozone burnin'
Funny how the world keeps turnin'
Look ma, no hands
I love this American ride
Gotta love this American ride

[Verse 3]
Poor little infamous, America's town
She gained five pounds and lost her crown
Quick fix plastic surgical antidote
Got herself a record deal, can't even sing a note

[Verse 4]
Plasma gettin' bigger, Jesus getting smaller
Spill a cup of coffee, make a million dollars
Customs caught a thug with an aerosol can
If the shoe don't fit, the fits gonna hit the shan

[Outro]
That's us, that's right
Gotta love this American ride
Both ends of the ozone burning
Funny how the world keeps turning
Hot dog, hot damn
I love this American ride
Gotta love this American ride

Toby Keith,American Soldier,"[Verse 1]
I'm just trying to be a father
Raise a daughter and a son
Be a lover to their mother
Everything to everyone
Up and at them bright and early
I'm all business in my suit
Yeah, I'm dressed for success
From my head down to my boots

[Verse 2]
I don't do it for money there's still bills that I can't pay
I don't do it for the glory, I just do it anyway
Providing for our future's my responsibility
Yeah I'm real good under pressure, being all that I can be
And I can't call in sick on Mondays
When the weekends been to strong
I just work straight through the holidays
And sometimes all night long

[Verse 3]
You can bet that I stand ready when the wolf growls at the door
Hey, I'm solid, hey I'm steady, hey I'm true down to the core
And I will always do my duty, no matter what the price
I've counted up the cost, I know the sacrifice
Oh, and I don't want to die for you
But if dying's asked of me
I'll bear that cross with honor
Cause freedom don't come free

[Chorus]
I'm an American soldier, an American
Beside my brothers and my sisters I will proudly take a stand
When liberty's in jeopardy I will always do what's right
I'm out here on the front lines, so sleep in peace tonight
American soldier, I'm an American
An American
An American Soldier"
Toby Keith,Happy Birthday America,"[Chorus]
Happy birthday America
It's the Fourth of July
I get to wake up in your freedom
But sometimes I wonder why
Seems like everybody's pissin'
On the red, white and blue
Happy birthday America
Whatever's left of you

[Verse 1]
You were the darlin' when you saved the world
WW I and II
France would just be part of Germany now
If it hadn't been for you

[Verse 2]
Now your children wanna turn you in
To something other than yourself
They burn your flag in their city streets
More than anybody else

[Chorus]
Happy birthday America
It's the Fourth of July
I get to wake up in your freedom
But sometimes I wonder why
Seems like everybody's pissin'
On the red, white and blue
Happy birthday America
Whatever's left of you

[Verse 3]
Who they gonna count on
When you're not there to take their call?
Will the world keep right on spinnin'
Without the greatest of them all?
Without the helping hand of God
Your days are numbered, my old friend
We're sure gonna miss you, girl
You were the best that's ever been
Happy birthday America

[Bridge]
All the broken-down cities
By the left's design
And the right can't seem to get it right
Most of the time
Every time I go to town and vote
I just come home with the blues
The lesser of two evils
All we ever get to choose

[Chorus]
Happy birthday America
It's the Fourth of July
I'll get to wake up in your freedom
But sometimes I wonder why
Seems like everybody's pissin'
On the red, white and blue
Happy birthday America
Whatever's left of you
Happy birthday America"
Toby Keith,Weed with Willie,"I always heard that his herb was top shelf
Lord I just could not wait to find out for myself
Well don't knock it till you've tried it
And I've tried it my friend
I'll never smoke Weed with Willie again!

Now we learned a hard lesson in a small Texas town
He fired up a fat boy and he passed it around
The last words I spoke before they tucked me in
I may discount Bungee jump
But I'll never smoke weed with Willie again

I'll never smoke weed with Willie again
My party's all over before it begins
You can pour me some Old Whiskey River my friend
But I'll never smoke weed with Willie again

We hopped on his old bus the Honeysuckle Rose
The party was Huntsville, it was after the show
Alone in the front lounge, just me and him
I took one friendly puff and the grim creeper set in

I'll never smoke weed with Willie again
My party's all over before it begins
You can pour me some Old Whiskey River my friend
But I'll never smoke weed with Willie again

Now we're passing the guitar, we're telling good jokes
I can tell one's a coming because I'm smelling smoke
No I do not partake I just let it pass by
With a grin on my face and a great contact high
I'll never smoke weed with Willie again
My party's all over before it begins
You can pour me some Old Whiskey River my friend
But I'll never smoke weed with Willie again
In the fetal position with drool on my chin
We broke down and smoked weed with Willie again

Toby Keith,How Do You Like Me Now?!,"[Verse 1]
Hey, I was always the crazy one, broke into the stadium
And I wrote your number on the fifty-yard line
You were always the perfect one and a valedictorian so
Under your number, I wrote ""call for a good time""
I only wanted to get your attention
But you overlooked me somehow
Besides, you had too many boyfriends to mention
And I played my guitar too loud
How do you like me now?

[Chorus]
How do you like me now, now that I'm on my way?
Do you still think I'm crazy standing here today?
I couldn't make you love me, but I always dreamed about
Livin' in your radio, how do you like me now?

[Verse 2]
When I took off to Tennessee, I heard that you made fun of me
Never imagined I'd make it this far
Then you married into money, girl, ain't it a cruel and funny world?
He took your dreams and he tore them apart
He never comes home and you're always alone
And your kids hear you cry down the hall
Alarm clock starts ringing, who could that be singin'?
It's me, baby, with your wake-up call
How do you like me now?

[Chorus]
How do you like me now, now that I'm on my way?
Do you still think I'm crazy standing here today?
I couldn't make you love me, but I always dreamed about
Livin' in your radio, how do you like me now? Yeah

How do you like me now, now that I'm on my way?

Toby Keith,I Wanna Talk About Me,"[Intro]
Yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
We talk about your work, how your boss is a jerk
We talk about your church and your head when it hurts
We talk about the troubles you've been having with your brother
About your daddy and your mother and your crazy ex-lover
We talk about your friends and the places that you've been
We talk about your skin and the dimples on your chin
The polish on your toes and the run in your hose
And God knows we're gonna talk about your clothes
You know talking about you makes me smile
But every once in awhile

[Chorus]
I wanna talk about me
Wanna talk about I
Wanna talk about number one
Oh my, me my
What I think, what I like, what I know, what I want, what I see
I like talking about you, you, you, you, usually, but occasionally
I wanna talk about me (me, me, me, me)
I wanna talk about me (me, me, me, me)

[Verse 2]
We talk about your dreams and we talk about your schemes
Your high school team and your moisturizer cream
We talk about your nanna up in Muncie, Indiana
We talk about your grandma down in Alabama
We talk about your guys of every shape and size
The ones that you despise and the ones you idolize
We talk about your heart, about your brains and your smarts
And your medical charts and when you start
You know talking about you makes me grin
But every now and then

[Chorus]
I wanna talk about me
Wanna talk about I
Wanna talk about number one
Oh my me my
What I think, what I like, what I know, what I want, what I see
I like talking about you, you, you, you, usually, but occasionally

Toby Keith,The Taliban Song,"[Verse 1]
""I'm just a middle-aged, middle-eastern camel herding man
I got a little, 2 bedroom cave here in North Afghanistan
Things used to be real nice and they got out of hand when they moved in
They call themselves the Taliban
(o yeah the Taliban) (Taliban baby)

Now I ain't seen my wife's face since they came here
They make her wear a scarf over her head that covers her from ear to ear
She loves the desert and the hot white sand
But man she's just like me, nah she can't stand
The Taliban (o Taliban baby)

[Chorus]
You know someday soon we're both going to saddle up and it'll be
Ride Camel Ride
My old lady she'll be here with me, smiling right by my side
We should do just fine out around Palestine or maybe Turkmenistan
We'll bid a fair adieu and flip the finger to the Taliban
(oh yeah the Taliban) (baby)

[Verse 2]
I know where you coming from brother!
This is a patriotic love song
So y'all feel free to salute if you want
You got my permission

Now they attacked New York City cause they thought they could win
Said they would, stand and fight until the very bloody end
Mr. Bush got on the phone with Iraq and Iran and said ""Now, you
Sons-of-bitches you better not be doing any business with the Taliban""
(Taliban baby)

So we prayed to Allah with all of our might
Until those big U.S. jets came flying one night
They dropped little bombs all over their holy land
And man you should have seen them run like rabbits, they ran
(the Taliban)

[Chorus]
You know someday soon we're both going to saddle up and it'll be
Ride Camel Ride
My old lady she'll be here with me, smiling right by my side
We should do real fine out around Palestine or maybe Turkmenistan
We'll bid a fair adieu and flip a couple fingers to the Taliban
(oh yeah, Taliban)
We'll bid a fair adieu and flip a big boner to The Taliban (baby)"""
Toby Keith,God Love Her,"[Verse 1]
Just a girl born in Dixie
Washed in the blood
And raised on the banks
Of the Mississippi mud
She always had a thing
About falling in love with a bad boy

Yeah, they could see it all coming
But her daddy never dreamed
She'd grow up that fast
You know what I mean
The way a girl gets
When she turns 17
Kind of crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
She's a rebel child
And a preacher's daughter
She was baptized in dirty water
Her mama cried the first time
They caught her with me
They knew they couldn't stop her

[Chorus]
She holds tight to me and the Bible
On the back seat of my motorcycle
Left her daddy standing there
Preaching' to the choir
You see God love her
Oh me and God love her

[Verse 2]
She kissed her mama goodbye
Said I'll be sure 'n phone you
She called from a truck stop
In Tucson Arizona
With ""Amazing grace
We made California line""
And then my gypsy life
Started taking its toll
And the fast lane got empty
And out of control
And just like an angel
She saved my soul from the devil

[Pre-Chorus]
She's a rebel child
And a preacher's daughter
She was baptized in dirty water
Her mama cried the first time
They caught her with me
They knew they couldn't stop her

[Chorus]
She holds tight to me and the Bible
On the back seat of my motorcycle
Left her daddy standing there
Preaching' to the choir
You see God love her
Oh me and God love her

[Chorus]
Now she holds tight to me and the Bible
On the back seat of my motorcycle
Left her daddy standing there
Preaching to the choir
You see God love her
Oh me and God love her
God love her
Me and God love her"
Toby Keith,Wacky Tobaccy,"[Intro]
Ah, yeah
What's that smell?

[Verse 1]
Wanda is a woman she works down the hall
Shows up on time, she's like balls to the wall
She went out to lunch with her High School Friends
'Bout three hours later she came rollin' back in
Well, the boss man really jumped her
Son he wasn't joking
Everybody in the office knew Wanda had been smokin'

[Chorus]
That old Wacky Tobaccy
When you feel it creeping up on you
That old Wacky Tobaccy
Kick back and let it do what it do

[Verse 2]
Know you can two tote her, you can one hit him
Puff it in a pipe and you can twist it in a stem
You can bake it in some brownies, smoke it through a Bong
Roll up a great big fat one like ol' Cheech and Chong
Burn it through a hole
In a can of Budweiser
If you can't take the heat son vaporizer

[Chorus]
That old Wacky Tobaccy
When you feel it creeping up on you
That old Wacky Tobaccy
Kick back and let it do what it do

Now do what you do
Oh, yeah

You got your Mexican and Jamaican with those buds of blue
Humboldt County and Hydroponic too
Okeechobee Purple from down in the South
And that ol' stuff your uncle smokes 'ill give you cotton mouth
Homegrown is healthy, synthetic can kill ya
My all-time favorite is redhead sensimilla

Sorry you missed me I'll get back to you as soon as I can, thank you and God bless

[Verse 1]
Got the news on Friday mornin'
But a tear I couldn't find
You showed me how I am supposed to live
And now you showed me how to die
I was lost 'til Sunday morning
I woke up to face my fear
While writing you this good-bye song I found a tear

I'm gonna miss that smile
I'm gonna miss you my friend
Even though it hurts the way it ended up
I'd do it all again
So play it sweet in Heaven

I'm not cryin' 'cause I feel so sorry for ya
I'm cryin' for me

I got up and dialed your number
And your voice came on the line
With that old familiar message
I've heard a thousand times
It just said, ""Sorry that I missed you
Leave a message and God bless""
I know that you think I'm crazy
But I had to hear your voice I guess

I guess those college boys all went home for the summertime
Yeah, you’re looking right, looking good, looking like a woman should
So why is it so hard to find
A place to lay your pretty little head down once in a while?

[Pre-Chorus]
You run on a little tough luck baby, ha
Don’t you sweat it
Everything is waiting inside for you
You know I got it
Come and get it

[Chorus]
Who’s your daddy, who’s your baby?
Who’s your buddy, who’s your friend?
And who’s the one guy that you come running to
When your love life starts tumbling?
I got the money if you got the honey
Let’s cut a deal let’s make a plan
Who’s your daddy, who’s your baby?
Who’s your buddy, who’s your man?

[Pre-Chorus]
You might’ve run on a little tough luck baby, did ya
Don’t you sweat it
Everything is waiting inside for you
You know I got it
So come and get it

[Chorus]
Who’s your daddy, who’s your baby?
Who’s your buddy, who’s your friend?
And who’s the one guy that you come running to
When your love life starts tumbling?
I got the money if you got the honey
Let’s cut a deal let’s make a plan
Who’s your daddy, who’s your baby?
Who’s your buddy, who’s your man?
Who’s your daddy, who’s your baby?
Who’s your buddy, who’s your man?"
Toby Keith,My List,"[Verse 1]
Under an old brass paperweight
Is my list of things to do today
Go to the bank and the hardware store
Put a new lock on the cellar door
I cross 'em off as I get 'em done but when the sun is set
There's still more than a few things left I haven't got to yet

[Chorus]
Go for a walk, say a little prayer
Take a deep breath of mountain air
Put on my glove and play some catch
It's time that I make time for that
Wade the shore and cast a line
Look up a long lost friend of mine
Sit on the porch and give my girl a kiss
Start living, that's the next thing on my list

[Verse 2]
Wouldn't change the course of fate
But cutting the grass just had to wait
Cause I've got more important things
Like pushing' my kid on the backyard swing
I won't break my back for a million bucks
I can't take to my grave
So why put off for tomorrow what I could get done today...

[Chorus]
Like go for a walk, say a little prayer
Take a deep breath of mountain air
Put on my glove and play some catch
It's time that I make time for that
Wade the shore and cast a line
Look up a long lost friend of mine
Sit on the porch and give my girl a kiss
Start living, that's the next thing on my list

[Chorus 2]
Raise a little hell, laugh 'till it hurts
Put an extra five in the plate at church
Call up my folks just to chat
It's time that I make time for that
Stay up late, then oversleep
Show her what she means to me
Catch up on all the things I've always missed
Just start living', that's the next thing on my list

[Outro]
Under an old brass paperweight
Is my list of things to do today"
Toby Keith,Wish I Didn’t Know Now,"[Verse 1]
I never ask you where you're goin'
I've never asked you where you've been
I've never called and checked your story
You stayed out with all your friends
I've never tried to catch you lyin'
I didn't want to know the truth
I'd rather go on lovin' blind, girl
Than go on lovin' without you

[Chorus]
I wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then
I wish I could start this whole thing over again
I'm not sayin' that you, could ever be true
I just don't want to know how it ends
You'd still have my heart in the palm of your hand
I'd still look like a fool in front of your friends
Yeah, I wish somehow, I didn't know now
What I didn't know then

[Verse 2]
I've always said what I don't know
Couldn't hurt as bad as leavin' you
Turns out I knew what I was thinkin'
It ain't an easy thing to do
Well, I guess I should be goin'
I sure found out too much to stay
Please don't say you're sorry
I might wait another day

[Chorus]
I wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then
I wish I could start this whole thing over again
I'm not sayin' that you, could ever be true
I just don't want to know how it ends
You'd still have my heart in the palm of your hand
I'd still look like a fool in front of your friends
Yeah, I wish somehow, I didn't know now
What I didn't know then

[Interlude]

[Refrain]
You'd still have my heart in the palm of your hand
I'd still look like a fool in front of your friends
Yeah, I wish somehow, I didn't know now
What I didn't know then

[Outro]
Yeah, I wish somehow, I didn't know now
What I didn't know then"
Toby Keith,Call A Marine,"[Verse 1]
I was sittin' in a bar, boozin' and losin'
And some jackoff walks up cruisin' for a bruisin'
Poppin' off and makin' my whole redneck red
He asked my girl if she'd like to dance
He had three buddies so I had no chance
I looked around the room for a friend and I saw Fred
A quick evaluation of the situation
And we entered into a conversation
It seemed to last the better part of the next two songs
Now I didn't say and they didn't ask
But Fred did two tours over in Iraq
And, son, it was over before it was even on

[Chorus]
Call a Marine
Instead of 911
They're built to improvise, adapt and overcome
When you're in knee deep and you're up shit's creek
And you've tried everything
Tell you what you do
Call a Marine!

[Verse 2]
Now my sister's husband didn't love her no more
And he runned off with a skinny little whore
And left her sittin' around the house with a couple of kids
She just lays around in that muumuu gown
Old girl put on about 35 pounds
One day I went over to her house and I said, ""Hey, sis""
If you wanna fix what troubles you
Just ease down to the VFW
And you'll walk through the door and turns those boys' heads
For most of those boys it's been awhile
Just show a little leg and that Marlboro smile
And if that don't work out for you, girl, ask for Fred

[Chorus]
Call a Marine
Instead of 911
They're built to improvise, adapt and overcome
If you're in knee deep and you're up shit's creek
You've tried everything
Tell you what you do
Call a Marine!

[Bridge]
Some douche bag rises up and overthrows his government
Diplomacy ain't workin' and the ammos all been spent
The world is in a crisis and the media's a curse
I'll tell you what to do
When it goes from bad to worse

[Chorus]
Call a Marine
Instead of 911
They're built to improvise, adapt and overcome
When you're in knee deep and you're up shit's creek
And you've tried everything
Tell you what you do
Call a Marine!

Tell you what to do, baby
You can call
Call a Marine!
Yeah! Yeah!"
Toby Keith,Shitty Golfer,"[Intro]
I'm a shitty golfer, you can ask my wife
I've been out there hackin' every day of my life
I got the shorts and all the plaid sweaters
And new Taylormade driver didn't make me any better

[Verse 1]
Man, I hit 'em fast and I hit 'em thin
I roll 'em in the bunker's man, I hit 'em again
Slice 'em in the bushes, crank 'em in a creek
I popped that sucker up and hooked it out in the street

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm 2-45 right down the middle
And I'll miss the green, to the left just a little
Chili dip a wedge, and put it all together
Hit that son of a bitch right up there in the leather
If you call that good, and let me press on the side
You can put me down for a five

[Verse 2]
Hey, I'm a shitty golfer, most of us are
But we carry our clubs in the back of our cars
What else you gonna do when you're out of town
And you need to waste a whole day and shoot another round

[Verse 3]
Man, I played Augusta, and I played Pebble Beach
And one time at Sawgrass I shot 83
If I live long enough to be 88
I think I'll celebrate it by shooting my age

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm 2-45 right down the middle
And I'll miss the green, to the left just a little
Chili dip a wedge, and put it all together
Hit that son of a bitch right up there in the leather
If you call that good, and let me press on the side
You can put me down for a five, oh yeah
You can put me down for a five"
Toby Keith,Who’s That Man,"[Verse 1]
Turn left at the old hotel
I know this boulevard much too well
It hasn't changed since I've been gone
Ah, this used to be my way home

[Verse 2]
They paved the road through the neighborhood
I guess the county finally fixed it good
It was gettin' rough
Someone finally complained enough

[Verse 3]
Fight the tears back with a smile
Stop and look for a little while
Oh, it's plain to see
The only thing missing is me

[Chorus]
That's my house and that's my car
That's my dog in my back yard
There's the window to the room
Where she lays her pretty head
I planted that tree out by the fence
Not long after we moved in
There's my kids and that's my wife
Who's that man running my life?

[Verse 4]
If I pulled in, would it cause a scene?
They're not really expectin' me
Those kids have been through hell
I hear they've adjusted well

[Verse 5]
Turn around in the neighbor's drive
I'd be hard to recognize
In this pickup truck
It's just an old fixer-up

[Verse 6]
Drive away one more time
A lot of things going through my mind
I guess the less things change
The more they never seem the same

[Chorus]
That's my house and that's my car
That's my dog in my back yard
There's the window to the room
Where she lays her pretty head
I planted that tree out by the fence
Not long after we moved in
There's my kids and that's my wife
Who's that man running my life?"
Toby Keith,You Shouldn’t Kiss Me Like This,"[Verse 1]
I got a funny feelin'
The moment that your lips touched mine
Somethin' shot right through me
My heart skipped a beat in time
There's a different feel about you tonight
It's got me thinkin' lots of crazy things
I even think I saw a flash of light
It felt like electricity

[Chorus]
You shouldn't kiss me like this, unless you mean it like that
'Cause I'll just close my eyes and I won't know where I'm at
And we'll get lost on this dance floor, spinnin' around
And around and around and around
They're all watchin' us now, they think we're fallin' in love
They'd never believe we're just friends
When you kiss me like this, I think you mean it like that
If you do, baby, kiss me again

[Bridge]
Everybody swears we make the perfect pair
But dancing is as far as it goes
Girl, you've never moved me
Quite the way you moved me tonight
I just wanted you to know
I just wanted you to know

[Chorus]
You shouldn't kiss me like this, unless you mean it like that
'Cause I'll just close my eyes and I won't know where I'm at
And we'll get lost on this dance floor, spinnin' around
And around and around and around
They're all watchin' us now, they think we're fallin' in love
They'd never believe we're just friends
When you kiss me like this, I think you mean it like that
If you do, baby, kiss me again
Kiss me again"
Jerry Reed,East Bound and Down,"[Chorus]
East bound and down, loaded up and truckin'
We gonna do what they say can't be done
We've got a long way to go and a short time to get there
I'm east bound, just watch ol' Bandit run

[Verse 1]
Keep your foot hard on the pedal
Son, never mind them brakes
Let it all hang out 'cause we've got a run to make
The boys are thirsty in Atlanta
And there's beer in Texarkana
And we'll bring it back no matter what it takes

[Chorus]
East bound and down, loaded up and truckin'
We gonna do what they say can't be done
We've got a long way to go and a short time to get there
I'm east bound, just watch ol' Bandit run

East bound and down, loaded up and truckin'
We gonna do what they say can't be done
We've got a long way to go and a short time to get there
I'm east bound, just watch ol' Bandit run

[Verse 2]
Old Smokey's got them ears on
He's hot on your trail
And he ain't gonna rest 'til you're in jail
So you got to dodge him, you got to duck him
You've gotta keep that diesel truckin'
Just put that hammer down and give it hell

[Chorus]
East bound and down, loaded up and truckin'
We gonna do what they say can't be done
We've got a long way to go and a short time to get there
I'm east bound, just watch ol' Bandit run"
Jerry Reed,Amos Moses,"Yeah, here comes Amos

[Verse 1]
Now Amos Moses was a Cajun
He lived by his self in the swamp
He hunted alligator for livin'
He just knock 'em in the head with a stump
The Louisiana law gonna get you Amos!
It ain't legal huntin' alligator down in the swamp boy!

[Verse 2]
Now everybody blamed his old man
For makin' him mean as a snake
When Amos Moses was a boy
His Daddy would use him for alligator bait
Tie a rope around his waist and throw him in the swamp
Alligator bait in the Louisiana Bayou

[Chorus]
About forty-five minutes southeast of Thibodeaux, Louisiana
Lived a man called Doc Millsap and his pretty wife Hanna
Well they raised up a son
Who could eat up his weight in groceries
Named him after a man of the cloth
Called him Amos Moses

[Verse 3]
Now the folks around south Louisiana
Said Amos was a hell of a man
He could trap the biggest, the meanest alligator
And just use one hand
That's all he got left cuz alligator bit it!
Left arm gone clean up to the elbow!

[Verse 4]
Well the Sheriff got wind that Amos
Was in the swamp tracking alligator skin
So he snuck in the swamp, gonna get the boy
But he never come out again
Well I wonder where the Louisiana Sheriff went to?
Well you can sure get lost in the Louisiana Bayou!

[Chorus]
About forty-five minutes southeast of Thibodeaux, Louisiana
Lived a cat called Doc Millsap and his pretty wife Hanna
Well, they raised up a son
Who could eat up his weight in groceries
Named him after a man of the cloth,
Called him Amos Moses

[Outro]
Set out on 'em Amos
Make it count, Son!

About forty-five minutes southeast of Thibodeaux, Louisiana"
Jerry Reed,The Legend,"You heard about the legend of Jesse James
And John Henry, just to mention some names
But there's a truck-drivin' legend in the South today
A man called Bandit from Atlanta, G.A
Every gearjammer knows his name
They swear he got ice water runnin' in his veins
A foot like lead and nerves like steel
He's gonna go to glory ridin' eighteen wheels
Oh, honey hooves [?]

Well, he left Atlanta back in '63
Haulin' him a load up to Tennessee
He hit Monteagle and it started to rain
So hard he couldn't even see the passin' lane

Well, he started downgrade when he lost a gear
He reached for the brakes, found he had no air
That Monteagle grade is steep and long
And everybody that seen it thought the Bandit was gone
Well[?], well listen now

Well, his truck jack-knifed, turned completely 'round
He was comin' down backwards, 'bout the speed of sound
A lot of folks seen him, and they all say
He had his head out the window, yellin', Clear the way

Well, he got to the bottom, safe and sound
Everybody asked Bandit how he made it down
He said, Folks, when the truck picked up too much speed
I just run along beside it and drug my feet

You heard the legend of Jesse James
And John Henry, just to mention some names
Well, there's a truck-drivin' legend in the South today
A man called Bandit from Atlanta, G.A
Every gearjammer knows his name
They swear he's got ice water runnin' in his veins
A foot like lead and nerves like steel
He's gonna go to glory ridin' eighteen wheels

Aww, help him get down [?]
Mercy [?]
Get down, hon' [?]"
Jerry Reed,The Ballad Of Gator Mcklusky,"He was raised in the swamp
In the back of a slough
He grew up eatin' rattlesnake meat
And drinkin' homemade brew
Now folks here about call him Gator
And everybody knows him well
Meanest man ever to hit the swamp
Folks swear he come straight outta hell

Well Gator Mcklusky sittin' on a stump
Hammer pulled back on a twelve gauge pump
Watchin' that swamp lookin' out for the law
While he make the best corn liquor you ever saw

(Rot gut whiskey...)

While he's makin' that mash he watches and he looks
Old Gator he knows that swamp like a book
Somethin' out there movin' Gator whaddaya see
Ain't nothin' but the snakes and the gators and me

Everything's okey-dokey in the Okefenokee
That sheriff ain't snoopin' around
So cook that moonshine down
'Til it's good and clear
Everything's okey-dokey in the Okefenokee
That sheriff he'd soon mess around with the devil
Than to get his self long messin' around in here

One day he was cookin' some mash he was almost done
When they spotted the law and they had to run
So he headed for the swamp and they followed him in
But the law might as well been a-chasin' the wind

(Look out for that snake, sheriff...)

Well they chased on back through the muck and the slime
To the back of that swamp where the sun don't shine
But the law won't never catch Gator my friend
'Cause he knows that swamp like the back of his hand

Watch out boys old smokey's in the Okefenokee
The sheriff's out there snoopin' around
So shut that business down
And let's disappear
Look out boys old smokey's in the Okefenokee
But that sheriff he's really gonna catch the devil
If he keeps on snoopin' around in here

(Gator's in the swamp, sheriff...)
(Go get him...)
(If you can...)

(Careful, sheriff...)
(Don't let that gator bite you on your gonads...)"
Jerry Reed,West Bound and Down,"[Chorus]

Jerry Reed,"When You’re Hot, You’re Hot","[Verse 1]
Well, now me and Homer Jones and Big John Talley
Had a big crap game goin' back in the alley
And I kept rollin' them sevens and winnin' all them pots
My luck was so good, I could do no wrong
I just kept on rollin' and controllin' them bones
Finally, they just threw up their hands and said
""When you hot, you hot,"" I said, ""Yeah""

[Chorus]
When you're hot, you're hot
And when you're not, you're not
Put all the money in and let's roll 'em again
When you're hot, you're hot
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la, when you're hot, you're hot

[Verse 2]
Well, now every time I rolled them dice, I'd win
And I was just gettin' ready to roll 'em again
When I heard somethin' behind me
I turned around and there was a big old cop
He said, ""Hello, boys,"" then he gave us a grin, said
""Look like I'm gon' have to haul y'all in
And keep all that money for evidence""
I said, ""Well, son when you hot, you hot,"" he said, ""Yeah""

[Chorus]
When you're hot, you're hot
And when you're not, you're not
""You can 'splain it all down at City Hall""
I said, ""Yeah, when you're hot, you're hot""
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la, when you're hot, you're hot

[Verse 3]
Well, when he took us in to court, I couldn't believe my eyes
The judge was a fishin' buddy that I recognized
I said, ""Hey, judge, old buddy, old pal
I'll pay you that hundred I owe you if you'll get me outta this spot""
So he gave my friends a little fine to pay
He turned around and grinned at me and said
""Ninety days, Jerry, when you hot, you hot""
And I said, ""Thanks a lot""

[Chorus]
When you're hot, you're hot
And when you're not, you're not
He let my friends go free and throwed the book at me
He said, ""Well, when you're hot, you're hot""

[Outro]
I said, ""Well, I'll tell you one thing, judge, old buddy, old pal
If you wasn't wearin' that black robe
I'd take you out in back of this courthouse
And I'd try a little bit of your honor on""
""You understand that, you hillbilly?
Who's gonna collect my welfare? Pay for my Cadillac?
What do you mean ""Contempt of Court""?
Judge, oh, judge, judgie-poo"""
Jerry Reed,Lord Mr. Ford,"[Intro]
Well, if you're one of the millions who own one of them gas-drinking, piston-clanking, air-polluting, smoke-belching, four-wheeled buggies from Detroit City, then pay attention
I'm about to sing your song, son

[Verse 1]
Well, I'm not a man appointed judge
To bear ill will and hold a grudge
But I think it's time I said me a few choice words
All about that demon automobile
A metal box with the Polyglas wheel
The end result of the dream of Henry Ford

[Verse 2]
Well, I've got a car that's mine alone
That me and the finance company own
A ready-made pile of manufactured grief
And if I ain't out of gas in the pouring rain
I'm a-changin' a flat in a hurricane
I once spent three days lost on a cloverleaf

[Verse 3]
Well, it ain't just the smoke and the traffic jam
That makes me the bitter fool I am
But this four-wheel buggy is a-dollarin' me to death
For gas and oils and fluids and grease
And wires and tires and antifreeze
And them accessories, well, honey, that's something else

[Verse 4]
Well, you can get a stereo tape and a color TV
Get a back-seat bar and reclining seats
And just pay once a month, like you do your rent
Well, I figured it up and over a period of time
This four-thousand dollar car of mine
Costs fourteen thousand dollars
And ninety-nine cents

[Chorus]
Well, now, Lord, Mr. Ford, I just wish that you could see
What your simple horseless carriage has become
Well, it seems your contribution to man
To say the least, got a little out of hand
Well, Lord, Mr. Ford what have you done?

[Verse 5]
Now the average American father and mother
Own one whole car and half another
And I bet that half a car is a trick to drive, don't you?
But the thing that amazes me, I guess
Is the way we measure a man's success
By the kind of automobile he can afford to buy

[Verse 6]
Well, now, red light, green light, traffic cop
Right turn, no turn, must turn, stop
Get out the credit card, honey, we're out of gas
Well, now, all the cars placed end to end
Would reach to the moon and back again
And there'd probably be some poor fool who'd pull out to pass

[Verse 7]
Well, now, how I yearn for the good old days
Without that carbon dioxide haze
A-hanging over the roar of the interstate
Well, if the Lord that made the moon and the stars
Would have meant for me and you to have cars
He'd have seen that we was all born with a parking space

[Chorus]
Lord, Mr. Ford, I just wish that you could see
What your simple horseless carriage has become
Well, it seems your contribution to man
To say the least, got a little out of hand
Well, Lord, Mr. Ford, what have you done?

[Outro]
Come away with me, Lucille
In my smoking, choking automobile"
Jerry Reed,The Preacher and the Bear,"Yeah
Well the preacher went out a huntin' it was on one Sunday morn
It was against his religion but he took a shotgun along
He got himself a mess almighty fine quail and one old scraggly hare
And on the way home he crossed the path of a Great big grizzly bear

Well the bear got down lookin' ready to charge
The preacher never seen nothin' quite that large
They looked each other right smack in the eye
Didn't take that preacher long to say bye
The preacher he run till he spotted a tree
He said up in that tree's where I oughta be
By the time that bear made a grab for him
The preacher was a sittin' on top a that limb
Scared to death he tuned about
He looked to the sky and began to shout

Hey Lord you delivered Daniel from the bottom of the lion's den
You delivered Jonah from the belly of the whale and then
The Hebrew children from the fiery furnace so the good books do declare
Hey Lord if you can't help me for goodness sake don't help that bear

Yaah look out preacher
Well about that time the limb broke off and the preacher came tumblin' down
Had a straight razor out of his pocket by the time he lit on the ground
He landed on his feet right in front a that bear and Lord what an awful fight
The preacher and the bear and the razor and the hair flyin' from left to right

Well first they was up and then they was down
The preacher and the bear runnin' round and round
The bear he roared and the the preacher he groaned
He was havin' a tough time holdin' his own
He said Lord if I get out a here alive
To the good book I'll abide
No more huntin' on the Sabbath day
Come Sunday I'm headin' to the church to pray
Up to the heavens the preacher glanced
He said oh Lord won't you give me one more chance
Then his suspenders gave away
And he knocked that bear ten feet away
Then the preacher got up and made a bound
To the tree where he'd be safe and sound
Pulled himself up and turned about
Cast his eyes to the skies and he did shout

Hey Lord you delivered Daniel from the bottom of the lion's den..."
Jerry Reed,She Got the Goldmine (I Got the Shaft),"[Verse 1]
Well, I guess it was back in '63
When eatin' my cookin' got the better of me
So I asked this little girl I was goin' with to be my wife
Well, she said she would, so I said, ""I do""
But I'da said ""I wouldn't"" if I'da just knew
How sayin' ""I do"" was gonna screw up all of my life
Well, the first few years weren't all that bad
I'll never forget the good times we had
'Cause I'm reminded every month
When I send her the child support
Well, it wasn't too long 'til the lust all died
And I'll admit, I wasn't too surprised
The day I come home and found my suitcase sittin' out on the porch
Well, I tried to get in, she changed the lock
Then I found this note taped on the mailbox that said
""Goodbye, turkey, my attorney will be in touch,"" mhm
So I decided right then and there
I was gonna do what's right, give 'er her fair share
But brother, I didn't know her share was gonna be that much

[Chorus]
She got the goldmine (She got the goldmine)
I got the shaft (I got the shaft)
They split it right down the middle
And then they give her the better half
Well, it all sounds sorta funny
But it hurts too much to laugh
She got the goldmine, I got the shaft

[Verse 2]
Now listen, you ain't heard nothin' yet
Why, they give her the color television set
Then they give her the house
The kids and both of the cars
See?
Well, then they start talkin' about child support
Alimony, and the costs to the court
Didn't take me long to figure out how far in the toilet I was
I'm tellin' ya, they have made a mistake
'Cause it adds up to more than this cowboy makes
Besides, everything I ever had worth takin' they've already took
While she's livin' like a queen on alimony
I'm workin' two shifts, eatin' baloney
Askin' myself, ""Why didn't you just learn how to cook?""

[Chorus]
They give her the goldmine (She got the goldmine)
They give me the shaft (I got the shaft)
They said they're splittin' it all down the middle
But she got the better half
Well, it all sounds mighty funny
But it hurts too much to laugh
She got the goldmine, I got the shaft

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus]
Well, she got the goldmine (She got the goldmine)
I got the shaft (I got the shaft)
They split it all down the middle
And then they give her the better half
Well, I guess it all sounds funny (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ha-ha-ha)
But it hurts too much to laugh
She got the goldmine, I got the shaft

[Outro]
Heh, heh, they ain't kidding, I got the shaft (Ooh)
But I don't have to worry about totin' a billfold anymore (Ooh)
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
I let my wife tote it, I'm gonna be carryin' food stamps (Ooh)
You get it judge?
I'm gonna be indebted (Ooh)
That's not funny, huh?
Huh?
Contempt of court? (Ooh)
What do you mean I'm–
Listen judge, I'm just kiddin' (Ooh)
I mean, you can't get blood out of a turnip, can ya? (Ha-ha-ha)"
Jerry Reed,Pretty Mary Sunlight,"Yeah

Pretty Mary Sunlight
She's all right with me
Pretty Mary Sunlight
She's everything I need

Some people sit around
And they watch the world go by
They just don't know the fun
They're missing
People see me happy
And they sometimes ask me why
I tell them girls were made for kissing

Well, I don't need to look around
'Cause I'm in the heaven
Since I found my

Pretty Mary Sunlight
She's all right with me
Pretty Mary Sunlight
She's everything I need

Pretty Mary Sunlight
She' turns the night to day
Pretty Mary Sunlight
Don't ever go away

Some people spend their whole lives
Chasing after dreams
Dreams I guess they never will believe in
Playing foolish games
Inventing fairy tales and schemes
Building fantasies that will deceive them

But I don't need to look around
'Cause I'm in the heaven
Since I found my

Pretty Mary Sunlight
She's all right with me, song
Pretty Mary Sunlight
She's everything I need

Pretty Mary Sunlight
Turns each night to day
Pretty Mary Sunlight
Don't ever go away

Don't you ever go away, song"
Jerry Reed,The Bandit,"They call you the Bandit, an outlaw untamed
Shackled only by freedom, you wear no man's chain
Some say they despise you, well maybe they do
But deep down inside them, I bet they wish they were you

Bandit, you're reckless, and you live much too hard
Bandit, you're the joker in the deal of the cards
You're a legend to the old man, a hero to the child
Bandit, steal a lady's heart with only a smile

They call you the Bandit, they call you the Bandit
Thеy call you the Bandit, they call you the Bandit"
Jerry Reed,Patches,"I was born and raised down in Alabama
On a farm way back up in the woods
I was so ragged that folks used to call me Patches
Papa used to tease me about it
'Cause deep down inside he was hurt
'Cause he'd done all he could

My papa was a great old man
I can see him with a shovel in his hands, see
Education he never had
He did wonders when the times got bad
The little money from the crops he raised
Barely paid the bills we made

For, life had kick him down to the ground
When he tried to get up
Life would kick him back down
One day Papa called me to his dyin' bed
Put his hands on my shoulders
And in his tears he said

He said, Patches
I'm dependin' on you, son
To pull the family through
My son, it's all left up to you

Two days later Papa passed away, and
I became a man that day
So I told Mama I was gonna quit school, but
She said that was Daddy's strictest rule

So ev'ry mornin' 'fore I went to school
I fed the chickens and I chopped wood too
Sometimes I felt that I couldn't go on
I wanted to leave, just run away from home
But I would remember what my daddy said
With tears in his eyes on his dyin' bed

He said, Patches
I'm dependin' on you, son
I tried to do my best
It's up to you to do the rest

Then one day a strong rain came
And washed all the crops away
And at the age of 13 I thought
I was carryin' the weight of the
Whole world on my shoulders
And you know, Mama knew
What I was goin' through, 'cause

Ev'ry day I had to work the fields
'Cause that's the only way we got our meals
You see, I was the oldest of the family
And ev'rybody else depended on me
Ev'ry night I heard my Mama pray
Lord, give him the strength to face another day

So years have passed and all the kids are grown
The angels took Mama to a brand new home
Lord knows, people, I shedded tears
But my daddy's voice kept me through the years

Sing
Patches, I'm dependin' on you, son
To pull the family through
My son, it's all left up to you

Oh, I can still hear Papa's voice sayin'
Patches, I'm dependin' on you, son
I've tried to do my best
It's up to you to do the rest

I can still hear Papa, what he said
Patches..."
Jerry Reed,Another Puff,"I know there's a lotta talk going around today
About cigarette smoking whittling your life away
I've seen it and I've heard it so many times
That finally it just started to prey on my mind
I guess it scared me a little bit
That's why I decided I was gonna quit
So while I was sitting here forming my battle plan
I took another puff and turned on the fan
I just sat there in my easy chair
And thought of all the money I'd wasted on cigarettes all these years
I thought how I'd spend the rest of my days
After I kick this habit my body craves
Said to myself this ain't gonna be so tough
With that little bit of assurance
I took another puff

I took a puff, a puff, then I ripped off another puff
I decided I'd about had about enough
That breaking this habit won't be too tough

Now I've give a lot of thought to this thing
If I didn't smoke cigarettes I'd feel just like a king
Besides with the price going up every day
I knew I was just throwing all my good money away
You know I ain't lit one in an hour or so?
Just wanted to make sure I could quit you know
I was thinking maybe I oughta write all this down
Put it in a song kinda circulate it around
Can't ever tell it might make a hit
And that redneck Hall did a little bit
Can you imagine me a hit songwriter!
Now where's... Where'd I put that cigarette lighter?
After all it's a habit and a habit you can break
Just a little bit of willpower son that's all it takes
I said to myself you got to be tough!
And with that little bit of wisdom
I took another puff

I took a puff, and then a puff, then I finally ripped off another puff
And I decided boy this ain't gonna be tough
Besides I'd just about had enough
I'm about ready to quit this rotten habit anyway

Oh I think they ought to take it offa television
It looks too good! Ow!
I like them skinny ones with the filter
Oh give it to me! Give it to me!
Cigarettes... I say if I quit smoking what'll I do?
Maybe I'll eat
Yeah I'll eat cigarettes
Ahh, I love it I love it I love it I love it I love it I love it
Chester B don't smoke, he smokes logs!
Makes you laugh funny too
Oh my throat's scratchin', oh
I wish I could think of something bad to say about cigarettes
Boo on cigarettes, don't smoke don't smoke don't smoke
You quit smoking that'll leave more for me!
I love it I love it, no I don't love cigarettes ya know
Don't misunderstand me I hate cigarettes
Makes ya cough, and when ya don't smoke it makes ya shake
I don't know what's worse, the shake or the cough
I think I'll make me a coughshake, oh!
Son did you ever smoke?
Oh I remember one time I quit smoking
I quit for three months
My wife left me
So did my children
She took my house and left
It was a mobile home"
Jerry Reed,You Took All The Ramblin’ Out Of Me,"You took all the ramblin' outta me, girl
With the finest lovin' I ever done seen
Now all I wanna do is sit home and play my little guitar
And sing songs about all the places that I've seen, mmm

Your country lovin' and your country cookin'
Done blowed my mind and set me free
You took away all my urge to roam
All I wanna do is just hang around home
'Cause you took all the ramblin' outta me

How I wound up down here in Monroe
Is somethin' I'm never gonna figure out, it's true
But your sweet love settled me down
Made me quit all my ramblin' round
Now all I wanna do is sit home and grow old with you

Last night I heard a freight train through my window
And I couldn't help thinkin' that I heard that whistle scream
Now that old lonesome sound don't make me itch and wanna move around
Because you took all the ramblin' outta me, yeah

You took all the ramblin' outta me, girl
With the finest lovin' I ever done seen
Now all I wanna do is sit home and play my little guitar
And sing songs about all the places that I've seen, mm

Your country lovin' and your country cookin'
Done blowed my mind and set me free
You took away all my urge to roam
Now all I wanna do is just hang around home
'Cause you took all the ramblin' outta me

A-one more time, sing it son
You took all the ramblin' outta me, girl
With the finest lovin' I ever done seen
Now all I wanna do is sit home and play my little guitar
And sing songs . . "
Jerry Reed,Guitar Man,"Well, I quit my job down at the car wash
Left my mama a goodbye note
By sundown I'd left Kingston
With my guitar under my coat
I hitchhiked all the way down to Memphis
Got a room at the YMCA
For the next three weeks I went a hauntin' them nightclubs
Just lookin' for a place to play
Well, I thought my pickin' would set 'em on fire
But nobody wanted to hire a guitar man

Well, I nearly 'bout starved to death down in Memphis
I run outta money and luck
So I bummed me a ride down to Macon, Georgia
On a overloaded poultry truck
I thumbed on down to Panama City
Started checkin' out some o' them all night bars
Hopin' I could make myself a dollar
Makin' music on my guitar
I got the same old story at them all night piers
There ain't no room around here for a guitar man
We don't need a guitar man, son

So I slept in the hobo jungles
Roamed a thousand miles of track
Till I found myself in Mobile Alabama
At a club they call Big Jack's
A little four-piece band was jammin'
So I took my guitar and I sat in
I showed 'em what a band would sound like
With a swingin' little guitar man
Show 'em, son

If you ever take a trip down to the ocean
Find yourself down around Mobile
Make it on out to a club called Jack's
If you got a little time to kill
Just follow that crowd of people
You'll wind up out on his dance floor
Diggin' the finest little five-piece group
Up and down the Gulf of Mexico
Guess who's leadin' that five-piece band
Well, wouldn't ya know, it's that swingin' little guitar man"
Jerry Reed,Gator,"[Intro]
He was raised in the swamp
In back of a slough
He grew up eatin' rattlesnake meat
Drinkin' homemade brew
Now, folks here about call him Gator
And everybody knows him well
Meanest man to ever hit the swamp
Folks swear he come straight outta hell

[Verse 1]
Well, Gator McKlusky's sittin' on a stump
Hammer pulled back on a twelve-gauge pump
Watchin' that swamp lookin' out for the law
While he make the best corn liquor you ever saw
Rot gut whiskey
While he's makin' that mash, he watches, and he looks
Ol' Gator he knows that swamp like a book
Something out there movin', Gator, whadda ya see?
Ain't nothin' but the snakes and the gators and me

[Chorus]
Everything's okey dokey in the Okefenokee
That sheriff ain't snoopin' around
So cook that moonshine down till it's good and clear
Everything's okey dokey in the Okefenokee
That sheriff he'd soon mess around with the devil
Than to get his self alone messin' around in here

[Verse 2]
One day he was cookin' some mash, he was almost done
When they spotted the law and they had to run
So he headed for the swamp and they followed him in
But the law might as well been a-chasin' the wind
Look out for that snake sheriff
Well, they chased him on back through the muck and the slime
To the back of that swamp where the sun don't shine
But the law won't never catch Gator my friend
Cause he knows that swamp like the back of his hand

[Chorus]
Watch out, boys, old Smokey's in the Okefenokee
The sheriff's out there snoopin' around
So shut that business down and let's disappear
Look out, boys, old Smokey's in the Okefenokee
But that sheriff he's really gonna catch the devil
If he keeps on snoopin' around in here

[Outro]
Gator's in the swamp, Sheriff, go get him if you can
Careful, Sheriff, don't let that Gator bite you on your gonads"
Jerry Reed,Today Is Mine,"Today Is Mine
When the sun came up this morning I took the time to watch it rise
As its beauty struck the darkness from the skies
I thought how small and unimportant all my troubles seem to be
And how lucky another day belongs to me
And as the sleepy world around me woke up to greet the day
And all its silent beauty seemed to say:
So what, my friend, if all your dreams you haven't realized
Look around, you got a whole new day to try
Today is mine, today is mine, to do with what I will
Today is mine. My own special cup to fill
To die a little that I might learn to live
And take from life that I might learn to give
Today is mine
With all men I curse the present that seems void of peace of mind
And race my thoughts beyond tomorrow and vision there more peace of mind
But when I view the day around me I can see the fool I've been
For today is the only garden we can tend
Today is mine, today is mine, to do with what I will
Today is mine. My own special cup to fill
To die a little that I might learn to live
And take from life that I might learn to give
Today is mine"
Jerry Reed,A Thing Called Love,"Six foot six he stood on the ground weighed two hundred and thirty five pounds
But I saw that giant of a man brought down to his knees by love
[ ac.guitar ]
He was the kind of man that would gamble on luck
Look you in the eye and never back up
But I saw him cryin' like a little whipped pup because of love
Can't see it with your eyes hold it in your hand but like the wind that covers our land
Strong enough to rule the heart of any man this thing called love
It can lift you up it can let you down take your world turn it all around
Ever since time nothing's ever been found stronger than love
[ ac.guitar ]
Most men are like me they struggle in doubt
They trouble their minds day in and day out
Too busy with livin' to worry about a word called love
[ ac.guitar ]
But when I see a mother's tenderness as she holds her young close to her brest
Than I thank God this world's been blessed with a word called love
Can't see it with your eyes..."
Jerry Reed,Ko-Ko Joe,"(Ko-ko Joe)
(Ko-ko Joe)
(Ko-ko Joe)

Uhh!

(Ko-ko Joe)
Go ahead home
(Ko-ko Joe)
Up in Appaloosa county
There's a place called Ko-ko Ridge

Sittin' right on the bend
On the Etowah River
Where the water washed away the bridge

Cotton Mouth Country
(Ko-ko Joe)
A river rat's knee high
(Ko-ko Joe)
Way up around the back border
Lived a man
That the river folks talked about

They said you better stay away from Ko-ko Joe
'Cause he's cause he's crazy no account

(Ko-ko Joe)
Ko-ko Joe
They called him the Etowah River swamp rat
The folks despised him

(Ko-ko Joe)
Ko-ko Joe
He was an awfully peculiar man
The river was his only friend

And the folks didn't understand
The man called Ko-ko Joe
(Ko-ko Joe)
(Ko-ko Joe)

He'd eat monkey meat and mashed potatoes
He drunk a brew called Mo-jo Claw
That he beat outa roots from old dead stumps
On the banks of the Etowah

Made him walk a little funny
(Ko-ko Joe)
Made his breath smell funky
(Ko-ko Joe)
Well he never come across the river
'Cause the folks didn't like him in town

They said his hair was long
His clothes were dirty
They didn't want him hangin' around

Ko-ko Joe
They called him the Etowah River rat
The folks despised him

(Ko-ko Joe)
Ko-ko Joe
He was an awfully peculiar man
The river was his only friend

And the folks didn't understand
The man called Ko-ko Joe
(Ko-ko Joe)
(Ko-ko Joe)

Well it happened a year ago Sunday
And they still talk about it today
How the dam broke loose
On the Etowah River
Nearly washin' everybody away

The river water rising
(Ko-ko Joe)
Washin' up all the bushes
(Ko-ko Joe)
Well the headlines said
How a mother said, my son woulda lost his life
But he was pulled from the mud in the Etowah River
By the man y'all despised

(Ko-ko Joe)
Ko-ko Joe
They called him the Etowah River rat
The folks despised him

(Ko-ko Joe)
Ko-ko Joe
So be careful what you say, my friend
About folks you don't understand
Someday you might need a man like Ko-ko Joe

(Ko-ko Joe)
Go ahead home son

Ko-ko Joe
They called him the Etowah River rat
The folks despised him"
Jerry Reed,The Uptown Poker Club,"Well now Bill Jackson went to poor ol' Dub
To join the Uptown Poker Club
And he cursed the day he ever told anybody he joined
Cause his money used to go like it had wings
When he had queens somebody else had kings
And every night he'd just sit there donatin' all his coins

He said boys now I'm gonna play it right tonight
I'm gonna watch them cards and I'm gonna play 'em tight
And then when I come in there son my hand's gonna be a peach
Well he played 'em tight but after awhile
He done lost his self a considerable pile
So he got mad he stood up and he made this little speech

Now boys you see this razor well I had it sharpened just today
Now I'm comin' in here with my rules that everybody gonna follow when they play
Now you Clyde you keep your hands on top of the table when you're dealing please
Quit takin' them little wild cards and stickin' em down there between your knees
And Jesse quit makin' all them funny signs like you tryin' to tip off your hand
You better talk to me in American son American so's I can understand
And Leroy quit takin' em offa the bottom ooh that's rough
Just take five off the top then stop that's enough
Then pass me them cards son let me cut on them things every time before you deal
I like to handle them things boy I like to see
Cause I got news for you lad you ain't playin' this game accordin' that fella Hoyle there
Uh uh no tonight you're playin' this game accordin' to me

Well now a sittin' around the table in that there game
There just happened to be this ol' one-eyed man
And Bill kept watchin' him out of the corner of his eye
This old one-eyed cat he'd been dealin' kinda funny
He done took a whole bunch of big Bill's money
So Bill rose up and he looked around the room and with a sigh

He said hmm said it's an awful shame
Said there's somebody cheatin' in this here game
Said of course it ain't gonna do for me to stand up here and mention the guy
So I'll refrain from calling that party's name
But you let me catch him cheatin' just once again
And I'm gonna take my fist and I’m gonna close that other eye

Now you see this razor well I had it sharpened just today
Now I'm comin' in here with my rules that everybody must follow when they play
Now Clyde you keep them bony hands up here on top of the table when you're dealin' please
Don't go takin' them little wild aces stickin' em off down there between your knees
And Jesse cut out makin' all them monkey signs you still tryin' to tip off your hand
You better talk to me in American big AA so's I can understand
And Leroy quit takin' em off the bottom of the deck son I tell ya that's rough
This is an army game son take five then halt that's enough
Then pass me them face cards over here let me cut them things every time before you deal
Cause I like to delve in there son I got to see
Cause I got news for you boys you ain't playin this game accordin' to that fella Hoyle there
Uh uh tonight you're playin' this game accordin' to me

Now then seein' as how you all know that I didn't ride in here on a head of cabbage
Henry if you'll break out another deck of them Bicycles me and the boys will get on with the business
But keep your eye on that fella wearin' the patch he holds them cards kinda funny
Ha ha if he ain't careful somebody around this table liable to jack his jaw
Ha ha ha ah son I feel like my luck just changed"
Jerry Reed,Are You from Dixie (Cause I’m from Dixie Too),"Hello, there, stranger! how do you do?
There's something I'd like to say to you
Don't be surprised
You're recognized!
I'm no detective but I've just surmised
You're from the place where I long to be
Your smiling face seems to say to me
You're from my own land
My sunny homeland
Tell me can it be?

It was a way back in eighty nine
I crossed the old Mason Dixon line
Gee! but I've yearned
Longed to return
To all the good old pals I left behind
My home is way down in Alabam'
On a plantation near Birmingham
And one thing's certain
I'm surely flirtin'
With those southbound trains:

Are you from Dixie?
I said from Dixie!
Where the fields of cotton beckon to me
I'm glad to see you
Tell me how be you
And the friends I'm longing to see
If you're from Alabama, Tennessee or Caroline
Any place below the Mason Dixon line
Then you're from Dixie
Hurrary for Dixie!
'Cause I'm from Dixie too!"
Jerry Reed,Don’t Let The Good Life Pass You By,"Did you ever lie and listen to the rain fall did you ever own a
Homemade apple pie
Did you ever watch a child while he was praying
Friend don't let the good life pass you by

Did you ever hold a hand to stop its trembling
Did you ever watch the sun desert the sky
Did you ever hold a woman while she's sleeping
Friend don't let the good life pass you by

Man was made for loving not for buying go can't give you things we
Really need
Just look my friend there's happiness in living
Somewhere between broke and being free

Did you ever see the funny side of losin' did you ever sit right
Down and have a cry
Did you ever take the time to help your neighbor
Just don't let the good life pass you by

Man was made for loving...
Just don't let the good life pass you by"

Jerry Reed,Sugar Foot Rag,"Well, I'm gonna get out my sycamore and shine up my shoes
Meet my baby and tell her the news
I bet my bundle on a swayback nag
And I came home winner with a plenty o'swag

One foot, two foot slew foot drag
Swing your honey to the sugar foot rag
Do a little jig and a zig and a zag
And listen to the fiddles as they play that sugar foot rag

And swing up the middle with a shoofly four

Jerry Reed,Tupelo Mississippi Flash,"I'm gonna tell you a story that's all about
This job I had one time as a talent scout, hmm

I had a hard day at the office and the boss wasn't in town
The day this hired legged guitar picker just happened to come around

Well, he walks in my office with a great big grin
And folks that's where my story really begins

He said, ""Son my name is Boregard Rippy
I come to you from Tupelo Mississippi
I write songs that'll sing like a bird
I play licks on my guitar like you ain't never heard

But I'm down on my luck and things are just a little slack
I gotta quarter in my pocket and a shirt on my back
But you buy me some supper and give me a place I can sleep
He said ""I'll sing you some songs that'll rock your head to sleep
I got talent boy. Said back home they call me the Tupelo Mississippi Flash

Well I knew I was in a room with some kind of a nut
When he pulled out that pack of used cigarette butts
So that's when I told him ""We can't use you today""
So I handed the boy a dollar and sent him on his way

Well the boss got back and we both had a laugh
When I told him 'bout the Tupelo Mississippi Flash
And pretty soon I had the story circling around
About this Mississippi nut that we had in our town

I said, ""watch him everybody, the boy's squirrelly!
He walks around calling himself the Tupelo Mississippi Flash.""

Well it happened one day while I was driving to my home
I just happened to have my car radio on
When I heard the jockey raving about a brand new smash
By a kid called the Tupelo Mississippi Flash

I almost wrecked my automobile
I went through a red light
I hit the traffic cop....Why??

Well my story's got an ending and it's short and sweet
The boss man he fired me and left me out in the street
But I got a new job now and I'm as learnin' real fast
I'm drivin' the bus for the Tupelo Mississippi Flash

And his Cadillac I'm driving that for him too
And that yacht he's got
And is there a plane??
Well chauffeur, chauffeur I hear him say
Tupelo Mississippi, who ever heard of it..........."
Linda Martell,Color Him Father,"[Verse 1]
There's a man in my house, he's so big and strong
Goes to work each day and he stays all day long
Comes home each night, looking tired and beat
He sits down at the dinner table and has a bite to eat

[Verse 2]
Never a frown, always a smile
When he says to me, ""How's my child?""
I said that I've been studying hard all day in school
Trying very hard to understand the golden rule

[Chorus]
I think I'll color him father
I think I'll color him love
I'm gonna color him father
I think I'll color him love

[Verse 3]
He says education is a thing to complete
Because without it, life just ain't very sweet
I love this man and I don't know why
Except I'll need his strength until the day I die

[Chorus]
I think I'll color him father
I'm gonna color him love
I've got to color him father
I think I'll color him love

[Verse 4]
Our real old man, he got killed in the war
Mom and seven kids couldn't have gotten very far
She said to God she could never love again
And then, there he stood, with that big wide grin

[Bridge]
He married my mother, he took us in
And now we belong to the man with that big wide grin

[Chorus]
I've got to color him father
I'm gonna color him love
I've got to color him father
Believe I'll color him love"
Linda Martell,Bad Case of the Blues (Remastered 2022),"[Verse 1]
Livin' and workin' in the city, I thought I was a big girl
Oh, I felt so smart, and my whole life I could choose
So then smarty found herself a city guy who one night said he loves her
And the next night he leaves her sittin' with a bad case of the blues

[Chorus]
Yo-de-lay-dee-hee-hee-hee-hee, ha-a-ha
If I really was a smart girl, I could turn him loose
Yo-de-lay-dee-hee-hee-hee-hee, ha-a-ha
Instead of sittin' and cryin' with a bad case of the blues

[Verse 2]
I took myself out to the country to see my mother
She said, ""What no-good man has got my lovin' little child’s heart sore""
I said, ""Momma, he tells me that he loves me, and then he's out with another
And he's got me right down to the last square on the checkerboard""

[Chorus]
Yo-de-lay-dee-hee-hee-hee-hee, ha-a-ha
Little country girl's done got hooked on a barbed wire love

And she can't get loose from this bad case of the blues
And she can't get loose from this bad case of the blues"
Linda Martell,I Almost Called Your Name (Remastered 2022),"[Verse]
We were dancing, and he led just like you used to
He squeezed my hand and teased me, just like you used to
And so close to my lips the words came
That I almost called your name

[Chorus]
I almost called your name
In so many ways, you both are the same
The only difference in the two is that I, I still love you
Yes, I kissed him, but I almost called your name
I almost called your name
In so many ways, you both are the same
The only difference in the two is that I, I still love you
Yes, I kissed him, but I almost called your name

Linda Martell,Old Letter Song (Remastered 2022),"[Pre-Chorus]
I heard a corny old letter song on the radio a while back
I hadn't heard one in so long, I wanted to laugh
You know the kind of song I mean
Where they take a word like mother
And say, ""M is for the many things she did""
And I thought to myself, ""Oh brother""
Well this one was about home
And I listened while the sad boys sang this song:

[Chorus]
""H is for humble, for that's the kind of home
Where you learn to love one another
And lovin' makes you strong
O is for one and only
For that's the only one you'll ever know
For you have one father and one mother
That kiss away your tears when day is gone
M is for the memories
That will make you hold fast to the right
No matter how many wise guys try to line you up for a trip outta sight
And E is for everything for really that is what home is
No matter if you're the father, the mother, or the kid""

[Post-Chrous]
I was holdin' back the teardrops
When the record stopped
And the last laugh was on me, for you see
It had turned back the clock
And mama was rocking me to sleep again
While daddy mowed the lawn
And it sounded very much like this old letter song"
Linda Martell,Color Him Father (Remastered 2022),"[Verse 1]
There's a man in my house, he's so big and strong
Goes to work each day and he stays all day long
Comes home each night, looking tired and beat
He sits down at the dinner table and has a bite to eat

[Verse 2]
Never a frown, always a smile
When he says to me, ""How's my child?""
I said that I've been studying hard all day in school
Trying very hard to understand the golden rule

[Chorus]
I think I'll color him father
I think I'll color him love
I'm gonna color him father
I think I'll color him love

[Verse 3]
He says education is a thing to complete
Because without it, life just ain't very sweet
I lovе this man and I don't know why
Except I'll need his strength until the day I diе

I think I'll color him father
I'm gonna color him love
I've got to color him father

Linda Martell,Tender Leaves of Love (Remastered 2022),"[Verse 1]
Not long ago, our love was like a young and tender vine
That grew and grew until our hearts were so entwined
But carelessly, you soon forgot the vine was growing there
And its tender leaves began to die for want of care

[Chorus]
Now the tender leaves of love are blowing in the wind
The dust of loneliness covers them
How sad it is to know we'll never love again
For our tender leaves of love are now blowing in the wind

[Verse 2]
How often since, I've wished the vine was green again
Young and tender, sweet surrender were mine again
But as I remember, a gray December descends again
And our tender leaves of love just die in a winter wind

[Chorus]
Now the tender leaves of love are blowing in the wind
The dust of loneliness covers them
How sad it is to know we'll never love again
For our tender leaves of love are now blowing in the wind"
Linda Martell,Before the Next Teardrop Falls,"[Verse 1]
If she brings you happiness
Then I wish you both the best
It's your happiness that matters most of all
But if she ever breaks your heart
If the teardrops ever start
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls

[Verse 2]
Oh, though it hurts to let you go
Darlin', I want you to know
That I'll stand by you if you ever call
And if I should ever hear
That she's made you shed a tear
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls

[Bridge]
I'll be there anytime you need me by your side
To dry away every teardrop that you cried

[Verse 3]
Oh, if she ever leaves you blue
Just remember, I love you
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls
Oh, I'll be there before the next teardrop falls"
Linda Martell,San Francisco is a Lonely Town (Remastered 2022),"[Verse 1]
Two happy people on a Greyhound bus
We came here looking for a life for us
But the nightlife is his new life, and the only thing I've found
Is San Francisco is a lonely town

[Verse 2]
Oh, there were good times for a little while
But now his new friends see I cramp his style
I guess I'm in the way now, he don't need me hangin' round
Oh, San Francisco is a lonely town

[Verse 3]
Now he's about somewhere cross San Francisco bay
He'll be wondering where I am when he gets in today
And then he'll notice all my things are gone
And while he stands there in that room alone
Why this Greyhound keeps on rolling, I pray the Lord he's found
San Francisco is a lonely town"

Linda Martell,The Wedding Cake (Remastered 2022),"[Verse 1]
Don't be troubled 'bout me 'cause I'm tired
From working 'round the house when day is done
Don't think you've failed me 'cause you can't afford that dishwasher to make my life more fun
You know the measure of a man is much more than just the money he can make
And every woman knows a lot of joy and tears come with the wedding cake

[Verse 2]
The wedding cake is not all icing and loving tender whispers in the dark
One slice is concern for your dreams, 'fraid they won’t come true and break your heart
Another slice is feeding kids and wiping noses, crying when the doorbell rings and there are roses
Every woman knows a lot of give and take comes with the wedding cake

[Verse 3]
It's facing shadows of the future, praying they will fall away
As we walk toward them, searching for the sun
And it's long and anxious hours with the wolf at the door
Hugs and kisses when at last we see the dawn
So when the hands of time trace tawny lines upon our face and lace our hair with strands of gray
We'll laugh and say for all who will partake, it all comes with the wedding cake
Yes, for all who will partake, it all comes with the wedding cake
Oh yes, for all who will partake, it all comes with the wedding cake"
Linda Martell,"You’re Crying Boy, Crying (Remastered 2022)","[Verse 1]
With me, you had it made in the shade
But you walked right out on your way
Someday you're gonna faint like a little boy
You done hurt the only one who can bring you joy

[Chorus]
You'll be crying boy, cryin' a little bit every day
Wiltin' on the vine, boy, you'll just fade away
You're crying boy, crying when I don't come around
Without my lovin' then you'll be just like dirt on the ground

[Verse 2]
You're like a little flower got no sun
I was your sunshine once, now that's done
Someday, you'll wake up, tears and pain
Realize that I'm gone, cry in pain

[Chorus]
You'll be cryin' boy, cryin' a little bit every day
Oh, wiltin' on the vine, boy, you'll just fade away
You're cryin' boy, crying when I don't come around
Without my lovin' then you'll be just like dirt on the ground

And like a mousetrap, your little mind's gon' snap
And baby divine, you're gonna find that

[Verse 3]
Someday you'll awake to tears and pain
Realize that I'm gone, cry in pain
I won't come to your call, I won't play
You done threw the best thing in your life away

You'll be cryin' boy, cryin' a little bit every day

Linda Martell,There Never Was a Time (Remastered 2022),"[Verse 1]
There was a time we'd sit in the backyard
'Cause the house would get so hot
From the summer sun, there was no way of sleepin'
And you'd play your old guitar
We'd fight mosquitos and enjoy
Your backyard concerts for we had no television
We'd just begun our life as man and wife, and hardships then
Could scarcely scare us into quittin'
Things were far from bein' fine
We often dined upon a dime
But there never was a time we didn't love

[Verse 2]
And that Christmas brought our saddest day
Whеn your pride gave way and you told the kids
Thеre'd be no gifts 'cause we were broke
And though their little tears of grief
Was so hard to see it didn't hurt me
Like the lump I knew was in your throat
It was then with arms entwined we both broke down and cried
For it seemed like nothing good would ever come
The doctor bills we couldn't pay
They came and took our car away
But there never was a time we didn't love

[Verse 3]
Now there's an easy chair for my back, a satin pillow for my head
And the kids are wild about their brand-new cars
Dad and I can order steaks with all the trimmings and not worry
If we spend a dollar more than we can spare
No wonder in our prayers we thank the man upstairs who led us through
The years of rearin' kids and payin' bills
And I think he guided us, not because we were smart
But just because there never was a time we didn't love
Oh, there never was a time
There never was a time
There never was a time we didn't love"

When I try to go to sleep
And know that I won't lie awake and cry
Then I'll be over you
When I wake up in the morning
And I find that you're not on my mind
Then I'll be over you

[Verse 1]
If the time should arrive

When each beat of my heart says it's time to start giving in
When I close my eyes in someone's warm embrace
And I don't see your face

Anyway, my eyes are not accustomed to this light
And my shoes are not accustomed to this hard concrete
So I must go back to my room and make my day complete

Statler Brothers,Bed of Rose’s,"[Verse 1]
She was called a scarlet woman by the people
Who would go to church but left me in the streets
With no parents of my own, I never had a home
And an eighteen-year-old boy has got to eat

[Verse 2]
She found me outside one Sunday morning
Begging money from a man I didn't know
She took me in and wiped away my childhood
A woman of the streets this lady Rose

[Chorus]
This bed of Rose's that I lay on
Where I was taught to be a man
This bed of Rose's where I'm living
Is the only kind of life I'll understand

[Verse 3]
She was a handsome woman just thirty-five
Who was spoken to in town by very few
She managed a late evening business
Like most of the town wished they could do

[Verse 4]
And I learned all the things that a man should know
From a woman not approved of, I suppose
But she died knowing that I really loved her
Of life's bramble bush I picked a rose

[Chorus]
This bed of Rose's that I lay on
Where I was taught to be a man
This bed of Rose's where I'm living
Is the only kind of life I'll understand

This bed of Rose's that I lay on
Where I was taught to be a man
This bed of Rose's where I'm living
Is the only kind of life I'll understand, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh"
Statler Brothers,New York City,"[Verse 1]
She came to me shortly after Christmas
Said she hated spoiling New Year's Eve
But the truth doesn't wait to come in season
And what we had feared was now believed
She said she'd leave come Monday morning
Catch a plane if I'd split the fare
She had friends who lived in New York City (New York City)
She'd look them up and have the baby there

[Chorus]
And now she's alone in New York City (New York City)
Living like... Lord, I wonder how
An angel in hell in New York City (New York City)
But I can't think about that now

[Verse 2]
Honey, will you tell him Bible stories
And give him all the love I never could?
And never tell him too much 'bout his daddy
'Cause there's not too much to say that's good
He'll have to learn it all from his mother:
How to count and say his A-B-C's
But when you teach him prayers to say at bedtime (New York City)
Leave off ""God bless Daddy,"" won't you please?

[Chorus]
And now they're alone in New York City (New York City)
Living like... Lord, I wonder how
Two angels in hell in New York City (New York City)
But I can't think about that now
I can't think about that now"
Statler Brothers,The Fourth Man,"Here is a story
From the good book we know
A story 'bout a miracle
That happened long ago

We hope that you'll take courage
When temptation you meet
There's somebody watching you
Who's strong when you're weak

They wouldn't bend
They held on to the will of God so we are told
They wouldn't bow
They would not bow their knee to the idol made of gold
They wouldn't burn
They were protected by the fourth man in the fire
They wouldn't bend
They wouldn't bow, they wouldn't burn

Now the prophet Danial tells about
Three men who walked with God
Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego
Before the wicked king they stood

And the king demanded them
Bound and thrown
In the firey furnace that day
But the fire was so hot
That the men were slain
Who forced them on their way

Now when the few were thrown in
And the king rose up
To witness this awful fate
He began to tremble at what he saw
And in astonished tones he spake

Did we not cast three men bound
Into the midst of that fire
Well though I see four men unhurt
Unbound and walking down there

There's Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego
An' the fiery coals they trod
And the form of the fourth man
That I see is like the Son of God

They wouldn't bend
They held on to the will of God so we are told
They wouldn't bow
They would not bow their knee to the idol made of gold
They wouldn't burn
They were protected by the fourth man in the fire
They wouldn't bend
They wouldn't bow, they wouldn't burn

They wouldn't bend
They held on to the will of God so we are told
They wouldn't bow
They would not bow their knee to the idol made of gold
They wouldn't burn
They were protected by the fourth man in the fire
They wouldn't bend
They wouldn't bow, they wouldn't burn

They wouldn't bend
They held on to the will of God so we are told
They wouldn't bow
They would not bow their knee to the idol made of gold
They wouldn't burn
They were protected by the fourth man in the fire
They wouldn't bend
They wouldn't bow, they wouldn't burn"

Statler Brothers,You Can’t Have Your Kate and Edith Too,"[Verse 1]
We went out on a double date
Me and Edith, you and Kate
Before we got past their front gate
There you were making eyes at Edith
While you were making time with Kate

[Refrain]
You can't have your Kate and Edith too
You rascal you, yodel-a-dio

[Verse 2]
Then we went to a drive in a show
You were kissing on Kate, she wouldn't let you go

I found your big hairy hand holding on
To the hand I was trying to hold

You can't have your Kate and Edith too
You rascal you, yodel-a-dio

Get her some popcorn, I said I would

Hadn't crawled into the backseat with
Edith and Kate was back there too

You rascal you, yodel-a-dio

And you and Edith are in the house alone

Well, I ain't a-gonna need this house no longer
Ain't a-gonna need this house no more
Ain't got time to fix the shingles
Ain't got time to fix the floor
Ain't got time to oil the hinges
Nor to mingle the window panes
Ain't a-gonna need this house no longer
I'm a-gettin' ready to meet the saints

[Verse 1]
Well, this ole house once knew my children
This house once knew my wife
This ole house was home and comfort
As we fought the storms of life
This ole house once rang with laughter
This ole house heard many shouts
But now trembles in the darkness
When the lightnin' walks about

Ain't a-gonna need this house no longer
Ain't a-gonna need this house no more

Ain't got time to oil the hinges
Nor to mingle the window panes
Ain't a-gonna need this house no longer
I'm a-gettin' ready to meet the saints

[Verse 2]
Now my old hound dog lies a-sleepin'
He don't know I'm gonna leave
Else he'd wake up by the fireplace
And he'd howl and moan and grieve
But my huntin' days are over
Ain't a-gonna hunt the coon no more
Gabriel just brought in my chariot
When the wind blew down the door

Ain't a-gonna need this house no longer
Ain't a-gonna need this house no more
Ain't got time to fix the shingles
Ain't got time to fix the floor

Statler Brothers,Noah Found Grace in the Eyes of the Lord,"Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord
Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord
That is the reason the Scriptures record
Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord
Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord

Well the Lord looked down from His window in the sky and said
I created man but I don't remember why
Nothin' but fightin' since creation day
I'll send a little water and I'll wash'em all away
So the Lord came down to look around a spell
And there He found Noah behavin' mighty well
And that is the reason the Scriptures record
Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord

Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord
Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord
That is the reason the Scriptures record
Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord
Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord

The Lord said Noah there's gonna' be a flood
And there's gonna be some water and there's gonna be some mud
Take off your hat Noah and take off your coat
Get Ham, Shem and Japath, and build yourself a boat

Noah said Lord I don't believe I could
The lord said Noah get some sturdy gopher wood
Ya never know what you can do till you try
Build it 50 cubits wide and 30 cubits high

Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord
Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord
That is the reason the Scriptures record
Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord
Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord

Noah said there it is, there it is Lord
The Lord said Noah it's time to get aboard
Now take a creature a he and a she
And of course Mrs. Noah and the whole family

Noah said Lord it's gettin' mighty dark
The Lord said Noah get these creatures in the ark
Noah said Lord it's beginin' to pour
The Lord said Noah hurry up and shut the door

Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord
Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord
That is the reason the Scriptures record
Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord
Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord

Well the ark rose up on the foot of the deep
And after 40 days Mr.Noah took a peek said
We ain't movin' Lord where are we at
The Lord said you're sittin' on a mountain Ararat

Noah said Lord it's gettin' mighty dry
The Lord said Noah see My rainbow in the sky
Take all the creatures and people to earth
And don't be more trouble than you're worth

Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord
Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord
Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord
And he landed high and dry
And he landed high and dry
And he landed high and dry"
Statler Brothers,The Other Side of the Cross,"There were tears in the eyes of Jesus there were nails in the palms of his hands
There were thorns in his brow and only God could know how
Much pain he could withstand
There was blood all around the hillside as a mother mourned her loss
And we all stood to gain from the heavenly pain on the other side of the cross
On the other side of the cross the side that no one could see
On the spirit of things yet to come on the future of you and me
And what he gave that day on the cross not one bit of love has been lost
Hold my hand stand up and say if you were there on that day
On the other side of the cross..."
Statler Brothers,Elizabeth,"Oh Elizabeth, I want to see your pretty face
I want to touch your lips
I want to feel your warm embrace
Don't know if I could ever live my life without you
Oh Elizabeth, I'm sure missing you

I remember when we shared a life together
You gave me strength and love
With life that felt brand new
When you're so far away
I'd have to say I'm feeling blue
Oh Elizabeth, I'm sure missing you

Oh Elizabeth, I long to see your pretty face
I long to touch your lips
I long to feel your warm embrace
Don't know if I could ever live my life without you
Oh Elizabeth, I'm sure missing you

Well it's been said before
That I've caused many heartaches
And I wonder if that was really true
Being all alone feels my heart would surely break
Oh Elizabeth, I hope you understand

Oh Elizabeth, I want to see your pretty face
I want to touch your lips
I want to feel your warm embrace
Don't know if I could ever live my life without you
Oh Elizabeth, I'm sure missing you

Don't know if I could ever live my life without you
Oh Elizabeth, I'm sure missing you

Statler Brothers,Whatever Happened To Randolph Scott,"[Verse 1]
Everybody knows when you go to the show you can't take the kids along
You've gotta read the paper and know the code of GPG and R and X
And you gotta know what the movie's about before you even go
Tex Ritter's gone and Disney's dead and the screen is filled with sex

[Chorus]
Whatever happened to Randolph Scott ridin' the trail alone?
Whatever happened to Gene and Tex and Roy and Rex, the Durango Kid?
Oh, whatever happened to Randolph Scott, his horse plain as could be?
Whatever happened to Randolph Scott has happened to the best of me

[Verse 2]
Everybody's tryin' to make a comment about our doubts and fears
True Grit's the only movie I've really understood in years
You've gotta take your analyst along to see if it's fit to see
Whatever happened to Randolph Scott has happened to the industry

[Chorus]
Whatever happened to Johnny Mack Brown and Allan ""Rocky"" Lane?
Whatever happened to Lash LaRue? I'd love to see them again
Whatever happened to Smiley Burnette, Tim Holt and Gene Autry
Whatever happened to all of these has happened to the best of me

[Outro]
Whatever happened to Randolph Scott has happened to the industry"
Statler Brothers,Do You Remember These,"Saturday morning serials chapters 1 through 15
Fly paper, penny loafers, Lucky Strike Green
Flat tops, sock hops, Studebaker, Pepsi please
Ah, do you remember these?

Cigar bands on your hand, your daddy's socks rolled down
Sticks, no plugs and aviator caps with flaps that button down
Movie stars on Dixie Cup tops and knickers to your knees
Ah, do you remember these?

The hit parade, grape Tru-Aid, the Sadie Hawkins dance
Pedal pushers, duck tail hair, and peggin' your pants
Howdy-Doody, Tutti-Frutti, the seam up the back of her hose
Ah, do you remember those?

James Dean, he was keen, Sunday movies were taboo
The senior prom, Judy's mom, rock and roll was new
Cracker Jack prize, stars in your eyes, ask daddy for the keys
Ah, do you remember these?

The bogeyman, lemonade stand, and takin' your tonsils out
Indian burn and wait your turn and four foul balls you're out
Cigarette loads and secret codes and savin' lucky stars
Can you remember back that far?

To boat neck shirts and fender skirts and crinoline petticoats
Mum's the word and a dirty bird and a double root beer float
Moon hub caps and loud heel taps and he's a real gone cat
Ah, do you remember that?

Dancin' close, little moron jokes, and cooties in her hair
Captain Midnight, Ovaltine, and The Whip at the County Fair
Charles Atlas Course, Roy Roger's Horse, and only The Shadow knows
Ah, do you remember those?

Gable's charm, Frog in your arm, loud mufflers, pitchin' woo
Going steady, Veronica and Betty, white bucks, and Blue Suede Shoes
Knock Knock jokes: Who's there? Dewey. Dewey who?
Do we remember these? Yes we do. Ah, do we, do we remember these"
Statler Brothers,More Than a Name on a Wall,"I saw her from a distance
As she walked up to the wall
In her hand she held some flowers
As her tears began to fall
And she took out pen and paper
As to trace her memories
And she looked up to heaven
And the words she said were these...

She said Lord my boy was special
And he meant so much to me
And Oh I'd love to see him
Just one more time you see
All I have are the memories
And the moments to recall

So Lord could you tell him
He's more than a name on a wall..

She said he really missed the family
And being home on Christmas day
And he died for God and Country
In a place so far away

I remember just a little boy
Playing war since he was three
But Lord this time I know
He's not coming home to me

And she said Lord my boy was special
And he meant so much to me
And Oh I'd love to see him
But I know it just can't be
So I thank you for my memories
And the moments to recall

But Lord could you tell him
He's more than a name on a wall..

Lord could you tell him
He's more than a name on a wall.."
Statler Brothers,I Believe in Santa’s Cause,"Never heard a snowman talking
Never seen a reindeer fly
Nor seen a wooden soldier walking
Nor met Santa eye to eye

Now there are those who don't believe
In miracles or Santa Claus
But I believe what I believe
And I believe in Santa's cause

Never heard an angel singing
Never known a Scrooge to smile
But I have heard sleigh bells ring
And light a spark in some small child

For kids and tress light up at Christmas
As well as preachers and our lawns
And light a Santa way at Christmas
I believe in Santa's cause

There's a Santa world at Christmas
Turning to the world's applause
So hang a bell for ole Saint Nick
'Cause I believe in Santa's cause

Now there are those who don't believe
In miracles or Santa Claus
But I believe what I believe
And I believe in Santa's cause"
Statler Brothers,Just A Little Talk With Jesus,"I once was lost in sin but Jesus took me in
And then a little light from Heaven filled my soul
He bathed my heart in love and wrote my name above
And just a little talk with Jesus made me whole

Now let us have a little talk with Jesus
Let us tell Him all about our troubles
He will hear our faintest cry and we will answer by and by
Now when you feel a little prayer wheel turning
You'll know a little fire is burning
You will find a little talk with Jesus makes it right

I may have doubts and fears my eyes be filled with tears
But Jesus is a friend who watches day and night
Oh, I go to Him in prayer, He knows my every care
And just a little talk with Jesus gonna makes it right

Now let us have a little talk with Jesus

And the rumors are running wild

From down in Nazareth, now listen close
She's gonna marry a man named Joseph
But the baby's father is The Holy Ghost

And who do you think could believe such a thing
Could believe that the story is true
And who do you think could believe such a thing
Well, here's hopin' to Heaven you do

Now there sayin' she had a baby
In a barn in Bethlehem
And the stars moved 'round the Heavens
Till it stopped right over them

Then some shepherds said
An Angel came and told them 'bout the birth
They always knew, men went to Heaven
But now God had come to Earth

And who do you think could believe such a thing
Could believe that the story is true
And who do you think could believe such a thing
Well, here's hopin' to Heaven you do"

Statler Brothers,Don’t Wait On Me,"When the sun wakes up in the west

When they put a dome on Wrigley Field
I'll be comin' home to you

When the cabbie don't want a bigger tip
I'll be slidin' home from first

Statler Brothers,The Junkie’s Prayer,"That bed that I lay on is narrow and cold
This sickness inside me tears at my soul
And the devil awaits me, he calls me his son
For he knows I'm cornered and too weak to run

For I soon must return to my gutter of thrills
Where joy is the needle or a bottle of pills
Where a man welcomes misery like an old friend from home
That he uses and abuses till the misery is gone

My mind's filled with torture my body's in pain
But the needle is warm as it sinks in my vein
Just a matter of seconds then my mind will be free
From the coldness and darkness that dominate me

But the freedom is short lived and then I'm alone
I must find the pusher but my money's all gone
Then the cycle of horror starts over once more
Oh God let me suffer this misery no more..."
Statler Brothers,Lord Is It I?,"Even as greatest He was
There we those who wanted to kill Him
And He knew it and told His disciples
That He was going to be betrayed by one of the twelve

Lord, is it I, is it I?

They all sat down to share in a little room upstairs
The feast of the unleavened bread
Verily I say, one of you will betray
And the friends of Jesus answered and said

Lord, is it I? They all began to cry
Lord, is it I, is it I?
Will one of us betray, kiss and run away
Lord, is it I, is it I?

This bread is My body, this cup is My blood
This do in remembrance of Me
But after I go before the cock crows
Someone will deny knowing Me

Lord, is it I? They all began to cry
Lord, is it I, is it I?
Will one be ashamed to mention Your sweet name
Lord, is it I, is it I?
Lord, is it I, is it I?"

In the soul cleansing blood of the Lamb
Are your garments spotless, are they white as snow?

And be washed in the blood of the Lamb

Statler Brothers,Here We Are Again,"Well, here we are again
The same old shape we're in
Are we in love again?
Or have we always been?

Did we learn nothing new
From all that we went through?
Or was is worth the same
To do again?

Did you find someone who
Made you forget the past?
Or anything you thought
Might have a chance to last?

So here we are again
Ain't we a sight again
Is this a dream we're in?
Or is it love?

Did you find someone who
Made you forget the past?

Well, here we are again"
Statler Brothers,Grandma,"The day Grandaddy died, she was there by his side
And she held to his hand, till the end
And just before his final breath, the one that took him into death
A smile and tear showed through, like she already knew

And in a voice so low and mild
She stayed and talked a while
Like a friend home form a long long trip
Like a mother to a child

Whenever Grandma got blue, like only widows do
She'd go to their bedroom, and close the door
And for years we thought she prayed, by the bed where he had laid
But we only could assume, what went on in Grandma's room

And in a voice so low and mild
She stayed and talked a while
Like a friend home from a long long trip
Like a mother to a child

She knew a week before the old barn burned down
And she knew before we told her, when Jack had that wreck in town
And the night before ant Julia passed away, she went over there and stayed
And I finally asked her just how she could know all this
And she just patted my hand and gave me a kiss

And in a voice so low and mild
She said I talked with Jim a while
Like a friend home form a long long trip
Like a mother to a child

Like a friend home from a long long trip
Like a mother to a child"
Clint Black,When I Said I Do,"[Verse 1: Clint Black]
These times are trouble
And these times are good
They're always gonna be
They rise and they fall
We take 'em all the way that we should
Together, you and me
Forsaking them all
Deep in the night
And by the light of day
It always looks the same
True love always does
Here by your side or a million miles away
Nothin' is ever gonna change the way I feel
The way it is, is the way that it was

[Chorus: Clint Black & Lisa Hartman Black]
When I said ""I do,"" I meant that I will
'Til the end of all time
Be faithful and true, devoted to you
That's what I had in mind when I said ""I do""

[Verse 2: Clint Black, Both & Lisa Hartman Black]
Well this whole world keeps changin'
And the world stays the same
For all who came before
And it goes hand in hand
Only you and I can undo
All that we became
That makes us so much more (So much more)
Than a woman and a man
After everything
That comes and goes around
Has only passed us by
Here alone in our dreams
I know there's a lonely heart
In every lost and found
But, forever, you and I will be the ones
Who found out what forever means

[Chorus: Clint Black & Lisa Hartman Black]
When I said ""I do,"" I meant that I will
'Til the end of all time
Be faithful and true, devoted to you
That's what I had in mind when I said, ""I do""

Truer than true
You know that I'll always be there for you
That's what I had in mind
That's what I had in mind
When I said ""I do"""
Clint Black,Like The Rain,"[Verse 1]
I never liked the rain until I walked through it with you
Every thundercloud that came was one more I might not get through
But on the darkest day, there's always light, and now I see it too
But I never liked the rain until I walked through it with you

[Verse 2]
I hear it fallin' in the night and fillin' up my mind
All the heaven's rivers come to light, I see it all unwind
I hear it talkin' through the trees and on the window pane
When I hear it I just can't believe, I never liked the rain

[Chorus]
(Like the rain)
I have fallen for you and I know just why, you
(Like the rain)
Always callin' for you, I'm fallin' for you now
Just like the rain

[Verse 2]
When the cloud is rollin' over, thunder's strikin' me
It's as bright as lightning and I wonder why I couldn't see
That it's always good and when the flood is gone we still remain
Guess I've known all along I just belong here with you, fallin'

[Chorus]
(Like the rain)
I have fallen for you and I know just why, you
(Like the rain)
Always callin' for you, I'm fallin' for you now
Just like the rain
(Like the rain)
I have fallen for you and I know just why, you
(Like the rain)
Always callin' for you, I'm fallin' for you now
Just like the rain

[Bridge]
And when the night falls on our better days, and we're lookin' to the sky
For the winds to take us high above the plains
I know that we'll find better ways, to look into the eye
Of the storms that will be callin', forever we'll be fallin'

[Chorus]
(Like the rain)
I have fallen for you and I know just why, you
(Like the rain)
Always callin' for you, I'm fallin' for you now
Just like the rain
(Like the rain)
I have fallen for you and I know just why, you
(Like the rain)
Always callin' for you, I'm fallin' for you now
Just like the rain

[Outro]
(Like the rain)
(Like the rain)
(Like the rain)
(Like the rain)
(Like the rain)
(Like the rain)
(Like the rain)"
Clint Black,Killin’ Time,"[Verse 1]
You were the first thing that I thought of
When I thought I drank you off my mind
When I get lost in the liquor
You're the only one I find
And if I did the things I oughta
You still would not be mine
So I'll keep a tight grip on the bottle
Gettin' loose and killin' time

[Chorus]
This killin' time is killin' me
Drinkin' myself blind, thinkin' I won't see
That if I cross that line and they bury me
Well, I just might find I'll be killin' time for eternity

[Verse 2]
I don't know nothin' 'bout tomorrow
I've been lost in yesterday
I've spent all my life just dyin' for
A love that passed away
There's an end to all my sorrow
This is the only price I'll pay
I'll be a happy man when I go
And I can't wait another day

[Chorus]
This killin' time is killin' me
Drinkin' myself blind, thinkin' I won't see
That if I cross that line and they bury me
Well, I just might find I'll be killin' time for eternity

[Outro]
Yes, I just might find I'll be killin' time for eternity"
Clint Black,A Good Run Of Bad Luck,"[Verse 1]
A high roller even when the chips are down
To win her over, I'd seen the tables turn around
She's ten the hard way, I can feel it in my bones
She'll be makin' my day and not another night alone

[Pre-Chorus]
'Til it's time for a windfall and not a single minute too soon
I've been too long overdue, now I'm gonna shoot the moon

[Chorus]
I'd bet it all on a good run of bad luck
Seven come eleven and she could be mine
Luck be a lady, and I'm gonna find love
Comin' on the bottom line

[Verse 2]
I've been to the table, and I've lost it all before
I'm willin' and able, always comin' back for more
Squeezin' out a thin dime 'til there's no one hanging on my arm
I've gambled on a third time, a fool will tell you it's a charm

[Pre-Chorus]
If I'm bettin' on a loser, I'm gonna have a devil to pay
But it's the only game I know to play, it doesn't matter anyway

[Chorus]
I'd bet it all on a good run of bad luck
Seven come eleven and she could be mine
Luck be a lady, and I'm gonna find love
Comin' on the bottom line
Bet it all on a good run of bad luck
Seven come eleven and she could be mine
Luck be a lady, and I'm gonna find love
Comin' on the bottom line"
Clint Black,A Bad Goodbye,"[Verse 1: Clint Black]
I've been bound to leave you
We've known that for a while
I'm sure it's something I can't do
If I can't leave you with a smile

[Verse 2: Clint Black]
I don't know how far I'll have to go
'Til I'm sure those eyes won't cry
And in my mind I've left enough to know
That I can't leave you with a bad goodbye

[Chorus: Wynonna]
Goodbye, easier said than done
Goodbye, there's no good when you're the one
Whose goodbye you swore would never come
And in my goodbye you're finding none

[Verse 3: Clint Black]
I'm still bound to leave you
I surely don't know how
My heart won't let me put you through
What my mind said should happen now

[Verse 4: Clint Black & Wynonna, Clint Black]
I don't know where we'll go from here
There may be no way to fly
And the cloud I'm in just makes it all too clear
That I can't leave you with a bad goodbye

[Chorus: Clint Black & Wynonna]
Goodbye, easier said than done
Goodbye, there's no good when you're the one
Whose goodbye you swore would never come
And in my goodbye you're finding none

[Verse 5: Clint Black & Wynonna, Clint Black]
How can we be so far between
Where we are and one more try
And any way I look I've only seen
That I can't leave you with a bad goodbye"
Clint Black,Nothin’ But The Taillights,"[Verse 1]
Blue Kentucky highway
Headin' for the line
She hadn't said a word all night but the wheels are turnin' in her mind
Now I was ridin' shotgun
And I knew things had gone awry
Just as soon as she dropped me off at the side of the road
And she let that gravel fly

[Chorus]
Now I'm walkin' in the moonlight
Seein' nothin' but the taillights
And that's a pair of taillights I may never see again
She hit me with the left and right
Showin' me nothin' but the taillights
And that's about as lonely as the highway's ever been
Back here with my thumb out in the wind

[Verse 2]
Was it somethin' that I did to her
Or the things I never said
I wonder if the way we were
Was only in my head
Now if I even make it back to town
Before the sun comes up
I'm gonna hit every parkin' spot around
'Til I find that pick-up truck

[Chorus]
Now I'm talkin' in the moonlight
Seein' nothin' but the taillights
And that's a pair of taillights I may never see again
She hit me with the left and right
Showin' me nothin' but the taillights
And that's about as lonely as a highway's ever been
Stuck here with my thumb out in the wind

[Bridge]
Well I'll bet right now she's laughin' at how
She brought me to my knees
But she won't be laughin' half as loud
When she gives me back my keys

[Chorus]
She'll be walkin' in the moonlight
Seein' nothin' but the taillights
And that's a pair of taillights she won't ever see again
She hit me with a left and right
And with nothin' but the taillights
And I know that's about as lonely as a highway's ever been
Back here with my thumb out in the wind

[Outro]
There she goes
And here I come
Leave me out there in the middle of nowhere
Drive this"
Clint Black,Something That We Do,"[Verse 1]
I remember well the day we wed
I can see that picture in my head
I still believe the words we said
Forever will ring true
Love is certain, love is kind
Love is yours and love is mine
But it isn't somethin' that we find
It's somethin' that we do

[Verse 2]
It's holding tight, It's lettin' go
It's flyin' high and layin' low
It lets your strongest feelin's show
And your weakness too
It's a little and a lot to ask
An endless and a welcome task
Love isn't somethin' that we have
It's somethin' that we do

[Chorus]
We help to make each other all that we can be
Though we can find our strength and inspiration, independently
The way we work together is what sets our love apart
So closely that we can't tell where I end and where you start

[Verse 3]
It gives me heart remembering how
We started with a simple vow
There's so much to look back on now
Still it feels brand new
We're on a road that has no end
And each day we begin again
Love's not just somethin' that we're in
It's somethin' that we do

[Chorus]
We help to make each other all that we can be
We can find our strength and inspiration, independently
The way we work together is what sets our love apart
So closely that we can't tell where I end and where you start

[Verse 4]
Love is wide, love is long
Love is deep and love is strong
Love is why I love this song
And I hope you love it too
I remember well the day we wed
I can see that picture in my head
Love isn't just those words we said
It's somethin' that we do

[Outro]
There's no request, too big or small
We give ourselves, we give our all
Love isn't some place that we fall
It's somethin' that we do"
Clint Black,State Of Mind,"[Verse 1]
Got a big leather suitcase, all I own's inside
Seems I've been walkin' for days, can't even bum a ride
Try steppin' to a tune, with the rhythm of a walkin' man
Mind drifts like a big balloon out of my situation at hand

[Chorus]
Ain't it funny how a melody can bring back the memory
Take you to another place in time
Completely change your state of mind

[Verse 2]
Walkin' down a lonely highway not feelin' alone
Thinkin' back when things went my way and not the road I'm on
Well, I've been down a time or two, but it never lasts long
I can always make it through on a wing and a prayer and a song

[Chorus]
Ain't it funny how a melody can bring back the memory
Take you to another place in time
Completely change your state of mind

[Bridge]
It can make a right from a wrong, it can make you fall in love
It can get you singin' along
Chase the clouds away and make the sun shine above

[Chorus]
A melody can bring back a memory
Take you to another place in time
Completely change your state of mind
A melody can bring back a memory
Take you to another place in time
Completely change your state of mind"
Clint Black,A Better Man,"[Verse 1]
What do you say when it's over?
I don't know if I should say anything at all
One day we're rollin' in the clover
Next thing you know, we take the fall

[Verse 2]
Still, I think about the years since I first met you
And the way it might have been without you here
I don't know if words from me can still upset you
But I've just gotta make this memory stand clear

[Chorus]
I know I'm leavin' here a better man
For knowing you this way
Things I couldn't do before now I think I can
And I'm leavin' here a better man

[Verse 3]
I guess, I always knew I couldn't hold you
But I'd never be the one to set you free
Just like some old nursery rhyme your Mama told you
You still believe in some old meant-to-be

[Chorus]
Still, I'm leavin' here a better man
For knowing you this way
Things I couldn't do before now I think I can
And I'm leavin' here a better man
Yes, I'm leavin' here a better man
For knowing you this way
Things I couldn't do before now I know I can
And I'm leavin' here a better man

[Outro]
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Yes, I'm leavin' here a better man"
Clint Black,Nothing’s News,"[Verse 1]
I spent my lifetime wishin' the waitress would come around
Tellin' jokes and shootin' pool on the other side of town
When the whistle blows at five o'clock, there's only one place I'll be found
Down at Ernie's icehouse, liftin' longnecks to that good old country sound

[Chorus]
And talkin' 'bout the good old times
Braggin' on how it used to be
But I've worn out the same old lines
And now it seems nothing's news to me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
There's nothin' like a steel guitar cryin' in the night
There's nothin' like a sawdust floor and a good old friendly fight
I'd finally find my way back home and you'd patch up my face
But that was another time and another place

[Chorus]
Now we're talkin' 'bout the good old times
Braggin' on how it used to be
But I've worn out the same old lines
And now it seems nothing's news to me

[Bridge]
I wonder how I came to be the know-it-all I am
And how the world ever got used to me

[Chorus]
Talkin' 'bout the good old times
Braggin' on how it used to be
But I've worn out the same old lines
And now it seems nothing's news to me"
Clint Black,No Time To Kill,"[Verse 1]
There's no time to kill between the cradle and the grave
Father time still takes a toll on every minute that you save
Legal tender's never gonna change the number on your days
The highest cost of livin's dyin', that's one everybody pays
So have it spent before you get the bill, there's no time to kill

[Verse 2]
If we'd known ten years ago today would be ten years from now
Would we spend tomorrow's yesterdays and make it last somehow
Or lead the cheers in someone else's game and never learn to play
And see the rules of thumb are all the same that measure every day?
The grass is green on both sides of the hill, there's no time to kill

[Chorus]
No time to kill, even I've said it, probably always will
But I can look ahead and see that time ain't standin' still
No time to kill, but time to change the kind of hurry I've been in
Quit this work and worry lookin' back at where I've been
If you don't look ahead, nobody will, there's no time to kill

[Verse 3]
If we had an hourglass to watch each one go by
Or a bell to mark each one to pass, we'd see just how they fly
Would we escalate the value to be worth its weight in gold
Or would we never know the fortunes that we had 'til we grow old?
And do we just keep killin' time until there's no time to kill?

[Chorus]
No time to kill, even I've said it, probably always will
But I can look ahead and see that time ain't standin' still
No time to kill, but time to change the kind of hurry I've been in
Quit this work and worry lookin' back at where I've been
If you don't look ahead, nobody will, there's no time to kill
No time to kill, even I've said it, probably always will
But I can look ahead and see that time ain't standin' still
No time to kill, but time to change the kind of hurry I've been in
Quit this work and worry lookin' back at where I've been
If you don't look ahead, nobody will, there's no time to kill

[Outro]
No time to kill
No time to kill (No time to kill)"
Clint Black,Desperado,"Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
You been out ridin' fences for so long now
Oh, you're a hard one, I know that you got your reasons
These things that are pleasin you can hurt you somehow

Don't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy
She'll beat you if she's able
You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet
Now it seems to me some fine things have been laid upon your table
But you only want the ones you can't get

Desperado, oh you ain't gettin' no younger
Your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home
And freedom, oh freedom, well that's just some people talkin'
Your prison is walkin' through this world all alone

Don't your feet get cold in the winter time
The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the night time from the day
And you're losin all your highs and lows
Ain't it funny how the feelin' goes away

Desperado, why don't you come to your senses
Come down from your fences, open the gate
It may be rainin, but there's a rainbow above you
You better let somebody love you, let somebody love you
You better let somebody love you
Before it's too late"
Clint Black,Walkin’ Away,"[Verse 1]
Walkin' away I saw a side of you
That I knew was there all along
And that someday I'd say goodbye to you
'Cause one right can still make two wrong

[Verse 2]
Not for each other, not from the start
The difference was day and night
My finest hour spent here with you in the dark
Was just before I saw the light

[Chorus]
It's the people who want love and the people who need love
Who find love on the way
I'll be lookin' for someone 'til I find the right one
Then I won't be walkin' away

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Now that I know what I'm tryin' to find
There's only one place it could be
So I'm lookin' ahead, I've stopped lookin' behind
For someone who's lookin' for me

[Chorus]
It's the people who want love and the people who need love
Who find love on the way
I'll be lookin' for someone 'til I find the right one
Then I won't be walkin' away

[Tag]
I'll be lookin' for someone 'til I find the right one
Then I won't be walkin' away"
Clint Black,Summer’s Comin’,"[Chorus]
Nothin' on Earth that'll get me hummin'
Like a heat wave comin' and I'll come runnin'
With her makin' that tan in the broad daylight
And every night is a Saturday night
And everything's right with the summer comin'
I'm the first one standin' in line
For my day in the sun I've been workin' 'til the sun don't shine

[Verse 1]
Takin' off my hat leave it to the boys
Get that old work monkey down off my back
All I want's a little peace and noise
Hit the cruise control get me back on track
Let my old Ford treat me like a Cadillac

[Chorus]
Nothin' on Earth that'll get me hummin'
Like a heat wave comin' and I'll come runnin'
With her makin' that tan in the broad daylight
And every night is a Saturday night
And everything's right with the summer comin'
I'm the first one standin' in line
For my day in the sun I've been workin' 'til the sun don't shine

[Verse 2]
When the day gets cookin' gonna grab my toys
And it really doesn't matter which wave we're on
Get to turnin' up them good old boys
Crankin' into the night, by the break of dawn
All the towns are red and I still see blonde

[Chorus]
Nothin' on Earth that'll get me hummin'
Like a heat wave comin' and I'll come runnin'
With her makin' that tan in the broad daylight
And every night is a Saturday night
And everything's right with the summer comin'
I'm the first one standin' in line
For my day in the sun I've been workin' 'til the sun don't shine

[Outro]
For my day in the sun I've been workin'
'Til the sun don't shine
For my day in the sun I've been workin'
'Til the sun don't shine
Summer's comin' to shine
Summer's comin' to shine
Summer's comin'"
Clint Black,Still Holding On,"There's something out there left for you
But it's not me
We've reached a point of no return
It's only right to set you free

I know I have to turn away
But there's nowhere for my love to go
And there won't come a day
When I won't honor what we've had

But I'll go on with my life
We can even say goodbye for now if
If that's what we have to do
Here in my heart
Even when my arms are empty
Darling, I'm still holding onto you

We can't deny that this one's out of our control
Stronger than the both of us
And bound to take its toll

I can stand the test of time
And as far as I can see
There are no walls that we can't climb
Standing between you and me

But I'll go on with my life
We can even say goodbye for now if
If that's what we have to do
Here in my heart
Even when my arms are empty
Darling, I'm still holding onto you

There's a place you'll always be
No matter where you are you're here with me
When the world is turning upside down
Together we will stand our ground

We can even say goodbye for now if
If that's what we have to do
Here in my heart
Even when my arms are empty
Darling, I'm still holding onto you

I'm still holding onto you
I'm still holding onto you
When I'm gone
When I'm gone, I'm holding on"
Clint Black,Nobody’s Home,"[Verse 1]
Move slowly to my dresser drawers
Put my blue jeans on
Find my cowboy boots, my button down
Strap my timepiece on my arm
Grab my billfold, my pocket change
Just a mindless old routine
Then it's out the door and down the street
But it's not really me

[Chorus]
I still comb my hair the same
Still like the same cologne
And I still drive that pickup truck
That the same old bank still owns
But since you left, everybody says
I'm not the guy they've known
The lights are on, but nobody's home

[Verse 2]
Cup of coffee in the mornin'
It's just food for the brain
I've been numb since our last goodbyes
Haven't felt a thing
But now there's pains in my head and pains in my chest
And I think I'm losing my hair
I'm half a man with half a mind
To think you didn't care

[Chorus]
I still comb my hair the same
Still like the same cologne
And I still drive that pickup truck
That the same old bank still owns
But since you left, everybody says
I'm not the guy they've known
The lights are on, but nobody's home

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Since you left, everybody says
I'm not the guy they've known
The lights are on, but nobody's home
The lights are on, but nobody's home"
Clint Black,Til’ Santa’s Gone (Milk And Cookies),"Now I'm only five years old
I've got to do just what I'm told
'Cause Santa Claus is gonna be dropping in on me

Now is there something I might have missed
I had quite a few things on my list
I hope he can fit it all under that Christmas tree

Now I know what he like for a late night snack
For years now it's been bringing him back
Milk and cookies

He'll come and go without a sound again
But how in the world does he get in
Ain't got a chimney

Close my eyes and concentrate
Try to sleep it's getting late
All night long I lie awake
Till Santa's Gone I just can't wait

Now is there something I might have missed
I had quite a few things on my list
I hope he can get it all under that Christmas tree

Sneak a peek down the hall
I've got to check Now I don't recall
The milk and cookies

I think I'm sure I got it all
Stockings hung a-long the wall
Ain't got a chimney

Close my eyes and concentrate
I gotta sleep now it's getting late
All night long I lie awake
Till Santa's Gone I just can't wait
Just can't wait, just can't wait

Could there be something I might have missed
I had quite a few things on my list
I hope he can fit it all under that Christmas tree
I hope he can fit it all under my Christmas tree

(Spoken)
Get that harmonica under there
And put a guitar under there
And cowboy hat
And a bicycle maybe
And don't know what he's gonna do with that horse..."
Clint Black,The Shoes You’re Wearing,"[Verse 1]
We've all seen enough wrong and right
To know everything's not black and white
There's always somethin' in-between
No matter how long or well you live
You don't get anything you don't give
Still, no slate is clean

[Pre-Chorus]
For better or worse, anybody can
Take a look around and find a better man
Upright no matter how he's farin'
No matter what kind of shoes he's wearin'

[Chorus]
The shoes he's wearin'
They don't make the man

[Verse 2]
So many people out runnin' around
Handicapped before they hit the ground
Thinkin' there's nowhere to go
Shouldn't we all be lookin' for ways
To keep on seein' our better days?
We're not chained to what we know

[Pre-Chorus]
But if your eyes are open and your mind is free
There's no tellin' what a man can be
Upright no matter how you're farin'
No matter what kind of shoes you're wearin'

[Chorus]
The shoes you're wearin'
They don't make the man

[Bridge]
But if you can't walk through the
Best of times and the worst of times
Find your feet, still walkin' the line
You'll never carry the load worth bearin'
No matter what kind of shoes you're wearin'

[Chorus]
The shoes you're wearin' (Shoes)
They don't make the man
The shoes you're wearin' (Shoes)
They won't make the man

[Outro]
Shoes
Don't make the man
Shoes
Won't make the man
Shoes
Don't make the man
Shoes
Don't make the man"
Clint Black,You Still Get To Me,"[Verse 1]
I know your secret
It’s easy to tell
Ain’t what you’re wearing
Or what you do that well
You can put on anything
Pretty dress or blue jeans
And you still get to me

[Verse 2]
First time I saw you
Honey, you lit a flame
I started melting
And I still feel the same
Baby you hold the key
One touch can set me free
And you still get to me

[Chorus]
Love still feeling new
I still look at you that way
It’s getting stronger everyday
I keep reaching for you
I couldn’t want you more
It’s something anyone can see
You still get to me

[Verse 3]
Love is a message
It always gets through
Just like the sun
Is gonna shine on that moon
Just like a mountain stream
We’ll always find the sea
Baby you get to me

[Chorus]
Love still feeling new
I still look at you that way
It’s getting stronger everyday
I keep reaching for you
I couldn’t want you more
It’s something anyone can see
You still get to me

[Bridge]
The way you hold me
The way you whisper in my ear
The way you hold me
The way you run your fingers through my hair
The way you love me
Year after year, after year

[Chorus]
Love still feeling new
I still look at you that way
It’s getting stronger everyday
I keep reaching for you
I couldn’t want you more
It’s something anyone can see
You still get to me

[Outro]
You still get to me
You still get to me"
Clint Black,Wherever You Go,"[Verse 1]
Bottle of scotch whiskey not very smooth
Like snake bite cure from the medicine man
Not bad poison if there's something to soothe
It's a whole other world in the palm of your hand

Out of this world and out of your mind
Just like it don't matter what you're leaving behind
Trying to change your life you change your point of view
But no matter what you do it's the same old you

[Chorus]
Wherever you go there you are
You can run from yourself but you won't get far
You can dive to the bottom of your medicine jar
But wherever you go there you are

[Verse 2]
Bottle of scotch whiskey whatever you find
When you're out on a wire it's a matter of time
Changing every moment when you're taking the fall
There's everything to gain when you're losing it all

Feel your head spinning with your feet on the ground
You climb the wrong ladder and it's keeping you down
Think you're gettin' higher but you're still layin' low
You don't want to be anyone you know

[Chorus]
Wherever you go there you are
You can run from yourself but you won't get far
You can dive to the bottom of your medicine jar
But wherever you go there you are

[Verse 3]
Once you've been bitten it's like crossing a line
It's a part of the plan all that's on your mind
Think that it'll help you find somebody to be
But the man in the mirror is all you'll see

[Chorus]
Wherever you go there you are
You can run from yourself but you won't get far
You can dive to the bottom of your medicine jar
But wherever you go there you are"
Clint Black,When My Ship Comes In,"[Verse 1]
No sun on the Rockies, not even the light of day
I feel that old cabin fever coming on
But I know where I'll be when lady luck finally blows my way
She'll put the wind in my sails and I'll be gone

[Chorus]
It won't be long before my ship comes in
Gonna sail right out of Colorado
Catch a ride on a warm trade wind to Puerta No-One-Knows
She'll find me waiting when my ship comes in
Gonna board and go whichever way the wind blows
I'll be off to find myself once again in Puerta No-One-Knows
When my ship comes in

[Verse 2]
Maybe I'm only dreaming but it sure seems real
Somehow the wind doesn't chill quite to the bone
Or could it just be the fever, I'm running on an uneven keel
Not losing sight of why I'm up here alone

[Chorus]
It won't be long before my ship comes in
Gonna sail right out of Colorado
Catch a ride on a warm trade wind to Puerta No-One-Knows
She'll find me waiting when my ship comes in
Gonna board and go whichever way the wind blows
I'll be off to find myself once again in Puerta No-One-Knows
When my ship comes in

[Outro]
In Puerta No-One-Knows
When my ship comes in
It won't be long before my ship comes in
She'll find me waiting when my ship comes in
It won't be long before my ship comes in
She'll find me waiting when my ship comes in
When my ship comes in"
Clint Black,Spend My Time,"How can we know how far the long way can be
Looking from where we are it never seemed that long to me
I've many miles behind me, maybe not so much ahead
It seems I made good time with the directions I misread

So I'm gonna spend my time like it's going out of style
I'm moving the bottom line farther than a country mile
I still have hills to climb before I hit that wall
No matter how much time I buy I could never spend it all

Funny thing that time, we're always running out
I'm always losing mine, there's not enough of it about
And though it's always here it will always come and go
The days become the years that'll be gone before you know

So I'm gonna spend my time like it's going out of style
I'm moving the bottom line better than a country mile
I still have hills to climb before I hit that wall

I won't go quietly into that dark night
There'll be no more buring daylight
I'll be living in every moment that I'm in

Oh, I'm gonna spend my time like it's going out of style
I'll only use what's mine, I've been saving for awhile
I still have hills to climb before I hit that wall
No matter how much time I buy I could never spend it all

No matter how much time I buy I could never spend it all..."
Clint Black,Tuckered Out,"[Verse 1]
I've seen more than a Little Texas and a Playboy always knows
A man does what he Wills as long as he stays on his toes
He can Russell up a fortune, any man could strike it Rich
But I'm doin' good to keep it Strait and keep my wheels out of the ditch
Ain't no Foster for the Desert Rose, the babblin' Brooks are Dunn
That Crystal ball won't even book me one day in the Sun

[Chorus]
I'm Haggard, worn, and Waylon
From the bottom of my Restless Heart
Don't know Wy the Black cloud's tailin' me
There seems to be no Parton from the dark
And I've had it to the Gills of knowin'
What the Nitty Gritty's all about
Bein' McEntired and Loveless
I can't Lovett if I'm all tuckered out

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Well, I never meant to set out like a half-cocked Gatlin gun
No highway Head Hunter's gonna let this Rabbitt run
I ain't Raven 'bout The Ride, I probably got no fate to Seal
If I can't roll through Alabama half Asleepin' At The Wheel
All my Paychecks are like dried-up Wells and way too small to Cash
Or I'd find a roadside motel, lay some money down to Crash

[Chorus]
I'm Haggard, worn, and Waylon
From the bottom of my Restless Heart
Don't know Wy the Black cloud's tailin' me
There seems to be no Parton from the dark
And I've had it to the Gills of knowin'
What the Nitty Gritty's all about
Bein' McEntired and Loveless
I can't Lovett if I'm all tuckered out"
Clint Black,Where Are You Now,"[Verse 1]
Maybe I took for granted you'd be around
To pick me up on my way down
I thought my feet were planted firmly on the ground
'Til one day my whole world came unwound

[Verse 2]
Like a ball of yarn kept neatly on a spool
You held the life together of this broken hearted fool
And what was once the exception now seems to be the rule

[Chorus]
There's a burning question afire in my mind
You always had the answers to the ones I couldn't find
So all I'm asking is, where are you now?

[Verse 3]
What Father Time would sell me, I'd take it all if only you'd be back around
But then if time should spell me I might take the call, but there's no way of knowing where I'm bound

[Verse 4]
So here it comes, another fine mess I've got into
And if I knew which way to turn I'd still turn to you
So if everything is said and done, what am I supposed to do?

[Chorus]
That's the burning question, on fire in my mind
You always had the answers for me, time after time
So all I'm asking is, where are you now?

[Outro]
All I'm asking is, where are you now?"
Clint Black,Better and Worse,"[Verse 1]
I've been better, I've been worse
I've been blessed, and I've been cursed
Ain't dead last, and I ain't in first
Not everything's gonna go my way

[Verse 2]
I've been better, I've been worse
I'm right on purpose and unrehearsed
Singin' in the chorus, when I need more verse
Not everything's gonna go my way

[Chorus]
So I push too hard, I lean too far
Thinkin' I can have it all
Then I stumble just a little, I end up in the middle
Thanking God Almighty I didn't lose it all

[Verse 3]
I've been better, I've been worse
I can do without the doctor but I need my nurse
My heart's beatin' steady, but it's in reverse
Not everything's gonna go my way

[Chorus 2]
So I push too hard, and lean too far
Thinkin' I can have it all
Then I stumble just a little, and I end up in the middle
Banging my head against a brand new wall

[Verse 4]
I've been better, I've been worse
I got a yin yang thing and a tie for first
I guess I ain't the center of the universe
Not everything's gonna go my way

[Tag]
I've been worse, I text with the best but I can't converse
I got a little money but it's in...her purse
Not everything's gonna go my way

[Instrumental]"
Brenda Lee,Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree,"[Verse]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later, we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling

[Pre-Chorus]
You will get a sentimental feeling
When you hear
Voices singing, ""Let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly""

Everyone's dancin' merrily
In the new old-fashioned way

I didn't know love could be so cruel

What are you doing?
Oh, don't you know
Don't you know you'll be my ruin?

When will you let this heartache end?

You get me upset
Why make me remember, what I wanna forget?
I've been lonely, lonely too long
Emotions, please leave me alone

You worry my days

Brenda Lee,If You Love Me (Really Love Me),"If the sun should tumble from the skies
If the sea should suddenly run dry
If you love me, really love me
Let it happen, I won't care
If it seems that everything is lost
I will smile and never count the cost
If you love me, really love me
Let it happen
Darling I won't care

Shall I catch a shooting star?
Shall I bring it where you are?
If you want me to I will
You can set me any test
I'll do anything you ask
If you’d only say you love me still

When at last, our life on earth is through
I will share eternity with you

Make me feel that you still love me, if it's just, if it's just for one more day
Break it to me gently, so my tears, my tears won't fall too fast

If you must go, then go slowly
Let me love you 'till the last

The love we shared, for oh so long is such a big part of me
If you must take your love away, take it gradually

Oh, oh...break it, break it to me gently
Give me time, oh give me a little time to ease the pain
Love me just a little longer, cause I'll never never love again
Cause I'll never love again"

All alone am I ever since your goodbye
All alone with just the beat of my heart
People all around but I don't hear a sound
Just the lonely beating of my heart

No use in holding other hands
For I'd be holding only emptiness
No use in kissing other lips
For I'd be thinking just of your caress

All alone am I ever since your goodbye
All alone with just the beat of my heart
People all around but I don't hear a sound
Just the lonely beating of my heart

No other voice can say the words
My heart must hear to ever sing again
The words you used to whisper low
No other love can ever bring again

All alone am I ever since your goodbye
All alone with just the beat of my heart
People all around but I don't hear a sound
Just the lonely beating of my heart"
Brenda Lee,Now He’s Coming Home,"Well, here he comes
The plane is on the runway
And it's right on time
It's been so long since he left me here
To make it on my own
And then he called
He said his life was empty and he's sorry now
He's changed his mind
He tells me that he still loves me like he always did
And now he's coming home

And now I see him smiling
And he's waving as he steps upon the runway
Yes, I can see him running now
And I can hear him calling out my name
The tears are falling in my eyes
Cause now I have to find a way to tell him
That I couldn't wait forever
And I made a new life with another man

Well, here he comes, the man I loved
But grew tired of waiting for
He stayed away
And I just couldn't stand to be alone
I'll never know just why he left me here
And I still love him so
But now it's done
I couldn't wait forever and I wish I had
Cause now he's coming home

Yes, here he comes, yes here he comes
No, I couldn't wait forever and I wish I had
Cause now he's - coming home
Well, here he comes"
Brenda Lee,The End of the World,"Why does the sun go on shining
Why does the sea rush to shore
Don't they know it's the end of the world
'cause you don't love me anymore,Yes

Why do the birds go on singing
Why do the stars glow above
Don't they know it's the end of the world
It ended when I lost your love

I wake up in the mornin' and I wonder
Why everythings the same as it was
I can't understand, no
I can't understand

How life goes on the way it does
Why does my heart go on beating
Why do these eyes of mine cry
Don't they know it's the end of the world
It ended when you said goodbye

(spoken)
Why does my heart go on beating
Why do these eyes of mine cry
(sung)
Don't they know it's the end of the world
It ended when you said goodbye
Goodbye"

And I'm rocking to the blues cause

Duck tail flying as he bopped by
Little Willie crew cut is sitting by me
But he's so dumb, that he can't see

Don't ever cry for me
This is goodbye for me
I know we're through
I'm Losing you

Love sang it's song for me
Then things went wrong for me
Nights are too long for me
Because I'm losing you

Our love and our devotion
Were deep as any ocean
Then one day like the tide you began to change
And you became a perfect stranger

Sharing the lips I knew
I can't believe it's true
That I am losing you

I can't believe it's true
That I am losing you"

Love me right
Hey baby, let's make history tonight
The power of one hour of love's delight
Just knocks me out like dynamite

(Dynamite)
You do such big-attraction chain-reaction
Things to me
They oughtta make you wear a sign of Danger
T.N.T

Love me right
Hey baby, let's make history tonight
The power of one hour of love's delight
Just knocks me out like dynamite

Because you're dynamite
Because you're dynamite
Because you're dynamite (You're dynamite)"
Brenda Lee,Someone To Love Me (The Prisoner’s Song),"Oh I wish I had someone to love me
Someone to call me their own
How I wish I had someone to live with
'Cause I'm tired of livin' alone
Please meet me tonight in the moonlight
Please meet me tonight alone
For I have a sad story to tell you
It's a story that's never been told
Oh, if I had wings like an angel
Through the heavenly sky high I would fly
I'd fly to the arms of my darlin'
And there I'd be willing to die"
Keith Urban,Blue Ain’t Your Color,"[Verse 1]
I can
See you over there starin' at your drink
Watchin' that ice sink, all alone tonight
And
Chances are you're sittin' here in this bar
'Cause he ain't gonna treat you right
Well, it's
Probably not my place but I'm gonna say it anyway
'Cause you look like
You
Haven't felt the fire, had a little fun
Hadn't had a smile in a little while, baby

[Chorus]
Blue
Looks good on the sky
Looks good on that neon buzzin' on the wall
But darlin', it don't match your eyes
I'm tellin' you
You don't need that guy
It's so black and white, he's stealin' your thunder
Baby, blue ain't your color

[Verse 2]
I'm not tryna
Be another just pick you up kinda guy
Tryna drink you up, tryna take you home
But I just
I don't understand how another man
Can take your sun and turn it ice cold
Well, I've
Had enough to drink and it's makin' me think
That I just might
Tell you
If I were a painter I wouldn't change ya
I'd just paint you bright, baby

[Chorus]
'Cause blue
Looks good on the sky
Looks good on that neon buzzin' on the wall
But darlin', it don't match your eyes
I'm tellin' you
You don't need that guy
It's so black and white, he's stealin' your thunder
Baby, blue ain't your color

No, no, no

Blue
Looks good on the sky
Looks good on that neon buzzin' on the wall
But darlin', it don't match your eyes

Keith Urban,Female,"[Verse 1]
When you hear somebody say somebody hits like a girl
How does that hit you?
Is that such a bad thing?
When you hear a song that they play sayin' you run the world
Do you believe it?
Will you live to see it?

[Verse 2]
When somebody laughs and implies that she asked for it
Just cause she was wearing a skirt
Oh, is that how that works?
When somebody talks about how it was Adam first
Does that make you second best?
Or did he save the best for last?

Made you scared of love, too scared to love

He didn't know what he had and I thank God, oh
And it's gonna take just a little time
But you're gonna see that I was born to love you

What if I fall?
I won't let you fall

Keith Urban,One Too Many,"[Intro: P!nk]
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Keith Urban]
I don't remember much about last night
Woke up on a couch sun-rise
Saw the living room
Through these bloodshot eyes of mine, cold sober
You didn’t like that I came home late
4 AM but it's a Friday, babe
And I've been working hard
Can't you give me some space 'stead of shouting out, ""Oh my God""?

[Pre-Chorus: Keith Urban & P!nk]
Oh-oh, ooh-yeah
Oh-oh, ooh-yeah
I go out with some new friends
But it just makes me miss you more, more

[Chorus: Keith Urban & P!nk]
I spend all my money drinking on my own, yeah
In this bar, just sat here staring at my phone
And I keep second guessing, where did I go wrong?
I know I'm proud
But I've had one too many
Come take me home

[Verse 2: P!nk]
So now I'm the one that's crying
I didn't wanna call 'cause I didn't wanna fight
I swear that I was trying, yeah
But everybody falls when their head's a little high
And I've never meant to get so out my mind
With you playing cool, just pretending it's fine
Oh, we've been 'round, 'round, 'round this
Too many times before

[Pre-Chorus: Keith Urban & P!nk]
Oh-oh, ooh yeah
Oh-oh, ooh yeah
I go out with some new friends
But it just makes me miss you more, more

In this bar, just sat here staring at my phone
And I keep second guessing, where did I go wrong?
I know I'm proud
But I've had one too many
Come take me home

[Bridge: Keith Urban & P!nk, P!nk]
I don't know how lucky, how lucky I am, I am, I am, no
I guess sometimes I should give more of a damn, a damn, a damn about you
I don't know how lucky, how lucky I am, I am, I am, no
I know we're both stubborn
Push each other's buttons
I'd rather do it with you, but...
I spend all my money drinking on my own, yeah
In this bar, just sat here staring at my phone

[Chorus: Keith Urban & P!nk]
I spend all my money drinking on my own, yeah
In this bar, just sat here staring at my phone
And I keep second guessing, where did I go wrong?

Keith Urban,Parallel Line,"[Verse 1]
You said ""I love you"" to me
And I don't know what that means
So I froze on my feet
People use it so carelessly
And I couldn't believe
That you would dive in so deep
And you said perfectly
Everything I've been feelin' about you

[Pre-Chorus]
It's time to break the chains
That held me back from you, so come on and

[Chorus]
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, I literally don't mind
Just please don't misplace it
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, baby, be mine now
Baby, be mine now
Maybe it's time we
Put our hearts in a parallel line

[Verse 2]
Well, I was never the type
To put it all on the line
But I've been changing my mind
Since you opened my eyes
It was the way that the light
Picked you out of that night
Then you were right by my side
Put a soul in my body

[Pre-Chorus]
And now it's time to close
The space between the two of us, so come on and

[Chorus]
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, I literally don't mind
Just please don't misplace it
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, baby, be mine now
Baby, be mine now
Maybe it's time we
Put our hearts in a parallel line

[Bridge]
Oh, baby, it's time
Mm, it's time

Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, I literally don't mind
Just please don't misplace it
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, baby, be mine now
Baby, be mine now
And take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, I literally don't mind
Just please don't misplace it
And take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, baby, be mine now
Baby, be mine now
Maybe it's time we
Put our hearts in a parallel line

Keith Urban,Got It Bad,"[Verse 1]
I hit the highway and I checked the time
I see the sunrise and it makes me wanna change my mind
Oh I got it bad
I stopped for coffee in a no where town
A pretty waitress says, hey what's the frown
Boy you've got it bad
Well so many times you told me before
If I don't like it, well there's the door
This time I've gone for good and I got it bad

[Chorus]
I got it badder than a broken heart
Badder than the Devil's smile
And I can't face bein' apart
I guess I'll have to leave but meanwhile
Oohh I got it bad

[Verse 2]
Moonlight on the water still looks the same
Pretty girl beside me but I don't know her name
Guess I got it bad
I'm too weak to say no, too lonely to care
I'll believe her if she says hey baby
I got love to spare
Well tomorrow I'll take it like a man
Tonight I'm takin' all I can
This time I went for good and I got it bad

[Chorus]
I got it badder than a broken heart
Badder than the Devil's smile
And I can't face bein' apart
I guess I'll have to leave but meanwhile
Oohh I got it bad
I got it badder than a broken heart
Badder than the Devil's smile
And I can't face bein' apart
I guess I'll have to leave but meanwhile
Oohh I got it bad
I got it badder than a broken heart
Badder than the Devil's smile
And I can't face bein' apart
I guess I'll have to leave but meanwhile

There's a new wind blowing like I've never known
I'm breathing deeper than I've ever done
And it sure feels good, to finally feel the way I do

[Hook]
And I wanna love somebody
Love somebody like you

Shining down on me and you
When you put your arms around me
You let me know there's nothing in this world I can't do

Couldn't walk a straight line even if I wanted to

Keith Urban,Break on Me,"[Verse 1]
There'll be days your heart don't wanna beat
You pray more than you breathe
And you just wanna fall to pieces
And nights, those 2 AM calls
Where dreams become walls
And you just need a break
Break on me

[Chorus]
Shatter like glass
Come apart in my hands
Take as long as it takes, girl
Break on me
Put your head on my chest
Let me help you forget
When your heart needs to break
Just break on me

[Verse 2]
There'll be times when someone you know
Becomes someone you knew
But you'd do anything to change it
And words you wanna take back
But you know you can't
When the page just won't turn
And it still hurts
Break on me

[Chorus]
Shatter like glass
Come apart in my hands
Take as long as it takes, girl
Break on me
Put your head on my chest
Let me help you forget
When your heart needs to break
Just break on me
(Ooo oo aah aah, ooo oo aaah aah ooo ooo aaah aaah)

Oh, when you need somebody
When you need somebody right now
You're where I'll be
Break on me

Come apart in my hands

Put your head on my chest
Let me help you forget
When your heart needs to break
Just break on me

Keith Urban,You’ll Think of Me,"[Verse 1]
I woke up early this morning around 4am
With the moon shining bright
As headlights on the interstate
I pulled the covers over my head
And tried to catch some sleep
But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake
Ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms
I've been trying my best to get along
But that's OK
There's nothing left to say, but

[Chorus]
Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me

[Verse 2]
I went out driving trying to clear my head
I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left
I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this
And all the baggage that seems to still exist
It seems the only blessing I have left to my name
Is not knowing what we could have been
What we should have been
So

[Chorus]
Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me

[Bridge]
Someday I'm going to run across your mind
Don't worry, I'll be fine
I'm going to be alright
While you're sleeping with your pride
Wishing I could hold you tight
I'll be over you
And on with my life

[Chorus]
So take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me
Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
Take your space and all your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Because we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me, oh

And you're going to think of me
Oh yeah
Ooh someday baby, someday
Oooh ooh ooh oh
Think of me
Ooh ooh dumdum dirumdum baby"

Let me carry your burden
If somethin' ain’t right, I will let you know

Let me carry your burden

I’ll get you back on a high when you're feeling low
When the weight's too heavy, but you won't let go

[Chorus]
Come to me, my brother, and I will sit with you awhile
Pretty soon, I'll see you smile and you know you will
No matter how much you're hurting right now

When your mouth's on fire, but your mind is cold
And you're fanning flames that won’t keep you warm

Come to me, my brother, and I will sit with you a while
Pretty soon, I’ll see you smile and you know you will
No matter how much you're hurting right now

Keith Urban,Gemini,"[Verse 1]
She's not quite a contradiction
She rolls with it
Quick with a snap decision
I'm fine with it
Strong on her strong opinions
I'm weak for it

I want all of it, huh

[Pre-Chorus]
Mmm
Emotionally, physically, diving right into me
Mmm
Emotionally, physically, getting a hold of me

She's spinning around the room
When she's spinning around the room
She got the stars comin' out of her eyes
Got everybody staring, like they're caught in the headlights
A little bit left, a little bit right
She'll wake you to make love in the middle of the night
And every breath that I take is brand new
I'm a man brought back to life
Castor and Pollux sent you to save me
I've returned to my Gemini

Living and loving you

There's a way, oh everybody say
You can do anything, every thing yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
But what good, what good
Honey, what good could it ever bring
Because I haven't got you with my love
And I can't find you babe, no I can't

[Chorus]
You don't know, you don't know what it's like
No you don't, honey no you don't know
You don't know what it's like
To love anybody
Oh honey, I want to talk about love
And trying to hold somebody
The way I love you babe
And I've been loving you babe

[Verse 2]
In my brain, oh I can see your face again
I know my frame of mind, yeah
But nobody, nobody has to ever be so blind
Honey, like I did, I know I was blind
Honey, I tell you that I was, I was very, very blind
Oh but I'm just a girl
Can't you just take a look at me and tell
Tell that I live, honey I live and I breathe for you
Don't you know I do!

[Pre-Chorus]
But what good, what good
Honey, what good could it ever bring
Because I haven't got you with my love
And I can't find you babe, no I can't

[Chorus]
You don't know, you don't know what it's like
No you don't, honey no you don't know
You don't know what it's like
To love anybody
Oh honey, I want to talk about love
And trying to hold somebody
The way I love you babe
And I've been loving you babe

[Bridge]
Oh, I know that there's a way
Because everybody came to me one time and said
""Honey, you can do anything
Every little thing, and I think I can
Oh, but what good, what good
Honey, what awfully good can it ever, ever bring
Because I can't find you with my love
And I can't find you babe, oh anywhere"
Keith Urban,Wasted Time,"[Verse 1]
The rain is coming down tonight
I'm smiling looking at this photograph
I hear that song and I'm flying right back to when we had it made
Every Friday night when the sun went down
We'd be running them streets like we owned the town

[Pre-Chorus]
And I just can't let it go, no, I just can't let it go
I wonder if you ever think about it like I do
Seven kids on a two lane road
Had The Guns on the radio
After all this time it still feels so good

[Chorus 1]
When I think about those summer nights
Singin' out the window, on the back roads, ""Sweet Child of Mine""
Sippin' on the Loko's, spark a light
Ain't it funny how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time?
All that wasted time

[Verse 2]
Out of nowhere, it slipped away
And the rope by the river hangs silently
And the town that I knew ain't nothing like it used to be, ah
I can't explain
They took all the color from the picture frame
And the days got sold to the grit and the game

[Pre-Chorus]
But I just can't let it go, no, I just can't let it go
I wonder if you ever think about it like I do
Seven kids on my two lane road
We had The Guns on the radio
After all this time it still feels so good

[Chorus 2]
When I think about those summer nights
Singin' out the window, on the back roads, ""Sweet Child of Mine""
Sippin' on the Loko's, spark a light, yeah
Ain't it funny how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time?
All that wasted time
Swinging out on the line
Living all that wasted time

[Post-Chorus]
Hey, hey, now, woo
Ah yeah

[Bridge]
Summer dresses dryin' out on the hood of the car
Only music that we had was out the left speaker
We were living every second 'til the time ran out
We had nothing but we had it all

[Chorus 3]
When I think about those summer nights
Sneaking out the window, running back roads, your hand in mine
We were going nowhere, we were so alive, uh-huh
Ain't it crazy how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time?
All that wasted time
We were swinging out on the line
Living all that wasted time

[Outro]
Hey, you know, oh
Don't you feel it coming on back now?
Yeah, yeah"
Keith Urban,Never Comin Down,"[Verse 1]
I can feel it comin' on now
As the music plays
Takin' shots with the night owls
As the world just fades away
Got a paycheck in my pocket
'Bout to get it all gone
Light it up like a rocket
We're goin' all night long

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody sing (Ooh)
Mm, I love it when you (ooh)

[Chorus]
When the sun goes down, stars come out
It's a, can you feel it?
Wanna take you by the hand, dancin'
And we'll pass it around, 'round, 'round
Yeah, we're so high, we could paint the sky
Tear the top right off the ceilin'
And I swear we're never ever comin' down
Never comin' down

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh woah) Ooh yeah, tell me now, can you feel it?
(Oh woah) Never ever, never comin' down

[Verse 2]
Well, the band's on fire
And the beer is ice cold
We're goin' down to the wire
Then we'll all go rolling home
And maybe we'll keep it goin'
'Til we see that sun comin' up
Right here, right now
I wanna see you move and hear you sing it out loud

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ooh)

[Chorus]
When the sun goes down, stars come out
It's a, can you feel it?
Wanna take you by the hand, dancin'
And we'll pass it around, 'round, 'round
Yeah, we're so high, we could paint the sky
Tear the top right off the ceilin'
And I swear we're never ever comin' down (Comin' down)
Never comin' down

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh woah) Ooh yeah, tell me now, can you feel it?
(Oh woah) Never ever, never comin' down
(Oh woah) Ooh yeah, tell me now, can you feel it?
(Oh woah, never comin' down)

[Bridge]
Dance, baby, dance, baby, don't stop now
Dance, baby, dance, baby, don't stop now
I say oh now, oh now, oh now, oh now
Dance, baby, dance, baby
I say oh now, oh now, oh now, oh now
Wait a minute, baby, tell me one more time, she say now
Oh now, oh now, oh now, oh now
Dance, baby, dance, baby, dance, baby
Oh now, oh now, oh now, oh now (Don't stop now)

[Chorus]
When the sun goes down, the stars come out
It's a, can you feel it?
Wanna take you by the hand, dancin'
And we'll pass it around, 'round, 'round (Pass it around)
Yeah, we're so high, we could paint the sky
With the love right now, we feel it (I feel it)
And I swear we're never ever comin' down (Never comin' down)
Never comin' down

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh woah) Ooh yeah, tell me now, can you feel it?
(Oh woah) Never comin' down
(Oh woah) Ooh yeah, tell me now, can you feel it?
(Oh woah) Never comin' down"
Keith Urban,Stupid Boy,"[Verse 1]
Well, she was precious like a flower
She grew wild, wild, but innocent
A perfect prayer in a desperate hour
She was everything beautiful and different

[Pre-Chorus]
Stupid boy, you can't fence that in
Stupid boy, it's like holding back the wind

[Chorus]
She laid her heart and soul right in your hands
And you stole her every dream and you crushed her plans
She never even knew she had a choice
And that's what happens when the only voice she hears is telling her she can't
Stupid boy
Stupid boy, oh

[Verse 2]
So what made you think you could take a life
And just push it, push it around
I guess to build yourself up so high
You had to take her and break her down

[Chorus]
Stupid boy, you can't fence that in
Stupid boy, it's like holding back the wind
She laid her heart and soul right in your hands
And you stole her every dream and you crushed her plans
She never even knew she had a choice
And that's what happens when the only voice she hears is telling her she can't
You stupid boy

[Bridge 1]
Oh, you always had to be right
But now you've lost the only thing that ever made you feel alive
Ooh, yeah

[Chorus]
Well, she laid her heart and soul right in your hands
And you stole her every dream and you crushed her plans
Yes, you did
She never even knew she had a choice
And that's what happens when the only voice she hears is telling her she can't
You stupid boy, oh
I'm the same old, same old stupid boy

[Bridge 2]
It took a while for her to figure out she could run
But when she did, she was long gone, long gone

[Outro]
Ah, she's gone, she's long gone
Yes, she's gone
Yeah, oh
Nobody's ever going to love me like she loved me
And she loved me, she loved me
God, please, just let her know
I'm sorry
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
Baby
Yeah, I'm down on my knees
She's never coming back to me"
Keith Urban,For You,"[Verse 1]
All I saw was smoke and fire
I didn’t feel a thing
But suddenly I was rising higher
And I felt like I just made
The biggest mistake
When I thought about my unborn child
When I thought about my wife
And the answer rang out clear
From somewhere up above
No greater gift has man
Than to lay down his life for love

[Hook]
And I wonder, would I give my life
Could I make that sacrifice
If it came down to it
Could I take the bullet, I would
Yes I would, for you

[Verse 2]
Maybe you don’t understand
I don’t understand it all myself
But there’s a brother on my left and another on my right
And in his pocket just like mine
He’s got a photograph
And they’re waiting for him back home
It’s weighing on my mind
I’m not trying to be a hero
I don’t wanna die
But right now in this moment, you don’t think twice

[Hook]
And I wonder, would I give my life
Could I make that sacrifice
If it came down to it
Could I take the bullet, I would
Yes I would, for you

You don’t think about right
You don’t think about wrong
You just do what you gotta do, to defend your own
And I’d do the same
For you
Yes I would

I would give my life
I would make that sacrifice
Cause if it came down to it
Could I take a bullet
For you
Yes I would

I’d do it for you"
Keith Urban,Tonight I Wanna Cry,"[Verse 1]
Alone in this house again tonight
I got the TV on, the sound turned down and a bottle of wine
There's pictures of you and I on the walls around me
The way that it was and could have been surrounds me
I'll never get over you walking away

[Chorus]
I've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show
And I thought that being strong meant never losing your self-control
But I'm just drunk enough to let go of my pain
To hell with my pride, let it fall like rain
From my eyes
Tonight I wanna cry

[Verse 2]
Would it help if I turned a sad song on
""All By Myself"" would sure hit me hard now that you're gone
Or maybe unfold some old yellow lost love letters
It's going to hurt bad before it gets better
But I'll never get over you by hiding this way

[Chorus]
I've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show
And I thought that being strong meant never losing your self-control
But I'm just drunk enough to let go of my pain
To hell with my pride, let it fall like rain
From my eyes
Tonight I wanna cry
I've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show
And I thought that being strong meant never losing your self-control
But I'm just drunk enough to let go of my pain
To hell with my pride, let it fall like rain
From my eyes
Tonight I wanna cry"
Keith Urban,Somewhere In My Car,"[Verse 1]
I'm driving home tonight, catching all red lights
That's alright 'cause I don't wanna be alone
There's nobody waitin' there, cold and empty bed
Words I wished I'd said come on the radio

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, and I don't know why I do this to myself
Ooh, I know you're with someone else

[Chorus]
But in my mind, we're somewhere in my car
And it's raining hard on the streetlight glow
You got your lips on mine, it's gasoline on fire, I never will forget
You grabbed my shirt and pulled it over my head
And your fingertips slide up and down my back
Breathin' hard, steamin' up the glass
I'd give anything if I could bring it back, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
So I've been sleeping 'til noon in the same bedroom
Where I once held you and it's breaking my heart
I should take down all those pictures from my wall
Promises we made won't fill this empty space

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, and I don't know why I just can't let you go
Ooh, I know you're never coming back

[Chorus]
But in my mind, we're somewhere in my car
And it's raining hard on the streetlight glow
You got your lips on mine, it's gasoline on fire, I never will forget
You grabbed my shirt and pulled it over my head
And your fingertips slide up and down my back
Breathin' hard, steamin' up the glass
I'd give anything if I could bring it back oh, oh, oh
If I could bring it back

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
In my mind, we're somewhere in my car
And it's raining hard on the streetlight glow
You got your lips on mine, it's gasoline on fire, I never will forget
You grabbed my shirt and pulled it over my head
And your fingertips slide up and down my back
Breathin' hard, steamin' up the glass
I'd give anything if I could bring it back oh, oh, oh

[Outro]
If I could bring you back, yeah
If I just close my eyes, ooh, ooh
I could feel you breathin' me
Oh, and your fingertips slide up and down my back"
Keith Urban,My Wave,"[Verse 1: Keith Urban]
I roll with the punches
I go with the flow
I used to fight against the tide
But I learned my lesson and now I know
That there's a better way to live this life
You've got to find your song and just sing it
And there's a better way to feel alright
Let it all go and let love take control

[Chorus: Keith Urban]
I just ride
On a wave so free, just you and me
Coming alive
It feels so good just watching the world going by
Doing my thing out here, vibing and riding my wave
Mmm, every day
Why would I wanna live any other way
Than riding my wave? Yeah

[Verse 2: Keith Urban]
We all got problems
I've had my share of pain
I got scars in places that you can't even see, baby
But it made me who I am today
So when it rains, when there's a hurricane
You got to find your wave and just surf it
Put some love in the world, find a boy or a girl
To heal all the hurt 'cause you know you deserve it

[Chorus: Keith Urban]
So ride
On a wave so free, just you and me
Coming alive
It feels so good just watching the world going by
Doing my thing out here, vibing and riding my wave
Mmm, every day
Why would I wanna live any other way
Than riding my wave? Yeah

[Verse 3: Shy Carter]
You gotta watch out for the shine blockers
Me, I'm just a time stopper
We gon' get there when we get there lil’ mama
We gotta depend on the waaaaaave
Leanin' and dreamin'
Pullin' up on the scene and we sting 'em
Focused and floatin', we drinkin' and singin'

[Bridge: Keith Urban & Shy Carter]
Been a long time coming, but it's all (it's all good baby)
For the better (oh yeah)
What we can't do alone, we can all do together

[Chorus: Keith Urban]
Let's ride
Oh, oh
We're coming alive
It feels so good just watching the world going by
Doing my thing out here, vibing and riding my wave
Yeah, every day
Now why would I wanna live any other way?
Ride
Everyday, everyday
By
Oh, everyday, everyday
Ride
Oh, oh, oh, I feel it baby, woo, woo
By"
Keith Urban,We Were,"[Verse 1]
We were just a couple years short of the age
By my name on a fake ID
And still 'bout a hundred away from the day
Your daddy said you could run with me
We were a couple of line steppers
Who just couldn’t wait to step over the line
Never thinkin' we wouldn't last
I was your first and you were mine

[Chorus]
And we were leather jackets hangin’ onto a Harley
Two heartbeats in the moonlight
We were both feet hangin' out over the edge
Of the water tower skyline
At least there's a little bit of sweet in the bitter
Though a part of me is always gonna miss her
I am who I am, I just miss who I was when we were
Mm-hmm

[Verse 2]
We were gonna make it, weren't we, baby?
Had it all laid out in our mind
By the time we knew time was runnin' out
We'd done run out of time
And we were downtown Saturday night, last-call cover band
'Til the last song played, never thought we'd fade
Like the stamp on the back of her hand

[Chorus]
We were her on my shoulders, lighter in the air
""Pour Some Sugar On Me""
We were a top down at Johnson’s field
When she whispered that she wants me
At least there’s a little bit of sweet in the bitter
Though a part of me is always gonna miss her
I am who I am, I just miss who I was when we were
Oh, mm-hmm

[Chorus]
We were leather jackets hangin' onto a Harley
Two heartbeats in the moonlight
We were both feet hangin’ out over the edge
Of the water tower skyline
At least there's a little bit of sweet in the bitter
Though a part of me is always gonna miss her
I am who I am, I just miss who I was when we were
Mmm, yes, I do

[Outro]
My friends say
""Oh well, let that ship sail
You gotta let go of her""
Just wasn't meant to be
But somewhere down deep, I still believe
That we were"
Keith Urban,Texas Time,"[Verse 1]
New York girls, they can be so pretty
But I get cold livin' in the city, oh
Then I've got to go
And I've been west out to California
Summer nights and girls are so much warmer there
They just don't have a care
But I know a place where the people are smilin'
Takin' it easy and it's been a while since I've gone
And now it's time to go home

[Chorus]
Give me a tight t-shirt on a real hot body
You know what's on my mind
Yeah, I'll show you where it's at
Come on, let's get back on Texas time
You gotta rock me easy, we're gonna party
Whiskey, women and wine
Yeah, I'll show you where it's at
Come on, let's get back on Texas time

[Verse 2]
I-35, Dallas down to Austin
We can find a world we can get lost in there
Where we can breathe the air, oh, oh
We can howl at the moon like a wild coyote
Cactus in bloom and the pink peyote's so fine
So fine, we got nothin' but time, hee

[Chorus]
Give me a tight t-shirt on a real hot body
You know what's on my mind
Yeah, I'll show you where it's at
Come on, let's get back on Texas time
You gotta rock me easy, we're gonna party
Whiskey, women and wine
Yeah, I'll show you where it's at
Come on, let's get back on Texas time

[Bridge]
And I know a place where the people are real
And they're takin' it easy and makin' you feel right at home
Yeah, that's where I'm going, hee

[Chorus]
Give me a tight t-shirt on a real hot body
You know what's on my mind
Yeah, I'll show you where it's at
Come on, let's get back on Texas time
You gotta rock me easy, we're gonna party
Whiskey, women and wine
Yeah, I'll show you where it's at
Come on, let's get back on Texas time

[Outro]
Woah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, baby
And so fine, mmm, mmm
Do it to me every time
You do it to me
And you do it to me, baby, oh
Hey
Ooh, and the women so fine
Hey, hey, hey
Oh, won't you get back
Wanna get back?
Woo!"
Keith Urban,MESSED UP AS ME,"[Verse 1]
When I get blue, I get dark blue
When I have one, I always have a few
When I get gone, I get real gone
When I get it wrong, I get it real wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm out tonight
And I'm feelin' like I should call you up
Maybe take a shot that you're wide awake at a quarter to 3
Maybe lookin' through your camera roll
The tequila's startin' to take a toll
I was hopin', baby, maybe you'd be

[Chorus]
As messed up as me and all alone
And all of your friends have all gone home
And you hatе that the truth is nobody leaves your hеad and your heart
And your bed and your sheets as messed up as me
As messed up as me

[Verse 2]
When you get mad, you stay that way
And you always say you're doin' okay
But we both know it's probably a lie
And you're fallin' to pieces on the inside

[Pre-Chorus]
And you're out tonight like you always are
You're dressed to kill and your lips are red
And misery still loves company

[Chorus]
Are you as messed up as me and all alone?
And all of your friends have all gone home
And you hate that the truth is nobody leaves your head and your heart
And your bed and your sheets as messed up as

[Bridge]
Me and you (Me and you)
When we used to (We used to)
Paint this town, burn it down and go 'round for round for 'round
Hey, what are you doin' right now?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm out tonight
And I'm feelin' like I should call you up
Maybe take a shot that you're wide awake at a quarter to 3

[Chorus]
As messed up as me and all alone
And all of your friends have all gone home
And you hate that the truth is nobody leaves your head and your heart
And your bed and your sheets as messed up as me
As messed up as me
Oh, what are you doin' right now?"
Keith Urban,Cop Car,"[Verse 1]
We drove right past that no trespassing sign
We sat on the tailgate and watched the planes take off
We thought we had all night, there was no need to rush
That's when those cops came pulling up
And I thought
Man, ain't this some sh—

[Pre-Chorus]
Your daddy's gonna kill me
But if I survive tonight
I wouldn't change one thing
Baby, yeah, I know it sounds crazy

[Chorus]
But there was something 'bout the way the blue lights were shining
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes
I was too busy watching you going wild child
To be worried about going to jail
You were thinking that running for it would make a good story
I was thinking you were crazy as hell
And you were so innocent, but you were stealing my heart
I fell in love in the back of a cop car

[Verse 2]
Man, they weren't playing, they sure threw those cuffs on quick
You tried to sweet talk 'em, they didn't fall for it, but I did
You were on the left, I was on the right
I knew you didn't smoke when you asked him for a light
And I laughed
He got mad and slammed the door

[Pre-Chorus]
I swear your daddy's gonna kill me
But if I survive tonight
I wouldn't change one thing
Baby, yeah, I know it sounds crazy

[Chorus]
But there was something 'bout the way the blue lights were shining
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes
I was too busy watching you going wild child
To be worried about going to jail
You were thinking that running for it would make a good story
I was thinking you were crazy as hell
And you were so innocent, but you were stealing my heart
I fell in love in the back of a cop car

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh-woah-oh)
Oh, and you were like (Oh-woah-oh)

[Bridge]
Side by side and locked in tight
They were taking their time, but we didn't mind
We talked and we laughed, we sat real close
By the time they let us go
I was already gone (Yeah)

[Chorus]
But there was something 'bout the way the blue lights were shining
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes
I was too busy watching you going wild child
To be worried about going to jail
You were thinking that running for it would make a good story
I was thinking you were crazy as hell
And you were so innocent, but you were stealing my heart
I fell in love in the back of a cop car

(Oh-woah-oh)
I fell in love in the back of a cop car

They were taking their time, but we didn't mind
We talked and we laughed, we sat real close

I was already gone, baby (Oh-woah-oh)
I fell in love in the back of a cop car

Trisha Yearwood,How Do I Live (Without You),"How do I
Get through one night without you?
If I had to live without you
What kind of life would that be?
Oh now
I need you in my arms need you to hold
You're my world my heart my soul
If you ever leave
Baby you would take away everything good in my life

Without you
There'd be no sun in my sky
There would be no love in my life
There'd be no world left for me
And I, baby I don't know what I would do
I'd be lost if I lost you
If you ever leave
Baby you would take away everything real in my life
And tell me now

How do I live without you?
I want to know
How do I breathe without you?
If you ever go
How do I ever, ever survive?
How do I, how do I, oh how do I live?

If you ever leave
Baby you would take away everything
I need you with me
Baby 'cause you know that you're everything
Good in my life
And tell me now

How do I live without you
I want to know
How do I breathe without you?
If you ever go
How do I ever, ever survive?
How do I, how do I, oh how do I live?
How do I live, without you baby"
Trisha Yearwood,She’s in Love with the Boy,"[Verse 1]
Katie's sittin' on her old front porch
Watchin' the chickens peck the ground
There ain't a whole lot goin' on tonight
In this one-horse town

[Verse 2]
Over yonder comin' up the road in a beat-up Chevy truck
Her boyfriend Tommy, he's layin' on the horn
Splashin' through the mud and the muck

[Bridge]
Her daddy says ""he ain't worth a lick""
""When it comes to brains he got the short end of the stick""
But Katie's young and man, she just don't care
She'd follow Tommy anywhere

[Chorus]
She's in love with the boy
She's in love with the boy
She's in love with the boy
And even if they have to run away
She's gonna marry that boy someday

[Verse 3]
Katie and Tommy at the drive-in movie
Parked in the very last row
They're too busy holdin' on to one another
To even care about the show

[Verse 4]
Later on outside the Tastee Freeze
Tommy slips something on her hand
He says ""my high school ring will have to do
'Til I can buy a wedding band""

[Bridge]
Her daddy says ""he ain't worth a lick""
""When it comes to brains he got the short end of the stick""
But Katie's young and man, she just don't care
She'd follow Tommy anywhere

She's in love with the boy
She's in love with the boy
And even if they have to run away
She's gonna marry that boy someday

[Verse 5]
Her daddy's waitin' up 'til half past twelve
When they come sneakin' up the walk
He says ""young lady get on up to your room
While me and Junior have a talk""

[Verse 6]
Mama breaks in, says ""don't lose your temper
It wasn't very long ago
When you yourself was just a hayseed plowboy
Who didn't have a row to hoe""

[Bridge 2]
My daddy said ""you wasn't worth a lick""
""When it came to brains, you got the short end of the stick""
""But he was wrong and honey you are too
Katie looks at Tommy like I still look at you""

She's in love with the boy
She's in love with the boy
She's in love with the boy
What's meant to be will always find a way

She's in love with the boy
She's in love with the boy
She's in love with the boy
What's meant to be will always find a way
She's gonna marry that boy someday

[Outro]
She's in love with the boy"
Trisha Yearwood,XXX’s and OOO’s (An American Girl),"[Verse1 ]
Phone rings, baby cries, TV diet, guru lies
Good morning honey
Go to work, make up, try to keep the balance up
Between love and money

[Chorus]
She used to tie her hair up in ribbons and bows
Sign her letters with X's and O's
Got a picture of her mama in heels and pearls
She's gonna make it in her daddy's world
She's an American girl
An American girl

[Verse 2]
Slow dance
Second chance
Mama needs romance
And an live-in maid
Fix the sink
Mow the yard
Really isn't all that hard
If you get paid

[Chorus]
She used to tie her hair up in ribbons and bows
Sign her letters with X's and O's
Got a picture of her mama in heels and pearls
She's gonna make it in her daddy's world
She's an American girl
An American girl
Well, she's got her God
And she's got good wine
Aretha Franklin and Patsy Cline

[Chorus]
She used to tie her hair up in ribbons and bows
Sign her letters with X's and O's
Got a picture of her mama in heels and pearls
She's gonna make it in her daddy's world
She's an American girl
An American girl
She's an American girl

[Chorus]
She used to tie her hair up in ribbons and bows
Sign her letters with X’s and O’s
Got a picture of her mama in heels and pearls
She's gonna make it in her daddy's world
Well, she tied her hair up in ribbons and bows
Sign her letters with X’s and O’s
X’s and O’s
X’s and O’s"
Trisha Yearwood,For the Last Time,"God knows I've known some lovers in my storied past
But those and all the others they just didn't last
And now I know why for the first time I'm in love
For the last time

My love was like a lyric with no melody
And words are only words if there's no poetry
Now I've found my rhyme for the first time I'm in love
For the last time

So many bridges burned
Without a lesson learned
I thought that I had earned this life alone
But through God's saving grace
And the beauty of your face
My heart has found a place to call my own

I never thought forever'd ever be for me
I could only guess that happiness wasn't meant to be
But now both are mine for the first time I'm in love
For the last time

So many bridges burned
Without a lesson learned
I thought that I had earned this life alone
But through God's saving grace
And the beauty of your face
My heart has found a place to call my own

I never thought forever'd ever be for me
I could only guess that happiness wasn't meant to be
But now both are mine for the first time I'm in love
For the last time

For the first time
I'm in love for the last time"
Trisha Yearwood,I’ll Carry You Home,"[Verse 1]
When you can't walk and there's chains 'round your soul
The burden's too heavy and you've run out of road
And you're praying out loud
As you stumble through the rain and snow
I'll walk out and find you, I'll carry you home

[Verse 2]
When you can't speak 'cause the words are too strong
And every time that you try, it just comes out all wrong
When your heart's screaming out, but no one can hear your song
Oh, I'll sing it for you, I'll carry you home

[Chorus]
I'll carry you home, I'll carry you home
So rest your heart easy, I'll carry you home

[Verse 3]
So wander this world now, fearless and free
Climb every mountain and sail every sea
But if you wander too far into the great unknown
You know I will find you, I'll carry you home

[Chorus]
I'll carry you home, I'll carry you home
So rest your heart easy, I'll carry you home
I'll carry you home, I'll carry you home
So rest your heart easy, I'll carry you home
Rest your heart easy, I'll carry you home"
Trisha Yearwood,Walkaway Joe,"[Verse 1]
Mama told her baby, ""Girl, take it real slow""
Girl told her mama, ""Hey, I really gotta go
He's waitin' in the car""
Mama said, ""Girl, you won't get far""

[Verse 2]
Thus are the dreams of an average Jane
Ninety miles an hour down a lover's lane
On a tank of dreams
Oh, if she could have only seen

[Pre-Chorus]
But fate's got cards that it don't wanna show

[Chorus]
And that boy's just a walkaway Joe
Born to be a leaver, tell you from the word go
Destined to deceive her, he's the wrong kind of paradise
She's gonna know it in a matter of time
That boy's just a walkaway Joe

[Verse 3]
Now just a little while into Abilene
Pulls into a station and he robs it clean
She's waitin' in the car
Underneath the Texaco star

[Verse 4]
She only wanted love, didn't bargain for this
She can't help but love him for the way he is
She's only seventeen
And there ain't no reasoning

[Pre-Chorus]
So she'll ride this ride as far as it can go

[Chorus]
'Cause that boy's just a walkaway Joe
Born to be a leaver, tell you from the word go
Destined to deceive her, he's the wrong kind of paradise
She's gonna know it in a matter of time
That boy's just a walkaway Joe

[Verse 5]
Somewhere in a roadside motel room
Alone in the silence, she wakes up too soon
And reaches for his arms
But she'll just keep reachin' on

[Pre-Chorus]
For the cold hard truth revealed what it had known

[Chorus]
That boy's just a walkaway Joe
Born to be a leaver, tell you from the word go
Destined to deceive her, he's the wrong kind of paradise
But it was just another lesson in life
That boy was a walkaway Joe

[Outro]
All he was was a walkaway Joe
Ooh, walkaway Joe
Ooh, he was a walkaway Joe
Ooh, walkaway Joe
Yes, he was a walkaway Joe"
Trisha Yearwood,The Woman Before Me,"[Verse 1]
I can see you turn away
When I ask what for
You say it isn't anything
But I'm not sure
Something underneath the skin
Won't let you be
And you try to keep it in
But I can see

[Chorus]
The woman before me
Must have been hard on you
'Cause that hurt in your eyes
I never put you through
Sometimes I think you must be talkin' to
The woman before me and you

[Verse 2]
Sometimes in an argument
It will show
When you go a little farther than
You meant to go
I know you don't mean the things
That you say
I just wanna ease the pain
That's in your way

[Chorus]
The woman before me
Must have been hard on you
'Cause that hurt in your eyes
I never put you through
Sometimes I think you must be talkin' to
The woman before me and you

[Bridge]
If there are sorrows that bring back a tear
Don't let them keep us apart
You ought to know you've got nothing to fear
Here in my heart

[Verse 3]
'Cause you and I will never be
Like the past
Whatever kind of memories
That you have
Nothin's gonna hurt you now
Can't you see
I already made a vow
That I can keep

[Chorus]
The woman before me
Must have been hard on you
'Cause that hurt in your eyes
I never put you through
Sometimes I think you must be talkin' to
The woman before me and you

[Tag]
Sometimes I think you must be talkin' to
The woman before me and you"
Trisha Yearwood,Love You Anyway,"[Verse 1: Trisha Yearwood]
You were the light that wounds the eye
The pain that time could not deny
I felt resistance fading fast
As if you saved the heart for last
I knew right then, no matter what
That this would take all that I've got
There's really nothing I could do
Oh, this much in love with you

[Chorus: Trisha Yearwood & Don Henley]
So break my faith, forget my name
Either way, it's all the same
You're my first word, my last breath
My will to live when nothing's left
Tear this heart right out of me
Lock it up, then lose the key
Curse my name when you kneel to pray
I'm gonna love you anyway

[Verse 2]
I toss and turn helplessly
There's nothin' no one can do for me
You're the first thought in my soul
There's no regaining my control
And should one day I stand accused
By other loves I have refused
When hope is gone and I am weak
You are the last name I will speak

[Chorus: Trisha Yearwood & Don Henley]
So break my faith, forget my name
Either way, it's all the same
You're my first word, my last breath
My will to live when nothing's left
Tear this heart right out of me
Lock it up, then lose the key
Curse my name when you kneel to pray
I'm gonna love you anyway
I'm gonna love you anyway"
Trisha Yearwood,Shallow (The Duet With Garth Brooks),"[Verse 1: Garth Brooks]
Tell me somethin', girl
Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?

[Pre-Chorus: Garth Brooks]
I'm fallin'
And in the good times, I find myself longin'
For a change
And in the bad times, I fear myself

[Verse 2: Trisha Yearwood]
Tell me somethin', boy
Aren't you tired tryna fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?

[Pre-Chorus: Trishia Yearwood]
I'm fallin'
And in the good times, I find myself longin'
For a change
And in the bad times, I fear myself

[Chorus: Trisha Yearwood, Trishia Yearwood & Garth Brooks]
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through thе surface, where thеy can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now
In the sha-ha, sha-hallow
In the sha, sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha, sha-hallow
We're far from the shallow now

[Bridge: Trisha Yearwood]
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh

[Chorus: Trisha Yearwood, Trishia Yearwood & Garth Brooks]
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now
In the sha-ha, sha-hallow
In the sha, sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha, sha-hallow
We're far from the shallow now
We're far from the shallow now"
Trisha Yearwood,The Song Remembers When,"[Verse 1]
I was standin' at the counter
I was waitin' for the change
When I heard that old familiar music start
It was like a lighted match
Had been tossed into my soul
It was like a dam had broken in my heart

[Chorus]
After taking every detour
Gettin' lost and losin' track
So that even if I wanted
I could not find my way back
After drivin' out the memory
Of the way things might have been
After I'd forgotten all about us
The song remembers when

[Verse 2]
We were rollin' through the Rockies
We were up above the clouds
When a station out of Jackson played that song
And it seemed to fit the moment
And the moment seemed to freeze
When we turned the music up and sang along

[Chorus]
And there was a God in Heaven
And the world made perfect sense
We were young and were in love
And we were easy to convince
We were headed straight for Eden
It was just around the bend
And though I have forgotten all about it
The song remembers when

[Bridge]
I guess something must have happened
And we must have said goodbye
And my heart must have been broken
Though I can't recall just why
The song remembers when

[Verse 3]
Well, for all the miles between us
And for all the time that's passed
You would think I haven't gotten very far
And I hope my hasty heart
Will forgive me just this once
If I stop to wonder how on Earth you are

[Chorus]
But that's just a lot of water
Underneath a bridge I burned
And there's no use in backtracking
Around corners I have turned
Still I guess some things we bury
Are just bound to rise again
For even if the whole world has forgotten
The song remembers when
Yeah, and even if the whole world has forgotten
The song remembers when"
Trisha Yearwood,The Dreaming Fields,"Oh, the sun rolls down, big as a miracle
And fades from the Midwest Sky
And the corn and the trees wave in the breeze
As if to say goodbye
Oh, my grandfather stood right here as a younger man
In nineteen and forty three
And with the sweat and his tears, the rain and the years
He grew life from the soil and seed

Oh I'm goin' down to the dreaming fields
But what will be my harvest now
Where every tear that falls on a memory
Feels like rain on the rusted plow
Rain on the rusted plow

And these fields they dream of wheat in the summertime
Grandchildren running free
And the bales of hay at the end of the day
And the scarecrow that just scared me
Now the houses they grow like weeds in a flower bed
This morning the silo fell
Seems the only way a man can live off the land these days
Is to buy and sell

So I'm goin' down to the dreaming fields
But what will be my harvest now
Where every tear that falls on a memory
Feels like rain on the rusted plow
Rain on the rusted plow

Like the rain on the roof on the porch by the kitchen
Where as my grandmother sings, I can hear if I listen
Running down, running down to the end of the world I loved
This will be my harvest now

And the sun rolls down, big as a miracle
And fades in the Midwest sky
And the corn and the trees wave in the breeze
As if to say goodbye"
Trisha Yearwood,I Would’ve Loved You Anyway,"If I'd a-known the way that this would end
If I'd a-read the last page first
If I'd a-had the strength to walk away
If I'd a-known how this would hurt

I would've loved you anyway
I'd do it all the same
Not a second I would change
Not a touch that I would trade
Had I known my heart would break
I'd a-loved you anyway

It's bittersweet to look back now
At mem'ries withered on the vine
But just to hold you close to me
For a moment in time

I would've loved you anyway
I'd do it all the same
Not a second I would change
Not a touch that I would trade
Had I known my heart would break
I'd a-loved you anyway

And even if I'd seen it coming
You'd still've seen me running
Straight into your arms

I would've loved you anyway
I'd do it all the same
Not a second I would change
Not a touch that I would trade
Had I known my heart would break
I would've loved you anyway

I would've loved you anyway"
Trisha Yearwood,Like We Never Had a Broken Heart,"[Verse 1: Trisha Yearwood]
Don't be afraid to hold me tight
You know I won't break in two
What we're doing here tonight
Sure beats what we're goin' through

[Pre-Chorus: Trisha Yearwood & Garth Brooks]
We've both loved and lost before
You know the sadness it can bring
Tonight let's close the door
And hold on to the nearest thing

[Chorus: Trisha Yearwood & Garth Brooks, Trisha]
Let's keep hanging on
So we won't fall apart
Let's make love tonight
Like we never had a broken heart

[Verse 2: Trisha Yearwood]
Don't be afraid to close your eyes
Pretend I'm someone that you love
And I won't have to tell you lies
'Cause it's not you I'm thinkin' of

[Chorus: Trisha Yearwood & Garth Brooks, Trisha]
Let's keep hanging on
So we won't fall apart
Let's make love tonight
Like we never had a broken heart

[Instrumental]

[Outro: Trisha Yearwood & Garth Brooks, Trisha]
Tonight we'll just pretend
We've been in love right from the start
Let's make love again
Like we never had a broken heart
Oh, let's make love again
Like we never had a broken heart
Don't be afraid to close your eyes"
Trisha Yearwood,Georgia Rain,"[Verse 1]
Barefoot in the bed 'a your truck
On a blanket, lookin' up
Half a moon peekin' down at us
From underneath the clouds
Teenage kids sneakin' out again
Heard the thunder rollin' in
We were fallin' the moment when
It all came pourin' down

[Chorus]
The Georgia rain
On the Jasper County clay
Couldn't wash away
What I felt for you that day
Just you and me down an old dirt road
Nothin' in our way
Except for the Georgia rain

[Verse 2]
Cotton fields remember when
Flash 'a lightnin' drove us in
We were soaked down to the skin
By the time we climbed inside
And I don't remember what was poundin' more
Heart in my chest or the hood of that Ford
As the sky fell in, the storm clouds poured
Worlds away outside

[Chorus]
The Georgia rain
On the Jasper County clay
Couldn't wash away
All the love we made
Just you and me down that old dirt road
No one saw a thing
Except for the Georgia rain

[Verse 3]
Screen door flappin' in the wind
Same ol' house I grew up in
Can't believe I'm back again
After all these years away
You fixed your Daddy's house up nice
I saw it yesterday when I drove by
Looks like you've made youself a real good life
What else can I say?

[Chorus]
The Georgia rain
On the Jasper County clay
Couldn't wash away
The way I loved you to this day
The ol' dirt road's paved over now
Nothin' here's the same
Except for the Georgia rain
Couldn't wash away
The way I loved you to this day
Just you and me down an old dirt road
Nothin' in our way
Except for the Georgia rain"
Trisha Yearwood,Broken,"[Verse 1]
The broken clock is a comfort, it helps me sleep tonight
Maybe it can stop tomorrow from stealing all my time
I am here still waiting though i still have my doubts
I am damaged at best, like you've already figured out

[Chorus]
I'm falling apart, I'm barely breathing
With a broken heart that's still beating
In the pain, there is healing
In your name I find meaning

[Verse 2]
The broken lights were a warning you got inside my head
I tried my best to be guarded, I'm an open book instead
I still see your reflection inside of my eyes
That are looking for a purpose, they're still looking for life

I'm falling apart, I'm barely breathing
With a broken heart that's still beating
In the pain, oh, is there healing
In your name I find meaning

I'm hanging on another day
Just to see what you throw my way
And I'm hanging on

The broken lights on the freeway
Left me here alone
I may have lost my way now
Haven't forgotten my way home

I'm falling apart, I'm barely breathing
With a broken heart that's still beating
In the pain, oh, is there healing
In your name I find meaning
So I'm holding, I'm holding on
Yeah I'm holding on
I'm barely holding on to you"
Trisha Yearwood,I Remember You,"I can picture you, like a photograph
I can see your smile
I can hear your laugh
No I don't have to look back
I remember you

When I'm all alone
You're all around
I tell you things, yeah I talk out loud
Ever since you left the ground
I remember you

You can ask the sun
You can ask the moon
Every day that goes by
I remember you

And even when
I close my eyes
Like a dream, you come back to life
I can't escape your love, your light
I remember you

You can ask the sun
You can ask the moon, yeah
Every day that goes by
I remember you

And I know some day
Only God knows when
I'll touch your face
And I'll breathe again
And life goes on, so until then
I remember you

Yeah, I remember you
Mmmmmmm
Every day that goes by
Oooooh
I remember you"
Trisha Yearwood,That’s What I Like About You,"I like a man who's crazy about me
I like a man who can live without me too
That's what I like about you

I like a man who will lay down beside me
I like a man who will stand up to me too
That's what I like about you

I don't want a man to be my twin
Under my thumb, under my skin
Don't want a man like a shadow on the ground
With nothin' else to do but follow me around

I like a man who will cry on my shoulder
Who don't mind if I cry sometimes too
That's what I like about you

I like a man who can make it happen
Who can get me laughin' when my whole world breaks in two
That's what I like about you

You can be soft honey, you can be strong
Maybe that's the reason we get along
Everything you do you do just right
You're tender in love, tought in a fight

I like a man who will lay down beside me
Stand up to me, cry on my shoulder, crazy about me
Can live with out me too
That's what I like about
Can't live my life without
That's what I like about you"
Trisha Yearwood,Down on My Knees,"[Verse 1]
Sometimes you wonder how much I care
I get so distracted, running nowhere
And I take for granted our love is secure
But if I started losing you, one thing is sure

[Chorus]
I'd be down on my knees, ready to pray
Darling, down on my knees, making you stay
I'd be begging you please, don't take your love from me
I'd be down on my knees

[Verse 2]
I learned to be strong a long time ago
And I can face any wind, no matter how hard it blows
But I'd have to be stronger than I want to be
If I had to live without you loving me

[Chorus]
I'd be down on my knees, ready to pray
Darling, down on my knees, making you stay
I'd be begging you please, don't take your love from me
I'd be down on my knees

[Verse 3]
No one matters more in my life
Or makes me feel like you make me feel inside
And I've come far enough to know
Love's worth never letting go of
And love is not a matter of pride

[Chorus]
I'd be down on my knees, ready to pray
Darling, down on my knees, whatever it takes
I'd be begging and pleading with you
Don't take your love from me
I'd be down on my knees"
Trisha Yearwood,Wrong Side of Memphis,"[Chorus]
I've been livin' on the wrong side of Memphis
I'm really breaking away this time
A full tank of gas and a '69 Tempest
Takin' me to that Nashville sign

[Verse 1]
No turning back, I've come too far
Headed down 40 with my old guitar
This ain't Graceland, well, that's a fact
And I ain't driving no pink Cadillac

[Chorus]
I've been livin' on the wrong side of Memphis
Gonna bronze these blue suede shoes
These cowboy boots are gettin' kinda restless
They ain't got a single thing to lose

[Verse 2]
I've had this dream from a tender age
Callin' my name from the Opry stage
I can hear it singin' loud and clear
Two hundred miles and I'll be there

[Chorus]
I've been livin' on the wrong side of Memphis
I'm really breaking away this time
A full tank of gas and a '69 Tempest
Taking me to that Nashville sign
Yes, I've been livin' on the wrong side of Memphis
Gonna bronze these blue suede shoes
These cowboy boots are gettin' kinda restless
They ain't got a single thing to lose

[Outro]
I've been livin' on the wrong side of Memphis
I've been livin' on the wrong side of Memphis
I got the cowboy boots
Rhinestone suit
I've been livin' on the wrong side of Memphis
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Full tank of gas and a '69 Tempest
Takin' me to that Nashville sign"
Trisha Yearwood,What Gave Me Away,"[Verse 1: Trisha Yearwood]
Was it the way you caught me staring
Or the dress that I was wearing that told you so?
Was it the way that I was stumbling my words
When I was trying to speak?
Did you know I was in trouble
When I ordered up a double
And I barely even drank?
Was it written on my face?
What gave me away?

[Verse 2: Trisha Yearwood & Garth Brooks]
Was it the way I hung around
While the band was breaking down?
It was 3 AM
Or when we finally left the bar
When you walked me to my car
Did you know?
And when we stood there in the silence
And the parking lot was quiet
Was my cover blown?
How long did it take?
What gave me away?

[Chorus: Trisha Yearwood & Garth Brooks, Trisha Yearwood]
And did you see it when it hit me?
Feel it when you kissed me
All night long?
Was it when you took me home
And I woke up in the morning
With your t-shirt on?
Baby, did you know all along?

[Verse 3: Trisha Yearwood & Garth Brooks]
I was sweating, I was shaking
Every breath that I was taking
Every time we met
Was it obvious that I was blind
To everybody else in the room?
And could you tell my heart was racing?
I was falling, it was aching
Couldn't keep my cool
Tell me, what did I say?
What gave me away?

[Chorus: Trisha Yearwood & Garth Brooks, Trisha Yearwood]
Ooh, did you see it when it hit me?
Feel it when you kissed me
All night long?
Was it when you took me home
And I woke up in the morning
With your t-shirt on?
Baby, did you know all along?

[Outro: Trisha Yearwood with Garth Brooks]
Did I ever have you guessing?
Did you know it from the second
I walked in the room?
Was it written on my face?
What gave me away?"
Trisha Yearwood,You’re Where I Belong,"I am home now, home now
I've been waiting for forever to find you
To find you
I'm not alone now, alone now
'Cause you've taken in my heart from the cold
All I know is every time
I look into your eyes
I'm home, I know

You're where I belong
I belong with you
You're where I belong
And I know it's the truth
You're part of my heart
There's nothing I can do
Oh, you're the one that keeps me warm
My baby, you're where I belong

You're my first taste, my first taste
Of the sweetest feeling I've ever known
That I've known
You're my safe place, my safe place
From a world that can be so cruel and cold
You're my harbor, you're my shelter
You're that welcome smile
That lets me know I'm home

You're where I belong
I belong with you
You're where I belong
And I know it's the truth
You're part of my heart
There's nothing I can do
Oh, you're the one that keeps me warm
My baby, you're where I belong

You're the one I come to
To keep me from the cold

You're where I belong
I belong with you
You're where I belong
And I know it's the truth
You're part of my heart
There's nothing I can do
Oh, you're the one that keeps me warm
My baby, you're where I belong

You're where I belong
You're where I belong
You're where I belong

I am home now
Home now"
Trisha Yearwood,You’ll Never Walk Alone,"When you walk through a storm hold your head up high
And don't be afraid of the dark
At the end of a storm is a golden sky
And the sweet silver song of a lark

Walk on through the wind
Walk on through the rain
Though your dreams be tossed and blown

Walk on, walk on with a hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never, ever walk alone

Walk on, walk on with a hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never, ever walk alone"
Trisha Yearwood,This Is Me You’re Talking To,"This was bound to happen
It was just a matter of time
This town is just too small for
Us to really say goodbye
You're smiling that smile that
You get when you're nervous
Like you don't quite know what to do
But this is me you're talking to
This is me you're talking to

I've heard you met somebody
It didn't take you very long
And I'll admit it isn't easy
Knowing you've moved on
But I can see how you could make any woman
Fall deep in love with you
This is me you're talking to

Me, the one who really knows you
Me, the one whose heart you've broken
Me, the one who was still hopin'
You might be missing me

We don't have to do this
We don't have to act like friends
As much as I would love to
I really just don't think I can
You don't have to tell me that you really love me
After all we have been through
'Cause this is me you're talking to

Me, the one who really knows you
Me, the one whose heart you've broken
Me, the one who was still hopin'
You might be missing me

Oh, and you don't have to say that you do
This is me you're talking to
This is me you're talking to"
Trisha Yearwood,There Goes My Baby,"[Verse 1]
He was the kind of guy who loved so unselfishly
And everyone could see what a prize he was
Everyone but me
I must be blind
I must be the kind who don't know what they have
'Til they're all alone and sad

[Chorus]
There goes my baby
Like the sun fallin' out of the clear blue sky
There goes my baby
And it's gonna be a cold hard night
Now that I finally see
How I need him to be
Right here by my side
There goes my baby
Bye-bye baby, goodbye

[Verse 2]
How could I have a love so fine
And not know what it's worth?
Maybe this empty heart he left behind is all that I deserve
What kind of fool finds a perfect jewel and can't see how it shines?
'Til she's all alone and cryin'

[Chorus]
There goes my baby
Like the sun fallin' out of the clear blue sky
There goes my baby
And it's gonna be a cold hard night
Now that I finally see
How I need him to be
Right here by my side
There goes my baby
Bye-bye baby, goodbye

[Bridge]
How I wish I could hold him in my arms and say
This time I'm gonna treat him right
But it's too late

[Chorus]
There goes my baby
Like the sun fallin' out of the clear blue sky
There goes my baby
And it's gonna be a cold hard night
Now that I finally see
How I need him to be
Right here by my side
There goes my baby
Bye-bye baby, goodbye
Bye-bye baby, goodbye
Bye-bye baby, goodbye"
Trisha Yearwood,I Won’t Give Up,"[Verse 1]
When I look into your eyes
It's like watching the night sky
Or a beautiful sunrise
Well there's so much they hold
And just like them old stars
I see that you've come so far
To be right where you are
How old is your soul?

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And when you're needing your space
To do some navigating
I'll be here patiently waiting
To see what you find

[Chorus]
Cause even the stars they burn
Some even fall to the earth
We've got a lot to learn
God knows we're worth it
No, I won't give up

[Bridge]
I don't wanna be someone who walks away so easily
I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make
Our differences they do a lot to teach us how to use the tools and gifts
We got yeah we got a lot at stake
And in the end
You're still my friend at least we didn't tend
For us to work we didn't break, we didn't burn
We had to learn, how to bend without the world caving in
I had to learn what I got, and what I'm not
And who I am

[Chorus 2]
I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up
I'm still looking up

[Chorus 3]
I won't give up on us
God knows I'm tough, he knows
We got a lot to learn
God knows we're worth it

[Chorus 4]
I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up"
Martina McBride,Concrete Angel,"[Verse 1]
She walks to school with the lunch she packed
Nobody knows what she's holdin' back
Wearin' the same dress she wore yesterday
She hides the bruises with linen and lace

[Verse 2]
The teacher wonders, but she doesn't ask
It's hard to see the pain behind the mask
Bearin' the burden of a secret storm
Sometimes she wishes she was never born

[Chorus]
Through the wind and the rain
She stands hard as a stone
In a world that she can't rise above
But her dreams give her wings
And she flies to a place where she's loved
Concrete angel

[Verse 3]
Somebody cries in the middle of the night
The neighbours hear, but they turn out the light
A fragile soul caught in the hands of fate
When mornin' comes it'll be too late

[Chorus]
Through the wind and the rain
She stands hard as a stone
In a world that she can't rise above
But her dreams give her wings
And she flies to a place where she's loved
Concrete angel

[Verse 3]
A statue stands in a shaded place
An angel girl with an upturned face
A name is written on a polished rock
A broken heart that the world forgot

[Chorus]
Through the wind and the rain
She stands hard as a stone
In a world that she can't rise above
But her dreams give her wings
And she flies to a place where she's loved
Concrete angel"
Martina McBride,Independence Day,"[Verse 1]
Well, she seemed alright by dawn's early light
Though she looked a little worried and weak
She tried to pretend he wasn't drinkin' again
But daddy left the proof on her cheek
And I was only eight years old that summer
And I always seemed to be in the way
So, I took myself down to the fair in town
On Independence Day

[Verse 2]
Well, word gets around in a small, small town
They said he was a dangerous man
But mama was proud and she stood her ground
She knew she was on the losin' end
Some folks whispered, some folks talked
But everybody looked the other way
When time ran out there was no one about
On Independence Day

[Chorus]
Let freedom ring
Let the white dove sing
Let the whole world know that today
Is a day of reckoning
Let the weak be strong
Let the right be wrong
Roll the stone away
Let the guilty pay
It's Independence Day

[Verse 3]
Well she lit up the sky that fourth of July
By the time that the firemen come
They just put out the flames and took down some names
And sent me to the county home
Now, I ain't sayin' it's right or it's wrong
But maybe it's the only way
Talk about your revolution
It's Independence Day

[Chorus]
Let freedom ring
Let the white dove sing
Let the whole world know that today
Is a day of reckoning
Let the weak be strong
Let the right be wrong
Roll the stone away
Let the guilty pay
It's Independence Day

[Outro]
Roll the stone away
It's Independence Day"
Martina McBride,This One’s for the Girls,"[Verse 1]
This is for all you girls about thirteen
High school can be so rough, can be so mean
Hold on to, on to your innocence
Stand your ground when everybody's giving in
This one's for the girls

[Verse 2]
This is for all you girls about twenty-five
In little apartments, just trying to get by
Living on, on dreams and Spaghetti-O's
Wondering where your life is gonna go

[Chorus]
This one's for the girls
Who've ever had a broken heart
Who've wished upon a shooting star
You're beautiful the way you are
This one's for the girls
Who love without holding back
Who dream with everything they have
All around the world
This one's for the girls
(This one's for all the girls)

[Verse 3]
This is for all you girls about forty-two
Tossing pennies into the fountain of youth
Every laugh, laugh line on your face
Made you who you are today

[Chorus]
This one's for the girls
Who've ever had a broken heart
Who've wished upon a shooting star
You're beautiful the way you are
This one's for the girls
Who love without holding back
Who dream with everything they have
All around the world
This one's for the girls

[Bridge]
Yeah, we're all the same inside (Same inside)
From one to ninety-nine

[Chorus]
This one's for the girls
Who've ever had a broken heart
Who've wished upon a shooting star
You're beautiful the way you are
This one's for the girls
Who love without holding back
Who dream with everything they have
All around the world, yeah
This one's for the girls (This one's for all the girls)
Yeah, this one's for the girls (This one's for all the girls)"
Martina McBride,A Broken Wing,"[Verse 1]
She loved him like he was
The last man on Earth
Gave him everything she ever had
He'd break her spirit down
Then come loving up on her
Give a little, then take it back

[Verse 2]
She'd tell him 'bout her dreams
He'd just shoot 'em down
Lord, he loved to make her cry
""You're crazy for believing
You'll ever leave the ground""
He said, ""Only angels know how to fly""

[Chorus]
And with a broken wing
She still sings
She keeps an eye on the sky
With a broken wing (Ooh)
She carries her dreams
Man, you oughta see her fly

[Verse 3]
One Sunday morning
She didn't go to church
He wondered why she didn't leave
He went up to the bedroom
Found a note by the window
With the curtains blowin' in the breeze

[Chorus]
And with a broken wing
She still sings
She keeps an eye on the sky
With a broken wing (Ooh)
She carries her dreams
Man, you oughta see her fly
With a broken wing (Ooh)
She carries her dreams
Man, you oughta see her fly

[Outro]
(With a broken wing, ooh)"
Martina McBride,In My Daughter’s Eyes,"[Verse 1]
In my daughter's eyes I am a hero
I am strong and wise and I know no fear
But the truth is plain to see
She was sent to rescue me
I see who I want to be
In my daughter's eyes
In my daughter's eyes everyone is equal
Darkness turns to light and the
World is at peace
This miracle God gave to me
Gives me strength when I am weak
I find reason to believe
In my daughter's eyes
And when she wraps her hand around my finger
Oh it puts a smile in my heart
Everything becomes a little clearer
I realize what life is all about
It's hanging on when your heart has had enough
It's giving more when you feel like giving up
I've seen the light
It's in my daughter's eyes
In my daughter's eyes I can see the future
A reflection of who I am and what will be
Though she'll grow and someday leave
Maybe raise a family
When I'm gone I hope you see
How happy she made me
For I'll be there
In my daughter's eyes"
Martina McBride,I Love You (Single Version),"[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
The sun is shining everyday
The clouds never get in the way for you and me
I've known you just a week or two
But baby I'm so into you
Can hardly breathe

[Chorus 1]
And I'm in so totally wrapped up
Emotionally attracted
So physically acting
So recklessly I need you
So desperately sure as the sky is blue
Baby, I love you
I love you

[Verse 2]
I never knew that I could feel like this
Can hardly wait till our next kiss
You're so cool
If I'm dreaming, please don't wake me up
Because baby I can't get enough
Of what you do

[Chorus 2]
And I'm in so electrically charged up
Kinetically acting
Erratically need you
Fanatically you get to me
Magically sure as the sky is blue
Baby, I love you

[Bridge]
I, I can't believe that this is real
The way I feel
Baby, I'm gone head over heels
(Head over heels)

[Chorus 1]
And I'm in so totally wrapped up
Emotionally attracted
So physically acting
So recklessly I need you
So desperately sure as the sky is blue
Yeah

[Chorus 2]
And I'm in so electrically charged up
Kinetically acting
Erratically need you
Fanatically you get to me
Magically sure as the sky is blue
Baby, I love you

[Outro]
Baby, I love you
Do you love me too
Baby, I love you"
Martina McBride,I’m Gonna Love You Through It,"[Verse 1]
She dropped the phone and burst into tears
The doctor just confirmed her fears
Her husband held it in and held her tight
Cancer don't discriminate
Or care if you're just thirty-eight
With three kids who need you in their lives
He said, ""I know that you're afraid and I am, too
But you'll never be alone, I promise you""

[Chorus]
When you're weak, I'll be strong
When you let go, I'll hold on
And when you need to cry, I swear that I'll be there to dry your eyes
When you feel lost and scared to death
Like you can't take one more step
Just take my hand, together, we can do it
I'm gonna love you through it

[Verse 2]
She made it through the surgery fine
They said they caught it just in time
But they had to take more than they planned
And now it's forced smiles and baggy shirts
To hide what the cancer took from her
But she just wants to feel like a woman again
She said, ""I don't think I can do this anymore""
He took her in his arms and said ""That's what my love is for""

[Chorus]
When you're weak, I'll be strong
When you let go, I'll hold on
And when you need to cry, I swear that I'll be there to dry your eyes
When you feel lost and scared to death
Like you can't take one more step
Just take my hand, together, we can do it
I'm gonna love you through it
Oh, baby
Yeah, and when this road gets too long
I'll be the rock you lean on
Just take my hand, together we can do it
I'm gonna love you through it
I'm gonna love you through it
I'm gonna love you through it"
Martina McBride,Anyway,"You can spend your whole life buildin'
Somethin' from nothin'
One storm can come and blow it all away
Build it anyway

You can chase a dream
That seems so out of reach
And you know it might not ever come your way
Dream it anyway

God is great, but sometimes life ain't good
And when I pray
It doesn't always turn out like I think it should
But I do it anyway, I do it anyway

This world's gone crazy
And it's hard to believe
That tomorrow will be better than today
Believe it anyway

You can love someone with all your heart
For all the right reasons
And in a moment they can choose to walk away
Love 'em anyway

God is great
But sometimes life ain't good
And when I pray
It doesn't always turn out like I think it should
But I do it anyway
Yeah, I do it anyway

You can pour your soul out singin'
A song you believe in
That tomorrow they’ll forget you ever sang
Sing it anyway
Yeah, sing it anyway, yeah yeah

I sing, I dream, I love anyway, yeah"
Martina McBride,God’s Will,"[Verse 1]
I met God's Will on a Halloween night
He was dressed as a bag of leaves
It hid the braces on his legs at first
His smile was as bright as the August sun
When he looked at me
As he struggled down the driveway
It almost made me hurt
Will don't walk too good
Will don't talk too good
He won't do the things that the other kids do
In our neighborhood

[Chorus]
I've been searching, wondering, thinking
Lost and looking all my life
I've been wounded, jaded, loved, and hated
I've wrestled wrong and right
He was a boy without a father
And his mother's miracle
I've been reading, writing, praying, fighting
I guess I would be still
Yeah, that was until
I knew God's Will

[Verse 2]
Will's mom had to work two jobs
We'd watch him when she had to work late
And we'd all laugh like I hadn't laughed
Since I don't know when
""Hey Jude"" was his favorite song
At dinner he'd ask to pray
And then he'd pray for everybody in the world but him

[Chorus]
I've been searching, wondering, thinking
Lost and looking all my life
I've been wounded, jaded, loved, and hated
I've wrestled wrong and right
He was a boy without a father
And his mother's miracle
I've been reading, writing, praying, fighting
I guess I would be still
Yeah, that was until
I knew God's Will

[Verse 3]
Before they moved to California
His mother said, they didn't think he'd live
And she said each day that I have him
Well, it's just another gift
And I never got to tell her
That the boy showed me the truth
In crayon red, on notebook paper, he'd written
Me and God love you

[Outro]
I've been searching, praying, wounded, jaded
I guess I would be still
Yeah that was until
I met God's Will on a Halloween night
He was dressed as a bag of leaves"
Martina McBride,My Baby Loves Me,"[Verse 1]
Don't need no copy of Vogue magazine
Don't need to dress like no Beauty Queen
High heels or sneakers, he don't give a damn
My baby loves me just the way that I am
My baby loves me just the way that I am

[Verse 2]
He never tells me I'm not good enough
Just gives me unconditional love
He loves me tender, he loves me mad
He loves me silly and he loves me sad

[Chorus]
He thinks I'm pretty, he thinks I'm smart
He likes my nerve and he loves my heart
He's always saying he's my biggest fan
My baby loves me just the way that I am
My baby loves me just the way that I am

[Verse 3]
When there's dark clouds in my eyes
He just sits back and lets 'em roll on by
Come in like a lion and go out like a lamb
My baby loves me just the way that I am
My baby loves me just the way that I am

[Chorus]
He thinks I'm pretty, he thinks I'm smart
He likes my nerve and he loves my heart
He's always saying he's my biggest fan
My baby loves me just the way that I am

[Outro]
He thinks I'm pretty, he thinks I'm smart
He likes my nerve and he loves my heart
Don't see no reason to change my plan
My baby loves me just the way that I am
My baby loves me just the way that I am"
Martina McBride,Blessed,"[Verse 1]
I get kissed by the sun
Each morning
Put my feet on a hardwood floor
I get to hear my children laughing
Down the hall through the
Bedroom door
Sometimes I sit on my
Front porch swing
Just soaking up the day
I think to myself, I think to myself
This world is a beautiful place

[Chorus]
I have been blessed
And I feel like I've found my way
I thank God for all I've been given
At the end of every day
I have been blessed
With so much more than I deserve
To be here with the ones
That love me
To love them so much it hurts
I have been blessed

[Verse 2]
Across a crowded room
I know you know what I'm thinking
By the way I look at you
And when we're lying in the quiet
And no words have to be said
I think to myself, I think to myself
This love is a beautiful gift

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
When I'm singing my kids to sleep
When I feel you holding me
I know

[Chorus]"
Martina McBride,Wrong Again,"[Verse]
From the day we met
You made me forget
All my fears
Knew just what to say
And you kissed away
All my tears
I knew this time I had finally found
Someone to build my life around
Be a lover and a friend
After all my heart had put me through
I knew that it was safe with you
And what we had would never end
Wrong again
Everybody swore
They'd seen this before
We'd be fine
And you'd come to see that you still loved me
In good time
And they said there's nothing you can do
It's something that he's going through
It happens to a lot of men
And I told myself that they were right
That you'd wake up and see the light
And I just had to wait 'til then
Wrong again
And it seemed to me the pain would last
My chance for happiness had passed
And nothing waited 'round the bend
I was sure I'd never find someone
To heal the damage you had done
My poor heart would never mend
Wrong again
Wrong again"
Martina McBride,When God Fearing Women Get The Blues,"Lock up your husbands
Lock up your sons
Lock up your whiskey cabinets
Girls lock up your guns
And Lock up the beauty shop
No tellin if they've heard the news
Call the boys downtown and Neiman Marcus
Tell Em' lock them high heeled shoes

Chorus:
When God fearin' women get the blues
There ain't no slap down or tellin what they're gonna do
Run around yellin
I've got a mustang it'll do 80
You don't have to be my baby

You don't have to be my, be my, be my baby
Call all the decons
Call the ladies aid
Call all the altos, sopranos
Tenors call every bass
Well call all the pentacostals
And bring all the annointing oil too
Well call the preacher

You don't have to be my, be my, be my baby
She's on all our prayer lists
She's on all our hearts
As for the easter cantada picked out
We don't know who'll sing her part
When God fearin' women get the blues
There ain't no slap down or tellin what they're gonna do
Run around yellin
I've got a mustang it'll do 80
You don't have to be my baby
I stirred my last batch of gravy
You don't have to be my, be my, be my baby"
Martina McBride,O Holy Night,"[Verse 1]
Oh holy night!
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of the dear Savior's birth!
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Until He appeared and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn!

[Chorus]
Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine
Oh night when Christ was born
Oh night divine [x2]

[Repeat Verse 1]

[Chorus]
Oh night, Oh night divine [x2]"
Martina McBride,Wild Angels,"[Verse 1]
Between the perfect world and the bottom line
Keeping love alive in these troubled times
Well, it's a miracle in itself
And we know too well what that's about
Still we made it through, only God knows how
We must've had a little help

[Chorus]
It must've been wild angels, wild angels
Watching over you and me, yeah
Wild angels, wild angels
Baby, what else could it be?

[Verse 2]
Well, it must've been hard, it must've been tough
Keeping up with crazy fools like us
'Cause it's so easy to fall apart
We still break each other's hearts sometimes
Spend some nights on the jagged side
Somehow we wake up in each other's arms

[Chorus]
Oh, it must've been wild angels, wild angels
Watching over you and me, yeah
Wild angels, wild angels
Baby, what else could it be?

[Bridge]
There are some nights
I watch you while you dream
I swear I hear the sound of
Beating wings, yeah

Oh, it must've been wild angels, wild angels
Watching over you and me, yeah
Wild angels, wild, wild angels
Baby, what else could it be?

Wild angels (Wild angels)

Martina McBride,I Just Call You Mine,"[Verse 1]
I pinch myself
Sometimes to make sure I'm not in a dream
That's how it seems
I close my eyes
And breathe in the sweetest moments I've ever known
It feels like home

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And here I am
I want to be your everything
There you are
Turning winter into spring

[Chorus]
And everyone that sees you
Always wants to know you
And everyone that knows you
Always has a smile
You're a standing ovation
After years of waiting
For a chance to finally shine
Everyone calls you amazing, yeah
I just call you mine

[Verse 2]
I fall apart
And just a word from you somehow seems to fix
Whatever's wrong, oh
You reach into the weakest moments
And remind me that I'm strong
You got to know

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'd be a fool
Not to see, or even worse, to forget
That you're more than I deserve

[Chorus]
'Cause everyone that sees you
Always wants to know you
And everyone that knows you
Always has a smile
You're a standing ovation
After years of waiting
For a chance to finally shine
Everyone calls you amazing
I just call you mine

[Bridge]
Nothing makes sense when you're not here
As if my whole world disappears
Without you what's the point of it

[Chorus 2]
'Cause everyone that sees you
Always wants to know you
And everyone that knows you
Always has a smile
You're the dream that I've been chasing
After years of waiting
For a chance to finally shine
Everyone calls you amazing
I just call you mine

Everyone calls you amazing, yeah
I just call you
Mine"
Martina McBride,Whatever You Say,"[Verse 1]
You think I'm always making
Something out of nothing
You're saying everything's okay
You've always got an answer
Before I ask the question
Whatever you say
Now we can change the subject
Pretend I never brought it up
Same old story anyway
Later we can work it out
Right now you're talked out
Yeah, whatever you say

[Chorus]
Oh I know you can hear me
But I'm not sure you're listening
I hear what you're saying
But still there's something missing
Whether I go whether I stay
Right now depends on
Whatever you say

[Verse 2]
You say yes you need me
And no you wouldn't leave me
And this should be enough to make me stay
And even though I want to
I don't hear I love you
In whatever you say

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Oh whether I go whether I stay
Right now depends on
Whatever you say[3x]"
Martina McBride,Happy Girl,"[Verse 1]
I used to live in a darkened room
Had a face of stone and a heart of gloom
Lost my hope, I was so far gone
Crying all my tears with the curtains drawn
I didn't know until my soul broke free
I've got these angels watching over me

[Chorus]
Oh, watch me go
I'm a happy girl, everybody knows
That the sweetest thing that you'll ever see
In the whole wide world is a happy girl

[Verse 2]
I used to hide in a party crowd
Bottled up inside, feeling so left out
Standing in a corner wearing concrete shoes
With my frozen smile and my lighted fuse
Now every time I start to feel like that
I roll my heart out like a welcome mat

[Chorus]
Oh, watch me go
I'm a happy girl, everybody knows
That the sweetest thing that you'll ever see
In the whole wide world is a happy girl

[Bridge]
Laugh when I feel like it
Cry when I feel like it
That's just how my life is
That's how it goes

[Chorus]
Oh, watch me go
I'm a happy girl, and I've come to know
That the world won't change just 'cause I complain
Let the axis twirl, I'm a happy girl
Oh, watch me go
I'm a happy girl, everybody knows
That the sweetest thing that you'll ever see
In the whole wide world is a happy girl

[Outro]
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah, I'm a happy girl"
Martina McBride,Chances Are,"[Verse 1: Bob Seger]
Chances are you'll find me
Somewhere on your road tonight
Seems I always end up drivin' by
Ever since I've known you
It just seems you're on my way
All the rules of logic don't apply
I long to see you in the night
Be with you 'til morning light

[Verse 2: Martina McBride]
I remember clearly
How you looked the night we met
I recall your laughter and your smile
I remember how you made me
Feel so at ease
I remember all your grace, your style
And now you're all I long to see
You've come to mean so much to me

[Verse 3: Bob Seger & Martina McBride, Bob Seger]
Chances are I'll see you
In my dreams tonight
You'll be smilin' like the night we met
Chances are I'll hold you
And I'll offer all I have
You're the only one I can't forget
Baby you're the best I've ever met

And I'll be dreaming of the future
And hopin' you'll be by my side
And in the morning I'll be longing
For the night
For the night

[Verse 4: Bob Seger & Martina McBride]
And chances are I'll see you
In my dreams tonight
You'll be smilin' like the night we met (Oh)
Chances are I'll hold you
And I'll offer all I have
You're the only one I can't forget
Baby you're the best I've ever met
Ooh, ooh"
Martina McBride,Where Would You Be,"[Verse 1]
I wonder where your heart is 'cause it sure don't feel like it's here
Sometimes I think you wish that I would just disappear
Have I got it all wrong?
Have you felt this way long?
Are you already gone?

[Verse 2]
Do you feel lonely when you're here by my side?
Does the sound of freedom echo in your mind?
Do you wish you were by yourself
Or that I was someone else
Anyone else?

[Chorus]
Where would you be if you weren't here with me?
Where would you go if you were single and free?
Who would you love? Would it be me?
Where would you be?

[Verse 3]
I don't wanna hold you back, no, I don't wanna slow you down
I don't wanna make you feel like you are tied up and bound
'Cause that's not what love's about
If there's no chance we can work it out
Tell me now
Oh, tell me, tell me now

[Chorus]
Where would you be if you weren't here with me?
Where would you go if you were single and free?
Who would you love? Would it be me?
Where would you be?

[Bridge]
Have I become the enemy?
Is it hard to be yourself in my company?

[Chorus]
Where would you be if you weren't here with me?
Where would you go if you were single and free?
Who would you love? Would it be me?
Where would you be?

[Outro]
Oh tell me, tell me now
Where would you be?
Where would you go?
Who would you love?
Would it be me?"
Martina McBride,When Love Is Gone (Pop Version),"[Verse 1]
There was a time when I was sure
That you and I were truly one
That our future was forever
And would never come undone
And we came so close to being close
And though you cared for me
There's distance in your eyes tonight
So we're not meant to be

[Chorus]
The love is gone
The love is gone
The sweetest dream
That we have ever known
The love is gone
The love is gone
I wish you well
But I must leave you now alone

[Verse 2]
There comes a moment in your life
Like a window and you see
Your future there before you
And how perfect life can be
But adventure calls with unknown voices
Pulling you away
Be careful or you may regret
The choice you make someday

[Chorus]
When love is gone
When love is gone
The sweetest dream
That we have ever known
When love is gone
When love is gone
I wish you well
But I must leave you now alone

[Verse 3]
It was almost love
It was almost always
It was like a fairytale we'd live out
You and I
And yes some dreams come true
And yes some dreams fall through
And yes the time has come for us to say goodbye
Yes some dreams come true
Yes some dreams fall through
And yes the time has come for us to say goodbye"
Martina McBride,’Til I Can Make It On My Own,"[Verse 1]
I'll need time
To get you off my mind
And I may sometimes bother you
Try to be in touch with you
Even ask too much of you
From time to time

[Refrain]
Now and then
Lord ya know I'll need a friend
'Til I get used to losing you
Let me keep on using you
'Til I can make it on my own

[Verse 2]
I'll get by
But no matter how I try
There'll be times you know I'll call
Chances are my tears will fall
And I'll have no pride at all
From time to time

[Refrain]
But they say
Oh, there'll be a brighter day
But 'til then I'll lean on you
That's all I mean to do
'Til I can make it on my own

[Bridge]
Surely someday I'll wake up and see the morning sun
Without another lonely night behind me
Then I'll know I'm over you and all my crying's done
No more hurting memories can find me

[Refrain]
But 'til then
Lord, ya know I'm gonna need a friend
'Til I get used to losing you
Let me keep on using you
'Til I can make it on my own"
Martina McBride,Love’s The Only House,"[Verse 1]
I was standing in the grocery store line
The one they marked express
When this woman came through with about 25 things
And I said don't you know that more is less
She said this world is moving so fast
I just get more behind every day
And every morning when I make my coffee
I can't believe my life's turned out this way
All I could say was

[Chorus]
Love's the only house
Big enough for all the pain in the world
Love's the only house
Big enough for all the pain

[Verse 2]
He was walking by the other day and I said
Hey baby, how you've been
Yeah I got me a little girl now and she's 4 years old
And she's got her daddy's little grin
And you only wanted what you can't have
And baby you can't have me now
I gave my heart to another
Yeah I'm a mother and he's a father and we're a family and we got each other
And I found out the hard way that

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You drive three miles from all this prosperity
Down across the river and you see a ghetto there
And we got children walking around with guns
And they got knives and drugs and pain to spare
And here I am in my clean white shirt
With a little money in my pocket and a nice warm home
And we got teenagers walking around in a culture of darkness
Living together alone, all I can say is

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
And I can't explain it and I can't understand
But I'll come down and get my hands dirty
And together we'll make a stand

[Verse 4]
Somewhere 'cross the parking lot some band's playing out of tune
City streets are going burn if we don't do something soon
And señorita can't quit crying
Baby's due now any day
Don Juan left got sick of trying
No one there to show him the way
She came down to the grocery store
And she said I want to buy a little carton of milk
But I don't have any money
I said hey I'll cover you honey
Because the pain's got to go somewhere
Yeah the pain's got to go someplace
So come on down to my house
Don't you know that

[Chorus][x2]"
Martina McBride,Girls Like Me,"[Verse 1]
I remember that first time I fell in love
I've never been the one to be afraid to jump
And sometimes it hurts
But the world still turns
I remember that first sad broken heart
And I told myself I wouldn't fall apart
So I let it burn
That's how you live and learn

[Pre-Chorus]
It ain't always easy
But it's gonna be alright

[Chorus]
It used to be me hidin' insecurities
With a cigarette and a bottle of whiskey
I was a girl at home in the dark, all alone
Sayin', ""Why the hell doesn't he miss me?""
We act so tough like it ain't nothin'
'Cause we don't want them to see
Here's to the girls like me

[Verse 2]
Fast forward, now your old dreams are gone
And you got new priorities
You thought you knew what you wanted
But you had it all wrong
Yeah, it takes a few steps
Just to get it all together
It might hurt now but it won't last forever
Make those mistakes, it'll make you better

[Chorus]
Yeah, it used to be me hidin' insecurities
With a cigarette and a bottle of whiskey
Yeah, I was a girl at home in the dark, all alone
Sayin', ""Why the hell doesn't he miss me?""
We act so tough like it ain't nothin'
'Cause we don't want them to see
Here's to the girls like me

[Post-Chorus]
Here's to the girls like me
Here's to the girls like me
Here's to the girls like me

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, it takes a few steps just to get it all together
Make those mistakes that'll make you better

[Chorus]
It used to be me hidin' insecurities
With a cigarette and a bottle of whiskey
I was a girl at home in the dark, all alone
Sayin', ""Why doesn't he miss me?""
I wouldn't trade what made ya
The woman you're gonna be
And it's okay if it's not perfect
'Cause it's not meant to be
Here's to the girls like me

[Post-Chorus]
Here's to the girls like me
Here's to the girls like me
Here's to the girls like me
Girl, you're just like me"
Martina McBride,You’ll Get Through This,"Pull the shades down on the sun
Don't want to see the morning break to another day
I don't have the strength to face
Close the door and keep it shut
Lord this ache is just too much for me to take
How do I begin to pray
My way back to some kind of peace of mind
But then I hear love whispering through the darkest of times

You'll get through this
You'll break new ground
When you're lost within your weakness
Hope is waiting to be found
You'll get through this
No matter what it takes
I believe in you for heaven's sake
You'll get through this

When doubt starts tearing it
The faith deep in you don't be afraid
Just remember what I say
Nothing formed against you will succeed
As long as your hearts turn to me

You'll get through this
You'll break new ground
When you're lost within your weakness
Hope is waiting to be found
You'll get through this
No matter what it takes
I believe in you for heaven's sake
You'll get through this

Nothing formed against ya will succeed
As long as your hearts turn to me

You'll get through this
You'll break new ground
When you're lost within your weakness
Hope is waiting to be found
You'll get through this
No matter what it takes
I believe in you for heaven's sake
You'll get through this"
Freddy Fender,Before the Next Teardrop Falls,"[Verse 1]
If he brings you happiness
Then I wish you all the best
It's your happiness that matters most of all
But if he ever breaks your heart
If the teardrops ever start
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls

[Verse 2]
Si te quiere de verdad
Y te da felicidad
Te deseo lo mas bueno pa'los dos
Pero si te hace llorar
A mi me puedes hablar
Y estare contigo cuando triste estas

I'll be there anytime
You need me by your side
To dry away every teardrop that you cried
And if he ever leaves you blue
Just remember, I love you
And I'll be there before the next teardrop falls

And I'll be there before the next teardrop falls"
Freddy Fender,Wasted Days and Wasted Nights,"[Verse 1]
Wasted days and wasted nights
I have left for you behind
For you don't belong to me
Your heart belongs to someone else

[Pre-Chorus]
Why should I keep loving you?
When I know that you're not true
And why should I call your name
When you're the blame for making me blue

[Chorus]
Don't you remember the day
That you went away and left me
I was so lonely, prayed for you only
My love

Why should I keep loving you?

And why should I call your name
When you're the blame for making me blue

When you're the blame for making me blue"
Freddy Fender,Vaya Con Dios,"Now the hacienda's dark, the town is sleeping;
Now the time has come to part, the time for weeping
Vaya con Dios my darling
May God be with you my love

Wherever you may be, I'll be beside you
Although you're many million dreams away
Each night I'll say a pray'r, a pray'r to guide you
To hasten ev'ry lonely hour of ev'ry lonely day

Now the dawn is breaking through a gray tomorrow
But the memories we share are there to borrow
Vaya con Dios, my darling:
May God be with you my love

Now the village mission bells are softly ringing
If you listen with your heart you'll hear them singing
Vaya con Dios my darling
May God be with you my love

Wherever you may be I'll be beside you
Although you're many million dreams away
Each night I'll say a pray'r, a pray'r to guide you
To hasten ev'ry lonely hour of ev'ry lonely day

Now the dawn is breaking through a gray tomorrow
But the memories we share are there to borrow
Vaya con Dios, my darling!
Vaya con Dios, my love"
Freddy Fender,Secret Love,"Once I had a secret love
That lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love
Became impatient to be free

So I told a friendly star
The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are
And why I'm so in love with you

Now I shout it from the highest hills
Even told the golden daffodils
At last my heart's an open door
And my secret love is no secret anymore

Now I shout it from the highest hills
Even told the golden daffodils
At last my heart's an open door
And my secret love is no secret anymore"
Freddy Fender,The Wild Side of Life,"You wouldn't read my letters if I wrote them
You ask me not to call you on the phone
But there's something I've been waiting for to tell you
So I wrote it in the words of this song

I didn't know God made honky tonk angels
I might have known you'd never make a wife
You gave up the only one that ever loved you
And went on back to the wild side of life

The glamor of the gay nightlife has lured you
To the places where the wine and liquor flow
Where you wait to be somebody else's baby
And forget the truest love you'll ever know

I didn't know God made honky tonk angels
I might have known you'd never make a wife
You gave up the only one that ever loved you
And went on back to the wild side of life, oh yeah

Well, the glamor of the gay nightlife has lured you
To the places where the wine and liquor flow
Where you wait to be somebody else's baby
And forget the truest love you'll ever know

I didn't know God made honky tonk angels
I might have known you'd never make a wife
You gave up the only one that ever loved you
And went on back to the wild side of life, oh yeah

I didn't know God made honky tonk angels
I might have known you'd never make a wife
You gave up the only one that ever loved you
And went on back to the wild side of life"
Freddy Fender,Since I Met You Baby,"Since I met you baby my whole life has changed
Since I met you baby my whole life has changed

Cause since I met you baby all I need is you

Since I met you baby I'm a happy man
Since I met you baby I'm a happy man
I'm gonna try to please you in every way I can"

Allá en el rancho grande

Freddy Fender,I’m Not a Fool Anymore,"I'm not a fool anymore
I'm not as dumb as before
All that has changed since it rained
Right from the sky from my eyes

So wipe those tears don't cry
It's over now all your life
All that has changed since it rained
Right from the sky from my eyes

You let me hug you, let me kiss you
And I kept on thinking that our love would always be
But my eyes don't lie to me
Cheating, lying
It's all comes back somehow

I'm not a fool anymore
I'm not a clown as before
All that has changed since it rained
Right from the sky from my eyes

You let me hug you, let me kiss you…

I'm not ashamed anymore
I'm not a clown as before
All that has changed since it rained
Right from the sky from my eyes"
Freddy Fender,Roses Are Red,"A long, long time ago
On graduation day
You handed me your book
I signed this way

Roses are red, my love
Violets are blue
Sugar is sweet, my love
But not as sweet as you

We dated through high school
And when the big day came
I wrote into your book
Next to my name

Roses are red, my love
Violets are blue
Sugar is sweet, my love
But not as sweet as you

Then I went far away

And you found someone new
I read your letter dear
And I wrote back to you

Roses are red, my love
Violets are blue
Sugar is sweet, my love
Good luck God bless you too

Is that your little girl
She looks a lot like you
Someday some boy will write
In her book, too

Roses are red, my love
Violets are blue
Sugar is sweet, my love
But not as sweet as you"
Freddy Fender,Just a Moment of Your Time by Freddy Fender,"Just a moment of your time
Would you be so kind
As to give to me
Just a moment of time
I'm not asking for an hour
Just time enough to share
That my love for you
Grows stronger day by day
Just a moment with you
Will make all dreams come true
Please let me share
Just a moment of your time
Interlude
One moment with you
Would make all my dreams come true
Please let me share
Just a moment with you

Freddy Fender,Then You Can Tell Me Goodbye,"Kiss me each morning for a million years
Hold me each evening by your side
Tell me you love me for a million years

Then if it don't work out, then if it don't work out
Then you can tell me goodbye

Sweeten my coffee with a morning kiss
Soften my dreams with your sigh
Tell me you love me for a million years

Then if it don't work out, then if it don't work out
Then you can tell me goodbye

If it don't work out, if it don't work out
Then you can tell me goodbye

If you must go I won't grieve
If you wait a lifetime before you leave
But if you must go, I won't tell you no
Just so that we can say that we try
Tell me you love me for a million years

Then if it don't work out, then if it don't work out
Then you can tell me goodbye"
Freddy Fender,I Can’t Stop Loving You,"I can't stop loving you
I made up my mind
To live in a memory
Of a lonesome time

I can't stop wanting you
It's useless to say
So I just live my life
In dreams of yesterday

Those happy, happy hours
That we once knew
So long ago
Still make me blue

They say that time
Time heals a broken heart
But time's stood still
Since we've been apart

I can't stop loving you
I made up my mind
To live in a memory
Of a lonesome time

I can't stop wanting you
It's useless to say
So I just live my life
In dreams of yesterday"

Here's a song we had I wrote with, uh, for the first Tornado album time we got it goin'

Freddy Fender,You Can’t Get Here From There,"I knew when the phone rang it was you again
You're out there somewhere crying
And you need a friend
I hear a jukebox playing in a honky tonk somewhere
You're wanting to come home again
But you can't here from there

Have you forgotten so soon what the trouble was
Must I keep reminding you what came between us
You want a home and family
But you want your nighttime flair
You're wanting to come home again
But you can't here from there

I know you really mean it, you'd come home again
It would be the same old story
You'd still need your friends
You're miss their haunting laughter
And the flashing neon's glare
You're wanting to come home again
But you can't here from there

Have you forgotten so soon what the trouble was
Must I keep reminding you what came between us
You want a home and family
But you want your nighttime flair
You're wanting to come home again
But you can't here from there"

Now they say that absence makes
The heart grow fonder (fonder)
And that tears are only rain to make love grow

If I lived to be a hundred years old

Oh, it's cryin' time again, you're gonna leave me
I can see that far away look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you hold me darlin'. Yeah now

That it won't be long before it's cryin' time

That you love better (better)

After the fire is gone

The bottle is almost empty
The clock's just now struck ten
Darling I had to call you
To our favorite place again

We know it's wrong for us to meet
But the fire's gone out at home
And there's nothing cold as ashes
After the fire is gone

Love is where you find it
When you find no love at home
And there's nothing cold as ashes
After the fire is gone

(instrumental)

Your lips are warm and tender
Your arms hold me just right
Sweet words of love you remember
That the one at home forgot

Each time we say it's the last time
But we keep hanging on
And there's nothing cold as ashes
After the fire is gone

Love is where you find it
When you find no love at home
And there's nothing cold as ashes
After the fire is gone

And there's nothing cold as ashes
After the fire is gone"
Freddy Fender,I Almost Called Your Name,"[Verse 1]
We were dancing, and she laughed just like you used to
She touched my hand and held me just like you used to
And so close to my lips the words came
That I almost, I almost called your name

[Verse 2]
Yes, I almost called, I almost called your name
In so many ways you are both the same
The only difference in the two is that I still love you
Yes, I kissed her but I almost called your name

Se parese a ti en muchas cosas y me besa como tú
Me besas a mi, pero, amor, como tú
Ya no se olvida
La besé y me acordé de ti"
Freddy Fender,Release Me,"Please release me, let me go
For I don't love you anymore

And I will always want her near
Her lips are warm while yours are cold
Release me my darling, let me go

Please release me, let me go
For I don't love you anymore
To waste my life would be a sin

To live a life to bring us pain
So release me and let me love again

Let me love
Let me go"

Freddy Fender,Please Don’t Tell Me How the Story Ends,"This could be our last good night together
We may never pass this way again
Just let me enjoy it till it's over or forever
Please don't tell me how the story ends

See the way our shadows come together
Softer than your fingers on my skin
Someday these may be all we remember of each other
Please don't tell me how the story ends

Never's just the echo of forever
Lonesome as the love that might have been
Let me go on loving and believing till it's over
Please don't tell me how the story ends
Please don't tell me how the story ends"
Freddy Fender,I’m leaving it up to you,"I'm leavin' it all up to you-ooh-ooh
You decide what you're gonna do
Now do you want my lo-o-ove?
Or are we through?
That's why I'm leaving it up to you-ooh-ooh
You decide what you're gonna do
Now do you want my lo-o-ove?
Or are we through?
I've got my heart in my hand
I-I don't understand
Baby, what, what have I done wrong?
You know, I worship the ground that you walk on
That's why I'm leavin' it up to you-ooh-ooh
You decide what you're gonna do
Now do you want my lo-o-ove?
Or are we through?"
Freddy Fender,Mathilda,"Your love for me will always be
A special thing for me
You know I cried and cried for you
In the battle of the do

Mathilda, I cried and cried for you
It don't matter what I do
Yes, I cried and cried in vain
I want my baby back again

You gave me love right at the start
You know you're the only one
The fear that's in my heart's the same
I want my baby back again

Mathilda, I cried and cried for you
It don't matter what you do
Yes, I cried and cried in vain
I want my baby back again

Mathilda, I cried and cried for you
It don't matter what you do
Yes, I cried and cried in vain
I want my baby back again

You gave me love right at the start
You know you're the only one
The fear that's in my heart's the same"
Don Williams,I Believe In You,"[Verse 1]
I don't believe in superstars
Organic food and foreign cars
I don't believe the price of gold
The certainty of growing old
That right is right and left is wrong
That north and south can't get along
That east is east and west is west
And being first is always best

[Chorus]
But I believe in love
I believe in babies
I believe in mom and dad
And I believe in you

[Verse 2]
Well I don't believe that heaven waits
For only those who congregate
I like to think of God as love
He's down below, he's up above
He's watchin' people, everywhere
He knows who does and doesn't care
And I'm an ordinary man
Sometimes I wonder who I am

[Chorus]
But I believe in love
I believe in music
I believe in magic
And I believe in you

[Bridge]
I know with all my certainty
What's going on with you and me
Is a good thing
It's true
I believe in you

[Verse 3]
I don't believe virginity
Is as common as it used to be
In working days and sleeping nights
That black is black and white is white
That Superman and Robin Hood
Are still alive in Hollywood
That gasoline's in short supply
The rising cost of gettin' by

[Chorus]
But I believe in love
I believe in old folks
I believe in children
I believe in you
I believe in love
I believe in babies
I believe in mom and dad
And I believe in you"
Don Williams,Some Broken Hearts Never Mend,"Coffee black, cigarettes
Start this day, like all the rest
First thing every morning that I do
Is start missing you

Some broken hearts never mend
Some memories never end
Some tears will never dry
My love for you will never die

Rendezvous in the night
A willing woman to hold me tight
But in the middle of love's embrace
I see your face

Some broken hearts never mend
Some memories never end
Some tears will never dry
My love for you will never die"
Don Williams,You’re My Best Friend,"[Verse 1]
You placed gold on my finger
You brought love like I've never known
You gave life to our children
And to me a reason to go on

[Chorus]
You're my bread when I'm hungry
You're my shelter from troubled winds
You're my anchor in life's ocean
But most of all you're my best friend

[Verse 2]
When I need hope and inspiration
You're always strong when I'm tired and weak
I could search this whole world over
You'd still be everything that I need

[Chorus]
You're my bread when I'm hungry
You're my shelter from troubled winds
You're my anchor in life's ocean
But most of all you're my best friend

[Outro]
You're my bread when I'm hungry
You're my shelter from troubled winds
You're my anchor in life's ocean
But most of all you're my best friend"
Don Williams,Lord I Hope This Day Is Good,"Lord, I hope this day is good
I'm feelin' empty and misunderstood
I should be thankful, Lord, I know I should
But Lord I hope this day is good

Lord, have you forgotten me
I've been prayin' to you faithfully
I'm not sayin' I'm a righteous man
But Lord I hope you understand

I don't need fortune and I don't need fame
Send down the thunder, Lord, send down the rain
But when you're plannin' just how it will be
Plan a good day for me

Lord, I hope this day is good
I'm feelin' empty and misunderstood
I should be thankful, Lord, I know I should
But Lord I hope this day is good

You've been the King since the dawn of time
All that I'm askin' is a little less crime
It might be hard for the devil to do
But it would be easy for you

Lord, I hope this day is good
I'm feelin' empty and misunderstood
I should be thankful, Lord, I know I should
But Lord I hope this day is good"
Don Williams,Amanda,"[Verse 1]
I've held it all inward, Lord knows I've tried
It's an awful awakenin' in a country boy's life
To look in the mirror in total surprise
At the hair on your shoulders and the age in your eyes

[Chorus]
Amanda, light of my life
Fate should've made you a gentleman's wife
Amanda, light of my life
Fate should've made you a gentleman's wife

[Verse 2]
Well, a measure of people don't understand
The pleasures of life in a hillbilly band
I got my first guitar when I was fourteen
Now I'm crowding thirty and still wearing jeans

[Chorus]
Amanda, light of my life
Fate should've made you a gentleman's wife
Amanda, light of my life
Fate should've made you a gentleman's wife
Amanda, light of my life
Fate should've made you a gentleman's wife
Amanda, light of my life
Fate should've made you a gentleman's wife"
Don Williams,Good Ole Boys Like Me,"[Verse 1]
When I was a kid Uncle Remus he put me to bed
With a picture of Stonewall Jackson above my head
Then daddy came in to kiss his little man
With gin on his breath and a Bible in his hand
He talked about honor and things I should know
Then he staggered a little as he went out the door

[Chorus]
I can still hear the soft southern winds in the live oak trees
And those Williams boys, they still mean a lot to me
Hank and Tennessee
I guess we're all gonna be what we're gonna be
So, what do you do with good ole boys like me?

[Verse 2]
Nothing makes a sound in the night like the wind does
But you ain't afraid if you're washed in the blood like I was
The smell of Cape Jasmine through the window screen
John R. and the Wolfman kept me company
By the light of the radio by my bed
With Thomas Wolfe whispering in my head

[Chorus]
I can still hear the soft southern winds in the live oak trees
And those Williams boys, they still mean a lot to me
Hank and Tennessee
I guess we're all gonna be what we're gonna be
So, what do you do with good ole boys like me?

[Verse 3]
When I was in school I ran with a kid down the street
And I watched him burn himself up on Bourbon and speed
But I was smarter than most and I could choose
Learned to talk like the man on the six o'clock news
When I was eighteen Lord I hit the road
But it really doesn't matter how far I go

[Chorus]
I can still hear the soft southern winds in the live oak trees
And those Williams boys, they still mean a lot to me
Hank and Tennessee
I guess we're all gonna be what we're gonna be
So, what do you do with good ole boys like me?
Yeah, what do you do with good ole boys like me?"
Don Williams,Tulsa Time,"[Verse 1]
I left Oklahoma, drivin' in a Pontiac
Just about to lose my mind
I was goin' to Arizona, maybe on to California
Where the people all live so fine

[Verse 2]
My baby said, I's crazy, my mama called me lazy
I was gonna show 'em all this time
'Cause you know I ain't no fool and I don't need no more schoolin'
I was born to just walk the line

[Chorus]
Livin' on Tulsa time, livin' on Tulsa time
Well, you'll know I been through it
When I set my watch back to it
Livin' on Tulsa Time

[Verse 3]
Well, there I was in Hollywood, wishin' I was doin' good
Talkin' on the telephone line
But they don't need me in the movies and nobody sings my songs
Guess, I'm just a wastin' time

[Verse 4]
Well, then I got to thinkin', man I'm really sinkin'
An' I really had a flash this time
I had no business leavin' an' nobody would be grievin'
If I went on back to Tulsa time

[Chorus]
Livin' on Tulsa time, livin' on Tulsa time
Gonna set my watch back to it
'Cause you know I been through it
Livin' on Tulsa time

[Chorus]
Livin' on Tulsa time, livin' on Tulsa time
Gonna set my watch back to it
'Cause you know I been through it
Livin' on Tulsa time"
Don Williams,It Must Be Love,"First I get cold then hot
Think I'm on fire
But I'm not
Oh, what a pain I've got
It must be love

There's nothin' I can do
All that I want is you
Look what I'm goin' through
It must be love

It must be love
It must be love
I fall like a sparrow
Fly like a dove
You must be the dream
I've been dreamin' of
Oh, what a feelin'
It must be love

Somethin' is wrong, alright
I think of you all night
Can't sleep till mornin' light
It must be love

Seein' you in my dreams
Feelin' you close to me
Oh, what eles can it be?
It must be love

It must be love
It must be love
I fall like a sparrow
Fly like a dove
You must be the dream
I've been dreamin' of
Oh, what a feelin'
It must be love

It must be love
It must be love
I fall like a sparrow
Fly like a dove
You must be the dream
I've been dreamin' of
Oh, what a feelin'
It must be love

It must be love
It must be love
I fall like a sparrow
Fly like a dove
You must be the dream
I've been dreamin' of
Oh, what a feelin'
It must be love..."
Don Williams,Senorita,"(Spoken)
Back in the innocent days
There was a young Cowboy
Who was in love with a Mexican girl
Only she didn't know it

And he would watch her when she walked back
In the cotton dress which danced in the wind
And her eyes held the stars
Now, she was the most beautiful thing that cowboy had ever seen

Sent down straight from heaven
But he was afraid he would never win her heart
Cause of some family scars left by the rain forest
But oww... how he loved her

Senorita passing by
Pardon me if I stop and ask you why
Senorita, could it be?
Someone like you could love someone like me?

--- Instrumental ---

(Spoken)
So he walked up to her
Tipped his hat and introduced himself
And she looked up at him and didn't know what to say
So he told her the story of his family
The trouble that brought the barbed wire

And all the things that he couldn't change
And then he told her that he loved her
And he studied her reaction
And by the time the spring rains came
They were married

Now, there's an ol' song
That my family used to sing
'Bout a young cowboy and a mexican girl
And how they fell in love

Senorita passing by
Pardon me if I stop and ask you why
Senorita, could it be?
Someone like you could love someone like me

Senoritra passing by
Pardon me if I stop and ask you why
Senorita, could it be?
Someone like you could love someone like
Someone like you could love someone like me"
Don Williams,I Recall A Gypsy Woman,"Silver coins that jingle jangle
Fancy shoes that dance in time
Oh, the secrets of her dark eyes
They did sing a gypsy rhyme
Yellow clover in tangled blossoms
In a meadow silky green
Where she held me to her bosom
Just a boy of seventeen

I recall a gypsy woman
Silver spangles in her eyes
Ivory skin against the moonlight
And the taste of life's sweet wine

Soft breezes blow from fragrant meadows
And stir the darkness in my mind
Oh, gentle woman you sleep beside me
Little know who haunts my mind
Gypsy lady, I hear your laughter
And it dances in my head
While my tender wife and babies
Slumber softly in their beds

I recall a gypsy woman
Silver spangles in her eyes
Ivory skin against the moonlight
And the taste of life's sweet wine..."
Don Williams,Listen To The Radio,"I guess as a lover I have a ways to go
When someone wants you they should just say it's so
But you'll understand if you'll take my hand
And then we can dance real slow
To something on the radio

Listen to the radio
Oh, listen to the radio
'Let's spend the night together
Baby don't go'
They sing it on the radio

I try to find a way to explain to you
What's on my mind and not sound so plain to you
But you'll realize if you close your eyes
The feelings my words can't show
They're playing on the radio

(Repeat chorus)
The words I'd say
Don't seem to sound as real
The songs they play
That's how I really feel, so

(Repeat chorus)"
Don Williams,We Got Love,"[Verse 1]
You, you got me
We got somethin' everybody else can see
Me, I got you
We got a good thing, honey, you know we do
Friends, they all know
'Cause we can't help but let it show
Smiles, we can't hide
We got somethin' just too good to hold inside

[Chorus]
We don't need no money, honey, you and I
What we've got together, money just can't buy
What we've got, there's plenty of
I got you, you got me, we got love

Time, moves along
And honey we just keep on a keepin' on
'Cause love, makes us strong
As long as we got love, we can't go wrong

What we've got together, money just can't buy
What we've got, there's plenty of
I got you, you got me, we got love"
Don Williams,Desperately,"My heart is out of control
This ol' love struck so
Just lives for the moment you're around
When I hold on to you
It is all I can do
Just to keep my feet on the ground

Desperately
Loving you desperately
When you are not here with me
I get a little bit crazy

Constantly
Think about you constantly
Look at what you done to me
I'm just like a little baby
Oh, I love you desperately

--- Instrumental ---

Will I laugh?
Will I cry?
Will I live?
Will I die?
It all depends upon you

And it is dangerous
I know
To be lost in you so
But I'm that
There's nothing I can do

Desperately
Loving you desperately
When you are not here with me
I get a little bit crazy

Constantly
Think about you constantly
Look at what you done to me
I'm just like a little baby
Oh, I love you desperately

Desperately
Loving you desperately
When you are not here with me
I get a little bit crazy

Constantly
Think about you constantly
Look at what you done to me
I'm just like a little baby
Oh, I love you desperately"
Don Williams,I’m Just A Country Boy,"[Verse 1]
I ain't gonna marry in the fall
Ain't gonna marry in the spring
'Cause I'm in love with a pretty little girl
Who wears a diamond ring

[Chorus]
And I'm just a country boy
Money have I none
But I've got silver in the stars
And gold in the mornin' sun
Gold in the mornin' sun

[Verse 2]
Never gonna kiss the ruby red lips
Of the prettiest girl in town
Never gonna ask her if she'd marry me
I know she'd turn me down

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm just a country boy
Money have I none
But I've got silver in the stars
And gold in the mornin' sun
Gold in the mornin' sun

[Verse 3]
I never could afford a store bought ring
With a sparkling diamond stone
All I could afford is a lovin' heart
The only one I own

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm just a country boy
Money have I none
But I've got silver in the stars
And gold in the mornin' sun
Gold in the mornin' sun"
Don Williams,Lay Down Beside Me,"[Verse 1]
I've spent my life looking for you
Finding my way wasn't easy to do
But I knew there was you all the while
And it's been worth every mile

[Chorus]
So lay down beside me
Love me and hide me
Kiss all the hurtin' of this world away
Hold me so close that I feel your heartbeat
And don't ever wander away

[Verse 2]
Mornings and evenings all were the same
And there was no music till I heard your name
But I knew when I saw you smile
Now I can rest for awhile

[Chorus]
So lay down beside me
Love me and hide me
Kiss all the hurtin' of this world away
Hold me so close that I feel your heartbeat
And don't ever wander away"
Don Williams,Till The Rivers All Run Dry,"Till the rivers all run dry
Till the sun falls from the sky
Till life on earth is through
I'll be needing you

I know sometimes you may wonder
From little things I say and do
But there's no need for you to wonder
If I need you, 'cause I'll need you

Till the rivers all run dry
Till the sun falls from the sky
Till life on earth is through
I'll be needing you

Too many times I don't tell you
Too many things get in the way
And even though sometimes I hurt you
Still you show me, in every way

Till the rivers all run dry
Till the sun falls from the sky
Till life on earth is through
I'll be needing you"
Don Williams,If Hollywood Don’t Need You,"Well you know I'm not much good at writin' letters
So I gave up and decided that I'd call
Naw' there's really not much new to tell ya
Things back here they never change at all
It snowed today, it's cold here for November
But I hear the weather's warm out there

Oh, and if you see Burt Reynolds
Would you shake his hand for me
And tell ol' Burt , I've seen all his movies
Well, I hope you make the big time
I hope your dreams come true
But if Hollywood don't need you
Honey I still do

Last night I drove the truck to Amarillo
Some friends and I we had a laugh or two
But lately we don't cut up like we used to
'Cause all that I can think about is you
Well, I know this is what you've always wanted
But I know now that all I want is you

So if you see Burt Reynolds
Would you shake his hand for me
And tell ol' Burt , I've seen all his movies
Well, I hope you make the big time
I hope your dreams come true
But if Hollywood don't need you
Honey I still do
If Hollywood don't need you
Honey, I still do"

Well, you get down the fiddle and you get down the bow
Kick off your shoes and you throw 'em on the floor

Don Williams,I’ve Been Loved By the Best,"Darling, if you ever leave me
Well, I'll just put my heart away
I couldn't love again, believe me
No one could please me anyway
And if another ever came along
I'd just turn them down 'cause after all

I've been loved by the best
I can't settle now for less
Why bother with the rest
Baby, I've been to the top, I guess
With you I have been blessed
I won't take nothin' less
I've been loved by the best

If you ever get tired of me
Well, I won't look for someone new
'Cause looking back on how you loved me
No one could measure up to you
And if they try to win this heart of mine
I just have to say, a waste if time

I've been loved by the best
I can't settle now for less
Why bother with the rest
Baby, I've been to the top, I guess
With you I have been blessed
I won't take nothin' less
I've been loved by the best

When I look into your eyes I know
You're the only love I ever want
'Cause, after you and me
Baby, I can see
Nothin' else could be even close

I've been loved by the best
I can't settle now for less
Why bother with the rest
Baby, I've been to the top I guess
With you I have been blessed
I won't take nothin less
I've been loved by the best..."
Don Williams,Sing Me Back Home,"The warden led a prisoner down the hallway to his doom
I stood up to say good-bye like all the rest
And I heard him tell the warden just before he reached my cell
'Let my guitar playing friend do my request.' (Let him...)
Sing me back home with a song I used to hear
Make my old memories come alive
Take me away and turn back the years
Sing Me Back Home before I die
I recall last Sunday morning a choir from 'cross the street
Came to sing a few old gospel songs
And I heard him tell the singers 'There's a song my mama sang
Can I hear once before we move along?'

Sing me back home, the song my mama sang
Make my old memories come alive
Take me away and turn back the years
Sing Me Back Home before I die

Sing Me Back Home before I die"
Don Williams,We Should Be Together,"I think about you
When I don't want to
Dream about your smiling face
I keep trying not to love you
But I love you anyway

We should be together, together
We should be walking side by side
We should be together, together
Keeping each other satisfied

I have thought to come to know you
I've come to need your company
What will I do if I can't have you
If I can't have you
What will I do

We should be together, together
We should be walking side by side
We should be together, together
Keeping each other satisfied

We should be together, together
We should be walking side by side
We should be together, together
Keeping each other satisfied..."
Don Williams,True Love,"Adam and Eve on a Saturday night
That's when the trouble started
She said Adam let's go for a bite
She led him through the garden

And ever since then we tried to make sense
Of this mystery emotion
But we might as well try to count the stars in the sky
Or those raindrops in the ocean

Chorus:
Well, you know it's true love
Deeper than deep
Hotter than a fire
Well, it's hard to find and it's harder to keep
It's the thing we most desire

I was alone for so many nights
I really started to wonder
If I had run outa chances to find
A spell I could fall under
Then you walked in like in a Elvis film
You were singing Love Me Tender
I was a hypnotized by your blue eyes
And the next thing I remember

Chorus:
Well you know it's true love
Deeper than deep
Hotter than a fire
Well, it's hard to find and it's harder to keep
It's the thing we most desire

And there is true love in a winkin' eye
And the sweet perfume that lingers
And it's a I love you on a new tattoo
And that diamond on her finger

Chorus:
Well, you know it's true love
Deeper than deep
Hotter than a fire
Well, it's hard to find and it's harder to keep
It's the thing we most desire

It's the true love we most desire..."
Don Williams,Come Early Morning,"I been a walkin', walkin' in the moonlight
Trippin' in the starlight, Lord, and I'm feelin' down
Walkin' in the shadows, sneakin' down a side road
Come early mornin' I'll be there on the edge of town

I was a thinkin', thinkin' bout a good thing
Thinkin' bout a sweet gleam, uum, in my honey's eyes
And I was a-sinkin', feelin' kinda lonesome
Come early morning I'll be home at my honey's side

I have drifted up across the mountain
And I have stumbled down the other side
And I've been tempted, tried and troubled
Come early morning I'll be home and satisfied

[Instrumental]

She give me little lovin'
Give me little sunshine
Make me have a good time, Lord
When I'm feelin' blue
I couldn't refuse her
Well I couldn't misuse her
Come early mornin' I'll be home
With my honeydew

I have drifted up across the mountains
I have stumbled down the other side
I've been tempted, tried and troubled
Come early mornin' I'll be home
And satisfied..."

One magic moment, was all it took
From that moment, I loved you so
Now that I found you I'm never gonna let you go

Barbara Mandrell,Born To Die,"[Verse 1]
Shepherds gaze in wonder
While angel voices sing
This night of nights has come
And brought the world the long-awaited King
The earth is filled with gladness
And yet the heavens weep
For heaven's eyes can see
He was born to die for me

[Chorus]
Jesus
Baby Jesus
Is that a tear in your eye?
Jesus
Baby Jesus
You must know you were born to die

[Verse 2]
It must have broken God's heart
For the future He could see
Yet He formed the hands and feet
Knowing one day they'd be nailed to a tree
So all the world could know Him
A gift came from above
For God so loved the world (He loved the world)
That He gave His only Son (Gave his only)

[Chorus]
Jesus
Baby Jesus
With a tear of love in your eye
Jesus
Sweet baby Jesus
You knew you were born to die

[Outro]
So Jesus
Thank you, Jesus
For your gift of eternal life
My Jesus
Jesus
'Cause for me, you were born to die"
Barbara Mandrell,"No Walls, No Ceilings, No Floors","[Verse 1]
Let me love you, come close to me
Locked in my arms, you'll still be free
Don't be frightened my high-flying bluebird
'Cause my love has no walls
No walls, no ceilings
No walls, no ceilings, no floors

[Verse 2]
All my love songs are just for you
Sing them with me, and when you do
Don't be frightened my high-flying bluebird
'Cause my love has no walls (No walls)

Barbara Mandrell,Angel in Your Arms,"[Verse 1]
Do you think I'm such a fool
To believe everything you say is true?
That just goes to show
That you really don't know
While you're out paintin' the town
Do you think I'm home just sittin' around
Waitin' on you?
Now who's really the fool?

[Pre-Chorus]
When I first found out, I hurt all over
I felt so left out 'til I got to know her
So I tried to wait, but she got over
And I became just like her
So don't be surprised to find

[Chorus]
That the angel in your arms this mornin'
Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight
Yes, the angel in your arms this mornin'
He's gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight

[Verse 2]
Why'd you slip around secretly
If you were tired of lovin' me?
Why'd you keep holdin' on
When love was already gone?
The times you said you weren't feelin' well
Did you think that I couldn't tell
You'd been with someone else?
Well, you were only kidding yourself

[Pre-Chorus]
When I first found out, I hurt all over
I felt so left out 'til I got to know her
So I tried to wait, but she got over
And I became just like her
So don't be surprised to find

[Chorus]
That the angel in your arms this mornin'
Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight
Yes, the angel in your arms this mornin'
Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight
The angel in your arms this mornin'
He's gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight
Yes, the angel in your arms this mornin'
He's gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight"
Barbara Mandrell,I Was Country When Country Wasn’t Cool,"I remember wearing straight leg Levis, flannel shirts
Even when they weren't in style
I remember singing with Roy Rogers at the movies
When the West was really wild
And I was listening to the Opry
When all of my friends were digging rock n' roll and rhythm and blues
I was country when country wasn't cool

I remember circling the drive-in
Pulling up and turning down George Jones
I remember when no one was looking
I was putting peanuts in my Coke
I took a lot of kidding, 'cause I never did fit in
Now look at everybody trying to be what I was then
I was country when country wasn't cool

I was country when country wasn't cool
I was country from my hat down to my boots
I still act and look the same
What you see ain't nothing new
I was country when country wasn't cool

They call us country bumpkins for sticking to our roots
I'm just glad we're in a country when we're all free to choose
I was country when country wasn't cool

Hey, I was country when country wasn't cool
Yeah, I was country from my hat down to, whoa, my boots
I still act and look the same
What you see ain't nothing new
I was country when country wasn't cool
Yeah, I was country when country wasn't cool"
Barbara Mandrell,It Must Have Been the Mistletoe (Our First Christmas),"[Verse 1]
It must have been the mistletoe
The lazy fire, the falling snow
The magic in the frosty air, that feeling everywhere
It must have been the pretty lights
That glistened in the silent night
It may be just the stars so bright that shined above you

[Chorus]
Our first Christmas more than we'd been dreaming of
Old St. Nicholas had his fingers crossed
That we would fall in love

[Verse 2]
It could have been the holiday, the midnight ride upon a sleigh
The countryside all dressed in white, that crazy snowball fight
It could have been the steeple bell that wrapped us up within its spell
It only took one kiss to know it must have been the mistletoe

[Chorus]
Our first Christmas more than we'd been dreaming of
Old St. Nicholas must have known that kiss
Would lead to all of this

[Verse 3]
It must have been the mistletoe
The lazy fire, the falling snow
The magic in the frosty air that made me love you
On Christmas Eve our wish came true, the night I fell in love with you
It only took one kiss to know it must have been the mistletoe

[Outro]
It must have been the mistletoe (Mistletoe)
The lazy fire, the falling snow (Falling snow)
The magic in the frosty air, that feeling everywhere
It must have been the mistletoe (Mistletoe)
The lazy fire, the falling snow (Falling snow)
The magic in the frosty air that made me love you
It must have been the mistletoe (Mistletoe)
The lazy fire, the falling snow (Falling snow)
The magic in the frosty air, that feeling everywhere"
Barbara Mandrell,(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don’t Want To Be Right,"If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
If being right means being without you
I'd rather live a wrong than right

My mama and daddy say it's a shame
It's a downright disgrace
But as long as I got you by my side
I don't care what my people say

My friends tell me there's no future
In loving a married man
If I can't see you when I want
I'll see you when I can

If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right

Am I wrong to fall
So deeply in love with you
Knowing you got a wife
And two little children
Depending on you too

Am I wrong to hunger
For the gentleness of your touch
Knowing you got somebody else at home
Who needs you just as much

Am I wrong to give my love
To a married man
Am I wrong for trying to hold on
To the best thing I ever had

If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right

Am I wrong to give my love
To a married man
Am I wrong for trying to hold on
To the best thing I ever had

If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right

I don't wanna be right
If it means sleeping without you
I don't wanna be right
If it means sleeping alone at night
I don't wanna be right

If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
If loving you is wrong
No, I don't wanna be right"
Barbara Mandrell,Married But Not To Each Other,"[Intro]
You know, sometimes in your life
You may find it hurts to be in love
Especially when you and the one you love
Already belong to somebody else
You're tied to her and I'm tied to him
And we don't wanna hurt either one of them
That's how it is

[Verse 1]
When you're married
But not to each other
You gotta go home in the middle of the night
Try and pretend everything's alright
But it ain't, no, it ain't
When you're married (When you're married)
But not to each other (To each other)
Make believe that you've been good
Give your love to the one you should
But you can't, no, you can't

[Chorus]
'Cause you're tied to her, I'm tied to him
We don't wanna hurt either one of them
So what can you do? What can you do?

[Verse 2]
When you're married
But not to each other
You gotta be careful everywhere you go
You're tryin' to avoid everyone you know
'Cause people talk, you know they talk
When you're married (When you're married)
But not to each other (To each other)
You gotta make up alibis
Hopin' they don't sound like lies
'Cause if you get caught and you might get caught

[Bridge]
Hurry up and love him, hurry up and please him
And when it gets right, you've got to leave him
You better leave him

[Chorus]
'Cause you're tied to her, I'm tied to him
We don't wanna hurt either one of them
That's how it is, that's how it is

[Outro]
When you're married
But not to each other
Hurry up and love him, hurry up and please him
And when it gets right, you've got to leave him
You better leave him

Thinking over things I wish I'd said
I should've held you, but I let you go
Now I'm the one sleeping all alone.  Oh
Sleeping single in a double bed (Oooh, oooh, oooh.)
Tossing, turning, trying to forget.  (Ah, ah, ah.)
I could be lying with you instead
I'm sleeping single in a double bed

I'd pour me a drink, but I'd only be sorry
'Cause drinking doubles alone don't make it a party
Another sleepless night and it's the same old story
When you're the only one at two in the morning

I'm sleeping single in a double bed (Oooh, oooh, oooh.)
Thinking over things I wish I'd said.  (Ah, ah, ah.)

Barbara Mandrell,Crackers,"Hello baby, I'm sorry I said
The things I did, it was a silly fight
I was wrong you were right
What I really mean to say is

You can eat crackers in my bed anytime, baby
You can kick off all the covers in the middle of the night
You can sleep with the window open wide
Do anything as long as your by my side
You can eat crackers in my bed anytime

I should be happy, no dishes to wash now
But my own, no clothes to pick up
A double bed to myself now that your gone
Oh but it's lonely, I'm sorry I ever let you go
It's a matter of fact I've got to have you back
I just want you to know

You can eat crackers in my bed anytime, baby
You can kick off all the covers in the middle of the night
You can sleep with the window open wide
Do anything as long as your by my side
You can eat crackers in my bed anytime

You can sleep with the window open wide
Do anything as long as your by my side
You can eat crackers in my bed anytime

Whoa, you can eat crackers in my bed anytime, baby

Barbara Mandrell,I’ll Leave Something Good Behind,"[Verse 1]
Oh, this world we're in today
Sometimes ain't a pretty place
But when I look at you, I see something beautiful
And in my heart I know there's a reason
You put your tiny hand in mine
And I look in your trusting eyes
Knowing that love will see us through
But if my life should end tomorrow
I know you'll be the living proof

[Chorus]
And I'll leave something good behind
You sweet child of mine
You make my life worth living
And when all my earthly days are through
I'll leave here knowing I did what I came to do
And when I say goodbye
I know that I'll leave something good behind

[Verse 2]
Well, at times it's been a fight
But I've tried to do what's right
Even when everything went wrong
I still believed that we would make it
It hasn't always turned out like I planned
But I've done the best I can
To help you someday face the world alone
And after I've been long forgotten
You'll be my legacy of love

[Chorus]
And I'll leave something good behind
You sweet child of mine
You make my life worth living
And when all my earthly days are through
I'll leave here knowing I did what I came to do
And when I say goodbye
I know that I'll leave something good behind

[Outro]
Yes, when I say goodbye
I know that I'll leave something good behind"
Barbara Mandrell,I Wish That I Could Fall in Love Today,"I wish that I could fall in love today
But memories of you stand in the way
And I just can't make my heart find someone new
'Cause it's always much to busy lovin' you

Each night I pray I'll wake at dawn and find
Another in my heart and on my mind
Then I awake I hear my poor heart say
I wish that I could fall in love today
I wish that I could fall in love today
But if I did I know I wouldn't stay
'Cause you'd come between us like you always do
Somehow they never measure up to you

Oh I wish that I could fall in love today"
Barbara Mandrell,Standing Room Only,"[Verse 1]
You must think my bed's a bus stop
The way you come and go
I ain't seen you with the lights on
Two nights in a row
So pack your rusty razor
Don't bother with goodbye
Your cup runneth over
But mine is always dry

[Chorus]
Standin' room only
I can't stand no more
Standin' room only
Outside my door

[Verse 2]
Don't help me set the table
'Cause now there's one less place
I won't lay Mama's silver
For a man who won't say grace
If home is where the heart is
Then your home's on the streets
Me, I'll read a good book
Turn out the lights and go to sleep

[Chorus]
Standin' room only
I can't stand no more, no more
Standin' room only
Outside my door
Standin' room only
I can't stand no more, no more
Standin' room only
Outside my door"
Barbara Mandrell,Midnight Angel,"[Verse 1]
There's a place in every bar room
And a verse in every song
For a woman trapped and lonely
By a man who's done her wrong
I thought that neon nightmares
Were like Sunday sermon scares
'Til I turned to face the man I loved
And found a pillow there

[Chorus]
Is there room for another midnight angel?
Are there words for another hurtin' song?
Is there room for another midnight angel?
If there is, I'm bettin'
I'll have my wings before the mornin' comes

[Verse 2]
It's a long, long way from heaven
To those dreamy neon lights
But I'm needin' more than memories
To fill my empty nights
Now, I know it won't be easy
'Cause I'm not the easy kind
But I need someone to hold me
Or I'm gonna lose my mind

[Chorus]
Is there room for another midnight angel?
Are there words for another hurtin' song?
Is there room for another midnight angel?
If there is, I'm bettin'
I'll have my wings before the mornin' comes

[Outro]
Is there room for another midnight angel?
Are there words for another hurtin' song?
Is there room for another midnight angel?"
Barbara Mandrell,The Midnight Oil,"That call was from the office and I guess I'll have to burn the midnight oil again
And hon' you know how much the boss depends on me to lend a helping hand
I watch him in the mirror as I lie and tell him I don't know how late I'll be
While I'm puttin' on my makeup I'm puttin' on the one that really loves me
The girls all got together and they called to see if I could have some fun tonight
But you know me the only thing I do is go to work and watch TV
And I watch him in the mirror as I lie and tell him I don't know how late I'll be
While I'm puttin' on my makeup I'm puttin' on the one that really loves me
And tonight I'll cheat again and tomorrow I'll be sorry
And I'll feel kind of dirty cause I'll have the midnight oil all over me
God knows his dream would shatter if he knew the devil had me and won't set me free
While I'm puttin' on my makeup I'm puttin' on the one that really loves me
While I'm puttin' on my makeup I'm puttin' on the one that really loves me"
Barbara Mandrell,Years,"[Verse 1]
Faded photographs
The feelings all come back
Even now sometimes
You feel so near
And I still see your face
Like it was yesterday
It's strange how the days turned into years

[Chorus]
Years of hanging on (Hanging on)
To dreams are already gone
Years of wishing you were here
After all this time (All this time)
You'd think I wouldn't cry
It's just that I still love you after all these years

[Verse 2]
Nighttime gently falls
Another day is gone
I turn around to find you're still not here
I leave the hall light on
In case you come back home
But I've been saying that for years

[Chorus]
Years of hanging on (Hanging on)
To dreams are already gone
Years of wishing you were here
After all this time (All this time)
You'd think I wouldn't cry
It's just that I still love you after all these years

After all these years"
Barbara Mandrell,Woman to Woman,"[Intro]
Hello?
You don't know who this is, but
The reason I'm calling you is because
I was going through my man's pockets this morning
And I just happened to find your name and number
So, woman to woman, I don't think it's wrong to call you
Now, I don't know how you're gonna take this
You might even hang up the phone

That that man that you've been seeing
He's mine, and I love him
So woman to woman, I think you'll understand

Woman to woman

Barbara Mandrell,Happy Birthday Dear Heartache,"It's just a year today
One year since he went away
So happy birthday, dear heartache
You're one year old today

There'll be the cake tonight
One candle I'm gonna light
So happy birthday, dear heartache
Old love still burns tonight

When he walked out, I felt my heart break
That's when you came to me, dear heartache
You made my heart your home
Now look how big you've grown

Looks like each guest is here
The blues, the memories, and the tears
So happy birthday, dear heartache
Same time, same place next year
So happy birthday, dear heartache
Same time, same place next year"
Barbara Mandrell,This Time I Almost Made It,"[Verse 1]
This time I almost made it, came so close to saying no
I almost found the words to make you go
This time I almost made it, almost pushed you away
But my heart cried out, begging you to stay

[Verse 2]
And now I'm laying here beside you cryin' softly
'Cause I know you're going home to her
'Cause you belong to her
And you go home to her

I know you steal away, I know there'll be another day
That you'll come back again
And you'll say, ""Hello, friend""
And I'll reach out my hand

Barbara Mandrell,In Times Like These,"Sitting on the front porch
Rain is pouring down
News comes on the radio
There's trouble all around

That's the way it always been
And the way it'll always be
I thank the good Lord I've got you
In times like these

The rich keep getting richer
The poor barely get by
Farmer Johnson says it's either
Too wet or too dry

Jobs are scarce down at the factory
I thank the good Lord I've got you
In times like these

In times like these
When it's easy to get down
You're my inspiration
You're my solid ground

In times like these
Love will pull us through
Baby, I know I can depend on you

We can read about the latest
In the fashion magazines
But that don't change the fact
That we got patches on our jeans

Everybody's needing money
Even the preachers preaching on TV
I thank the good Lord I've got you
In times like these

In times like these
When it's easy to get down
You're my inspiration
You're my solid ground

In times like these
Love will pull us through
Baby, I know I can depend on you

It costs you forty-five cents
For a nickel candy bar
And a dollar's worth of gas
Won't even start your car

Yeah, we got problems
Here in the land of free
But there's no place I'd rather be

In times like these
I thank the good Lord I've got you

Barbara Mandrell,Give a Little Take a Little,"You've got to give a little take a little if you want to get a little lovin'
And do all the things that make your man feel right
And if you give a little take a little then you're gonna get a lotta lovin'
And you're never gonna ever have to spend another lonely night

If he needs a little lovin' then hold him
Cause if you don't the fires of love are gonna get a little cold and dim
And if his day don't go your way then take it with a little smile
After all it's the ups and downs of love that makes it all worthwhile
You've got to give a little...

Never mind the times when his feet feel the need for freedom
Just as long as they bring him on home to you when you need him
To show you care you gotta be there when he laughs or when he cries
There's no mistaking givin' and talking is the very best part of life
You've got to give a little...
You've got to give a little..."
Barbara Mandrell,Wish You Were Here,"I took a vacation down by the ocean
But it's no fun with a heart that's broken
Ooh, baby, I wish you were here

I see lovers walking on the beach at sunset
I turned to you, I guess I'm just in the habit
Ooh, baby, I wish you were here

I wish you were here, I've gotta be honest
It's no fun alone drinking pina coladas
I wish you were here but you're with another
It's gonna be a long, lonely summer

If I knew where you were
I'd send you a postcard
Having a blue time, I'm so lonely so far
Ooh, baby, I wish you were here

I wish you were here, I've gotta be honest
It's no fun alone drinking pina coladas
I wish you were here but you're with another
It's gonna be a long, lonely summer

Pull back the covers, I'm going to bed now
Ooh, baby, I wish you were here
Ooh, baby, I wish you were here
Ooh, baby, I sure wish you were here"
Barbara Mandrell,From Our House To Yours,"A Christmas tree with lights turned low
Kids out of school, praying for snow
It's the season for counting blessings, as the old year ends
The crowded streets, the friendly smiles
At Christmas, everyone's a child
It's that precious time for family and friends

From our house to yours, we send our love
Straight from the heart, 'cause you mean so much
From our house to yours, may everyone be blessed
May this Christmas be the best, from our house to yours

Old memories and mistletoe
Cards signed with love, hang in a row
That feeling of Christmas fills the air
The manger scene, the star above
Reminds us all, God sends His love
May His spirit follow you throughout the year

From our house to yours, we send our love
Straight from the heart, 'cause you mean so much
From our house to yours, may everyone be blessed
And may this Christmas be the best from our house to yours
And may this Christmas be the best from our house to yours

Barbara Mandrell,Tonight,"Tonight's my lucky night I know
He talked to me
To tell me he's been thinking of me
And all this time he's changed his mind
Oh, he told me so
That's how I know he's gonna love me

Tonight's the night
We'll turn out the light
And love again
Like we did back then
And we'll start all over
Tonight

Tonight's my lucky night I'm sure
He's at my door
I've waited for this chance to hold him
And how I see he's needed me
Oh, imagine that
He's coming back
Coming back to live forever

Tonight's the night

And love again
Like we did back then
And we'll start all over

It's so hard to explain
Everything that I'm feelin'
Face to face I just seem to go dry
But I love you so much
That the sound of your voice can get me high

Thanks for takin' me
On a one way trip to the sun
And thanks for turnin' me
Into someone

So you sing me to sleep
After the lovin'
I brush back the hair from your eyes
And the love on your face
Is so real that it makes me want to cry

And I know that your song
Isn't sayin' anything new
Oh, but after the lovin'
I'm still in love with you

So you sing me to sleep
After the lovin'
I brush back the hair from your eyes
And the love on your face
Is so real that it makes me want to cry

And I know that your song
Isn't sayin' anything new
Oh, but after the lovin'
I'm still in love with you

Yes, after the lovin'
I'm still in love with you

Hmmm, after the lovin'
I'm still in love with you"
Eddy Arnold,Make the World Go Away,"[Chorus]
Make the world go away
And get it off my shoulders
Say the things you used to say
And make the world go away

[Verse 1]
Do you remember when you loved me
Before the world took me astray?
If you do then forgive me
And make the world go away

[Chorus]
Make the world go away
And get it off my shoulders
Say the things you used to say
And make the world go away

[Verse 2]
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'll make it up day by day
Just say you love me like you used to
And make the world go away

[Chorus]
Make the world go away
And get it off my shoulders
Say the things you used to say
And make the world go away

[Outro]
Say the things you used to say
And make the world go away"
Eddy Arnold,It’s a Sin,"[Verse 1]
It's a sin, my darlin', how I love you
Because I know our love can never be
It's a sin to keep this memory of you
When silence proves that you've forgotten me
The dream I built for us has tumbled
Each promise broken like my heart
It's a sin, my darlin', how I love you
So much in love and yet so far apart

[Verse 2]
It's a sin to hide behind this heartache
To make believe that I've found someone new
It's a sin to say that I don't miss you
When people know I'm still in love with you
I'm sure you're happy with another
Who shares the love I couldn't win
Why pretend that I can't live without you
When deep inside I know that it's a sin?"
Eddy Arnold,Cattle Call,"[Verse]
The cattle are prowlin', the coyotes are howlin'
Way out where the doggies bawl
Where spurs are a-jinglin', a cowboy is singin'
This lonesome cattle call

[Chorus]
He rides in the sun 'til his day's work is done
As he rounds up the cattle each fall
Singin' his cattle call

[Chorus]
He's brown as a bearie from ridin' the prairie
And he sings with an old western drawl
Singin' his cattle call"
Eddy Arnold,Anytime,"[Verse 1]
Anytime you're feeling lonely
Anytime you're feeling blue
Anytime you feel down hearted
That will prove your love for me is true

[Chorus]
Anytime you're thinking 'bout me
That's the time I'll think of you
Anytime you say you want me back again
That's the time I'll come back home to you

[Verse 2]
Anytime your world is lonely
And you'll find true friends a few
Anytime you see a rainbow
That will be a sign the storm is through

[Verse 3]
Anytime will be the right time
Anytime at all will do
Anytime you're sure you want only my love
That's the time I'll come back home to you

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Anytime you're thinking 'bout me
That's the time I'll think of you
Anytime you say you want me back again
That's the time I'll come back home to you"
Eddy Arnold,I Am Thine O Lord,"I am Thine oh Lord, I have heard Thy voice
And it told Thy love to me
But I long to rise in the arms of faith
And be closer drawn to Thee

Draw me nearer, nearer blessed Lord
To the cross where Thou has died
Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer blessed Lord
To Thine precious bleeding side

Consecrate me now to Thy service Lord
By the power of grace divine
Let my soul look up with a steadfast hope
And my will be lost in Thine

Draw me nearer, nearer blessed Lord
To the cross where Thou has died
Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer blessed Lord
To Thine precious bleeding side

--- Instrumental ---

There are depths of love that I cannot know
Till I cross the narrow sea
There are heights of joy that I may not reach
Till I rest in peace with Thee

Draw me nearer, nearer blessed Lord
To the cross where Thou has died
Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer blessed Lord
To Thine precious bleeding side..."
Eddy Arnold,I’ll Hold You In My Heart (Till I Can Hold You In My Arms),"[Verse]
I'll hold you in my heart till I can hold you in my arms
Like you'd never been held before
I'll think of you each day, and then I'll dream the night away
Till you are in my arms once more

The stars up in the sky know the reason why
I feel so blue when I'm away from you
I'll hold you in my heart till I can hold you in my arms
So darlin', please wait for me

The stars up in the sky know the reason why
I feel so blue when I'm away from you

Eddy Arnold,You Don’t Know Me,"[Verse 1]
You give your hand to me, and then you say hello
And I can hardly speak my heart is beating so
And anyone could tell you think you know me well
But you don't know me

[Verse 2]
No, you don't know the one who dreams of you at night
And longs to kiss your lips and longs to hold you tight
To you I'm just a friend that's all I've ever been
No, you don't know me

[Bridge]
For I never knew the art of making love
Though my heart ached with the love for you
Afraid and shy I let my chance go by
The chance you might have loved me, too

[Verse 3]
You gave your hand to me, and then you say goodbye
I watch you walk away beside the lucky guy
To never, never know the one who loves you so
No, you don't know me

[Verse 3]
You gave your hand to me, and then you say goodbye
I watch you walk away beside the lucky guy
To never, never know the one who loves you so
No, you don't know me"
Eddy Arnold,M-O-T-H-E-R (A Word That Means The World To Me),"I've been around the world, you bet, but never went to school Hard knocks are all I seem to get, perhaps I've been a fool; But still, some educated folks, supposed to be so swell, Would fail if they were called upon a simple word to spell. Now if you'd like to put me to the test, There's one dear name that I can spell the best! ""M"" is for the million things she gave me ""O"" means only that she's growing old ""T"" is for the tears she shed to save me ""H"" is for her heart of purest gold ""E"" is for her eyes with love-light shining ""R"" means right and right she'll always be Put them all together they spell MOTHER, a word that means the world to me. When I was but a baby, long before I learned to walk, While lying in my cradle, I would try my best to talk; It wasn't long before I spoke and all the neighbors heard, My folks were very proud of me for ""Mother"" was the word. Although I'll never lay a claim to fame, I'm satisfied that I can spell the name: ""M"" is for the mercy she possesses ""O"" means that I owe her all I own ""T"" is for her tender, sweet caresses ""H"" is for her hands that made a home ""E"" means ev'rything she's done to help me ""R"" means real and regular, you see Put them all together they spell MOTHER, a word that means the world to me"
Eddy Arnold,Tell Me The Story Of Jesus,"(Tell me the story of Jesus)
(Sweetest that ever was heard.)

Tell me the story of Jesus
Write on my heart every word
Tell me the story most precious
Sweetest that ever was heard

Tell how the angels in chorus sang
As they welcomed his birth
Glory to Thy in the highest
Peace and the tidings to earth

Tell me the story of Jesus
Sweetest that ever was heard

Tell of the cross where they nailed him
Right in the anguish and pain
Tell of the grave where they laid him
Tell how he lived it again

(Tell me the story so tender)
(Clearer than ever I see)
(Still let me weep while you whisper)
(Love great and grandsome for me.)

Tell me the story of Jesus
Sweetest that ever was heard..."
Eddy Arnold,Bouquet of Roses,"I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses
One for every time you broke my heart
And as the door of love between us closes
Tears will fall like petals when we part

I begged you to be different
But you'll always be untrue
I'm tired of forgivin'
Now there's nothin' left to do

So I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses
One for every time you broke my heart

You made our lovers' lane a road of sorrow
Till at last we have to say goodbye
You're leaving me to face each new tomorrow
With a broken heart you taught to cry

I know that I should hate you
After all you've put me through
But how can I be bitter
When I'm still in love with you?

So I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses
One for every time you broke my heart"
Eddy Arnold,Cowpoke,"[Verse 1]
I'm lonesome but happy
Rich but I'm broke
And the good Lord knows the reason
I'm just a cowpoke

[Verse 2]
From Cheyenne to Douglas
All the ranges I know
'Cause I drift with the wind
No one cares where I go

[Verse 3]
I ain't got a dime
In these old wore-out jeans
So I'll stop eatin' steak
And go back to beans

[Verse 4]
I'll pick up a ten spot
In Prescott, I know
A-ridin' the broncs
In the big rodeo

[Verse 5]
Some evenin' in springtime
A filly I'll find
And we might spend all the summer
With her on my mind

[Verse 6]
But I'll never be branded
And never be broke
I'm a carefree range-ridin'
Driftin' cowpoke"
Eddy Arnold,The Kentuckian Song,"I see my darling in each spray of summer sunlight
I see my darling in the leaves that fall
I see her walking in the rainy April sadness
And hear her name in every bluebird call

I told the possum in the gumtree the rackoon on the ground
Told everyone bout my darling of the happiness I found
My heart would cry more than the weeping willow tree
If my darling and her heart were not for me

I told the possum in the gumtree the rackoon on the ground
Told everyone bout my darling of the happiness I found
My heart would cry more than the weeping willow tree
If my darling and her heart were not for me..."
Eddy Arnold,C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S,"When I was but a youngster Christmas meant one thing
That I'd be getting lots of toys that day
I learned a whole lot different when mother set me down
And taught me to spell Christmas this way

C is for the Christ Child born upon this day
H is for Herald Angels in the night
R means our redeemer I means Israel
S is for the star that shone so bright
T is for three wise men they who travelled far
M is for the manger where he lay
A's for all he stands for S means shepherds came
And that's why there's a Christmas Day
And that's why there's a Christmas Day"
Eddy Arnold,I Thank My Lucky Stars,"I thank my lucky stars for every day I spent with you
I thank my lucky stars because I found a girl so true
Many times I've seen of the girls I might have had
Watched them while they fall in love and watched it turn out bad
So when I count my blessings honey youre my number one
And when I count my heartaches thanks to you they're number none
So if I see I'm little bit too much in love that's true
I thank my lucky stars because I found a girl like you
(I thank my lucky stars for every day I spent with you
I thank my lucky stars because I found a girl so true)
Many times I've seen..."
Eddy Arnold,Carry Me Back to the Lone Prairie,"[Chorus]
Oh, carry me back to the lone prairie
Where the coyotes howl and the wind blows free
And when I die you can bury me
'Neath the western skies on the lone prairie

[Verse]
I'm a roving cowboy far away from home
Far from the prairie where I used to roam
Where the dogies wander and the wind blows free
Though my heart is yonder on the lone prairie

[Chorus]
Oh, carry me back to the lone prairie
Where the coyotes howl and the wind blows free
And when I die you can bury me
'Neath the western skies on the lone prairie"
Eddy Arnold,A Cowboy’s Dream,"[Verse 1]
Last night as I laid on the prairie
And looked at the stars in the sky
I wondered if ever a cowboy
Would drift to that sweet by and by

[Chorus]
Roll along, roll along
Roll on little dogies roll on, roll on
Roll along, roll along
Roll on little dogies  roll on, roll on

[Verse 2]
The road to that bright happy region
Is a dim narrow trail so they say
But the bad one that leads to perdition
Is posted and blazed all the way

[Verse 3]
They say there will be a great roundup
And cowboys like dogies will stand
To be marched by the riders of judgement
Who are posted and know every brand

[Chorus]
Roll along, roll along
Roll on little dogies roll on, roll on
Roll along, roll along
Roll on little dogies roll on, roll on

[Verse 4]
They say he will never forget you
That he knows every action and look
So for safety you'd better get branded
Have your name in the great tally book

[Chorus]
Roll along, roll along
Roll on little dogies roll on, roll on
Roll along, roll along
Roll on little dogies roll on, roll on"
Eddy Arnold,Ole Faithful,"[Chorus]
Old faithful, we rode the range together
Old faithful in every kind of weather
When your roundup days are over
There'll be pastures white with clover
For you, old faithful pal of mine

[Bridge]
Hurry up old fellow, 'cause the moon is yellow tonight
Hurry up old fellow, 'cause the moon is mellow and bright
There's a coyote howlin' to the moon above
So carry me back to the one I love
Hurry up old fellow, 'cause we gotta get home tonight

[Chorus]
Old faithful, we rode the range together
Old faithful in every kind of weather
When your roundup days are over
There'll be pastures white with clover
For you, old faithful pal of mine
For you, old faithful pal of mine"
Eddy Arnold,Mommy Please Stay Home With Me,"A mother went out on a party
She left at home her baby son
He cried and begged her not to leave him
But she would not give up her fun

She kissed his cheek and tried to soothe him
But would not heed his childish plea
She heard him call as she was leavin'
""Please mommy, please stay home with me.""

The mother joined the merrymakers
And soon was lost in trifling joy
The mellow tunes and flitting shadows
Made her forget her baby boy

She danced and laughed and did some drinkin'
The world for her was full of glee
But now and then these words would haunt her
""Please mommy, please stay home with me.""

She left the party feeling dizzy
The smell of drinking on her breath
She hurried home to find her baby
In raging pain and nearing death

The doctor came and looked on sadly
The case was hopeless, he could see
The baby died, these words repeating
""Please mommy, please stay home with me.""

The mother now, her life would forfeit
To hear her baby's voice again
She grieved to think she rudely left him
To satisfy her wicked vain

Now mothers don't neglect your duty
This story should a lesson be
Do not ignore your baby's pleading
""Please mommy, please stay home with me."""
Eddy Arnold,That’s How Much I Love You,"Now, if I had a nickel, I know what I would do
I'd spend it all for candy and give it all to you
I'd spend it all for candy and give it all to you
'Cause that's how much I love you, baby
That's how much I love you

Now, if you were a kitten with pretty glossy fur
I'd take you up and stroke you and listen to you purr
I'd take you up and stroke you and listen to you purr
'Cause that's how much I love you, baby
That's how much I love you

Now, if you were a tiger, I'd hang around your den
I'd pester you, my honey, until you let me in
I'd pester you, my honey, until you let me in
'Cause that's how much I love you, baby
That's how much I love you

Now, if you were a horsefly, and I an old grey mare
I'd stand and let you bite me, and never move a hair
I'd stand and let you bite me, and never move a hair
'Cause that's how much I love you, baby
That's how much I love you

Now, if you want to marry, now, let me tell you what
I'll go and find the parson and let him tie the knot
We'll go and find the parson and let him tie the knot
'Cause that's how much I love you, baby
That's how much I love you"
Eddy Arnold,Rescue The Perishing,"Rescue the perishing, care for the dying
Snatch them in pity from sin and the grave
Weep o'er the erring, one lift up the fallen
Tell them of Jesus the mighty to save

Rescue the perishing, care for the dying
Jesus is merciful Jesus will save

Though they are slighting him still he is waiting
Waiting the penitent child to receive
Plead with them earnestly, plead with them gently
He will forgive if they only believe

Rescue the perishing, care for the dying
Jesus is merciful, Jesus will save

Strength for thy labor the Lord will provide
Back to the narrow way patiently win them
Tell the poor wanderer a Saviour has died

Rescue the perishing, care for the dying
Jesus is merciful Jesus will save..."
Eddy Arnold,Who at My Door is Standing,"Who at my door is standing
Patiently drawing near
Entrance within demanding?
Who is the voice I hear?

Sweetly the tones are fallin'
Open the door for Me
If thou wilt heed My callin'
I will abide with thee

Lonely without He's standing
Lonely within am I
While I am still delaying
Will He not pass me by?

Sweetly the tones are fallin'
Open the door for Me
If thou wilt heed My callin'
I will abide with thee"
Eddy Arnold,That Wonderful Mother of Mine,"The moon never beams without bringing me dreams
Of that wonderful mother of mine
The birds never sing but a message they bring
Of that wonderful mother of mine
Just to bring back the time, that was so sweet to me
Just to bring back the days, when I sat on her knee
You are a wonderful mother
Dear old Mother of mine
You'll hold a spot down deep in my heart
'Till the stars no longer shine
Your soul shall live on forever
On through the fields of time
For there'll never be another to me
Like that wonderful Mother of mine
I pray ev'ry night to our Father above
For that wonderful mother of mine
I ask Him to keep her as long as He can
That wonderful mother of mine
There are treasures on earth
That made life seem worthwhile
But there's none can compare to my mother's smile
You are a wonderful mother
Dear old Mother of mine
You'll hold a spot down deep in my heart
'Till the stars no longer shine
Your soul shall live on forever
On through the fields of time
For there'll never be another to me
Like that wonderful Mother of mine"

Stars are smilin', Molly darlin'
Through the mystic veil of night

When they hear me call your name

Molly, fairest, sweetest, dearest
Look up, darlin', tell me this
Do you love me, Molly darlin'?
Let your answer be a kiss"
Morgan Wallen,Don’t Think Jesus,"[Verse 1]
Boy gets a guitar and starts writin' songs
'Bout whiskey and women and gettin' too stoned
He got all three at the first show he played
Hometown said, ""I don't think Jesus done it that way""

[Verse 2]
Boy moves to city, lives fast and goes hard
Starts chasin' the devil through honky-tonk bars
Ignorin' the voices in his head that say
""I don't think Jesus done it this way""

[Chorus]
If I was Him I'd say, ""To hell with you, ain't no helpin' you""
Find someone else to give Heaven to, I'm tellin' you
I'd shame me, I'd blame me, I'd make me pay for my mistakes
But I don't think Jesus does it that way

[Verse 3]
Boy's all alone, got no one to turn to
He figures he'll pray, 'cause what else could he do?
He said, ""I wish You would've woke me up an easier way""
But I don't think Jesus does it that way

[Chorus]
If I was Him I'd say, ""To hell with you, ain't no helpin' you""
Find someone else to give Heaven to, I'm tellin' you
I'd shame me, I'd blame me, I'd make me pay for my mistakes
But I don't think Jesus does it that way

World likes to rear back and throw a few stones
So boy wants to throw a few stones of his own
But, Lord knows, I ain't perfect and it ain't my place
And I don't think Jesus done it that way

[Outro]
Are y'all sure that Jesus done it that way?"
Morgan Wallen,7 Summers,"[Verse 1]
Yeah, you used to talk about
Getting even further South
Somewhere where the summer lasted all year 'round
Probably got a big ol' diamond on your hand right now
Maybe a baby or a couple by now
Long driveway to a big white house

[Chorus]
But I wonder when you're drinking if you
Find yourself thinking about
That boy from East Tennessee
And I know we both knew better
But we still said forever
And that was seven summers
Of Coke and Southern Comfort
Were we dumb or just younger, who knows?
Back then, you used to love the river
And sippin' on a sixer with me
Does it ever make you sad to know
That was seven summers ago?

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I bet your daddy's so proud
Of how his little girl turned out
Think she dodged a bullet
Of a good old boy like me
'Cause I still
Go drinkin', same friends on Friday
Bought a few acres, couple roads off the highway
Guess you never saw things my way anyway

[Chorus]
But I wonder when you're drinking if you
Find yourself thinking about
That boy from East Tennessee
And I know we both knew better
But we still said forever
And that was seven summers
Of Coke and Southern Comfort
Were we dumb or just younger, who knows?
Back then, you used to love the river
And sippin' on a sixer with me
Does it ever make you sad to know
That was seven summers ago?

Ooh
Seven summers ago (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Seven summers ago (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)

And I know we both knew better
But we still said forever
And that was seven summers
Of Coke and Southern Comfort
Were we dumb or just younger, who knows?
Back then, you used to love the river
And sippin' on a sixer with me
Does it ever make you sad to know
That was seven summers ago?

Ooh
Seven summers ago (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Seven summers ago (Ooh, ooh-ooh)"
Morgan Wallen,Thought You Should Know,"[Verse 1]
What's goin' on, Mama? Somethin' just dawned on me
I ain't been home in some months
Been chasin' songs and women, makin' some bad decisions
God knows I'm drinkin' too much

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I know you've been worryin' 'bout me
You've been losin' sleep since '93

[Chorus]
I thought you should know, that all those prayers you thought you wasted on me
Must've finally made their way on through
I thought you should know, I got me a new girl down there in Jefferson City, and
She lets me fish whenever I want to
Yeah, I'm still proud of where I came from, still your only damn son, can you believe I'm on the radio?
Just thought you should know, thought you should know, thought you should know

[Verse 2]
Oh, by the way, Mama, didn't mean to ramblе on ya
How's everything back at home?
Yеah, how's that garden comin'? Is Dad still doin' dumb shit?
And how'd he keep you this long?

Yeah, I'm sorry that I called you so late
I just miss you, but anyways

I thought you should know, that all those prayers you thought you wasted on me
Must've finally made their way on through
I thought you should know, that I really like this girl down in Jefferson City, and
It turns out she's a lot like you
Yeah, I'm still proud of where I came from, still your only damn son, the bus is leavin' so I gotta roll
Just thought you should know, thought you should know, thought you should know

Morgan Wallen,Last Night,"[Intro]
Last night, we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said, but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But, baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet

[Verse 1]
No way it was our last night I kissed your lips
Make you grip the sheets with your fingertips
Last bottle of Jack, we split a fifth
Just talkin' 'bout life, goin' sip for sip
Yeah, you, you know you love to fight
And I say shit I don't mean
But I'm still gon' wake up wantin' you and me

[Chorus]
I know that last night, we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said, but we said it all

No way it was our last night (Last night)
No way it was our last night (Last night)

[Verse 2]
No way it was the last night that we break up
I see your tail lights in the dust
You call your mama, I call your bluff
In the middle of the night, pull it right back up
Yeah, my, my friends say, ""Let her go""
Your friends say, ""What the hell?""
I wouldn't trade your kind of love for nothin' else

[Chorus]
Oh, baby, last night, we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said, but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But, baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night, we said we'd had enough
I can't remember everything we said, but we said too much
I know you packed your shit and slammed the door right before you left
But, baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night (Last night)
No way it was our last night (Last night)

[Outro]
I know you said this time you really weren't comin' back again
But, baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night (Last night)
No way it was our last night (Last night)"
Morgan Wallen,Wasted on You,"[Verse 1]
I don't always wake up in the mornin', pour myself a strong one
Aw, but when I get lonely I do
Your memory gets to burnin', lean back on the bourbon
Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you

[Pre-Chorus]
Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again
It's all my fault, yeah, I dropped the ball
You're gone and I'm gone three sheets to the wind
Thinkin' 'bout all

[Chorus]
I've wasted on you
All of this time and all of this money
All of the these sorries I don't owe you honey
All of these miles on this Chevy, and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent wasted on you
Wasted on you

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I swore this one'd be different, my heart wouldn't listen
To my head and these boots on my feet
Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again
That's why I've been

[Chorus]
Wasted on you
All of this time and all of this money
All these sorries I don't owe you, honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent wasted on you
Wasted on you

[Bridge]
Like this pile of your stuff that's packed up in a bag
Right down to the flame of this match
Wasted on you, wasted on you
Wasted on you, wasted on you

[Chorus]
Wasted on you
All of this time and all of this money
All these sorries I don't owe you, honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent wasted on you
Wasted on you

[Outro]
Wasted on you, wasted on you"
Morgan Wallen,Somebody’s Problem,"[Verse 1]
A 'Bama red 4Runner pulled into the party
With a 30-A sticker on the back windshield
Two-tone tank top slippin' off her shoulder
Kinda girl when she steps out, the world stands still

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I know where this is goin'
I already know it

[Chorus]
She's somebody's problem, somebody's goodbye
Somebody's last call number that they can't find
Somebody's best day, somebody's worst night
Somebody's reason for leavin' on the porch light
Thinkin' 'bout them tan lines and I'm thinkin' damn, I'd
Love to drown in them heartbreaker blue eyes
Shе's somebody's problem and somebody's problеm's
About to be mine
About to be mine

[Verse 2]
Kinda girl once you've had her, you can't stand to lose her
Kinda girl where your friends tell you don't F it up
Kinda girl that goes from tryin' to just to get her number
To slidin' through the summer to talkin' 'bout love

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I think I'm likin' where it's goin'
I'd like to try me some of

[Chorus]
Somebody's problem, somebody's goodbye
Somebody's last call number that they can't find
Somebody's best day, somebody's worst night
Somebody's reason for leavin' on the porch light
Thinkin' 'bout them tan lines and I'm thinkin' damn, I'd
Love to drown in them heartbreaker blue eyes
She's somebody's problem and somebody's problem's
About to be mine
About to be mine

[Bridge]
Oh, hey baby, don't just keep me wishin'
Oh, let me get to fixin'

[Chorus]
Somebody's problem, somebody's goodbye
Somebody's last call number that they can't find
Somebody's best day, somebody's worst night
Somebody's reason for leavin' on the porch light
Thinkin' 'bout them tan lines and I'm thinkin' damn, I'd
Love to drown in them heartbreaker blue eyes
She's somebody's problem and somebody's problem's
About to be mine
About to be mine
About to be mine
About to be mine"
Morgan Wallen,Cover Me Up,"[Verse 1]
A heart on the run keeps a hand on a gun
Can't trust anyone
I was so sure what I needed was more
Tried to shoot out the sun
The days when we raged, we flew off the page
Such damage was done
But I made it through, 'cause somebody knew
I was meant for someone

[Chorus]
So, girl, leave your boots by the bed, we ain't leavin' this room
'Til someone needs medical help or the magnolias bloom
It's cold in this house and I ain't goin' out to chop wood
So, cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good

[Verse 2]
I put your faith to the test when I tore off your dress
In Richmond on high
I sobered up, I swore off that stuff
Forever this time
And the old lover's sing, “I thought it'd be me
Who helped him get home”
But home was a dream, one that I'd never seen
'Til you came along

[Chorus]
So, girl, hang your dress out to dry, we ain't leavin' this room
'Til Percy Priest breaks open wide and the river runs through
And carries this house on its stones like a piece of driftwood
So, cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
So, girl, leave your boots by the bed, we ain't leavin' this room
'Til someone needs medical help or the magnolias bloom
It's cold in this house and I ain't goin' out to chop wood
So, cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good

[Outro]
So, cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good"

I need someone that I'd be proud
To take on back to my hometown

To lonely nights
Even when she's up against me

It feels like there's nobody with me
And I'm still empty, yeah

Morgan Wallen,Whiskey Glasses,"[Verse 1]
Poor me, pour me another drink
'Cause I don't wanna feel a thing
No more, hell nah

Poor me, pour me another round
Line 'em up and knock 'em down
Two more let's go
'Cause I ain't never hurt like this before

[Pre-Chorus]

Or wear a ring without her
Don't wanna hit the karaoke bar
Can't sing without her
So make them drinks strong
'Cause brother she's gone
And if I'm ever gonna move on

I'ma need some whiskey glasses
'Cause I don't wanna see the truth
She's probably making out on the couch right now
With someone new
Yeah, I'ma need some whiskey glasses
If I'm gonna make it through
If I'ma be single
I'ma need a double shot of that heartbreak proof
And see the world through whiskey glasses

And see the world through whiskey glasses

Last call

Morgan Wallen,Lies Lies Lies (Abbey Road Sessions),"[Verse 1]
I don't come down with the Sun
I won't hate myself when the mornin' comes
No thoughts of your body runnin' through my head
No bottle of bourbon beside the bed, 'cause

[Verse 2]
It wasn't no thing to give you up
I never reach for you in another touch
Don't ever think about you with him
And girl, tonight I won't call again and again
Ain't nothin' but—

[Chorus]
Lies, lies, lies
Look into my eyes, eyes, eyes
I'm still a fool for you
Nothin' I wouldn't do for you
Lies, lies, lies
Girl, I'm on a downhill dive
Habits and hard heartbreaks are hard to break
So I just tell the same old lies, liеs, lies
Yeah, baby, I can try, try, try

[Verse 3]
To act like I don't givе a damn, but I do
Bet you're missin' me bad as I miss you
Snowballs to a phone call
Soundin' somethin' stupid
Baby, 'cause the truth is
The 90-proof is tellin' me—

[Chorus]
Lies, lies, lies
Look into my eyes, eyes, eyes
I'm still a fool for you
Nothin' I wouldn't do for you
Lies, lies, lies
Girl, I'm on a downhill dive
Habits and hard heartbreaks are hard to break
So I just tell the same old lies, lies, lyin' to myself
Why, why, why in the hell
Do I keep sayin', ""I can get you back""?
That's about as honest as sayin' that

I don't come down with the Sun
I won't hate myself when the mornin' comes
Them ain't nothin' but—

Lies, lies, lies
Look into my eyes, eyes, eyes

Morgan Wallen,Up Down,"[Verse 1: Morgan Wallen]
It's Friday after 5, got here just in time
Went ahead and wet a line 'fore I went and lost my mind
I ain't been here long, but the bobber's in the pond
Going up down, up, down, up, down
Tonight, we're gonna raise a whole lot more than cane
'Cause there's money in the bank and tomorrow's Saturday
So if they pass that fifth of Jack this way
I turn it up, down, up, down, up, down

[Chorus: Morgan Wallen & Florida Georgia Line]
We just holding it down here in BFE
Still rolling around with a burnt CD
Free Bird, five minutes deep
Head bobbing up, down, up, down, up, down
We got what we got, we don't need the rest
Can turn this parking lot into a party
With an ice chest, dancing, cold beer
Man, we live it up, down, up, down
We live it up down here

[Post-Chorus: Morgan Wallen & Tyler Hubbard]
What you know about it, T-Hubb?
What up, baby?

[Verse 2: Florida Georgia Line]
Yeah, the girls, they hit the spot, even hotter when it's hot
If you can't buy her a yacht, but still proud of what you got
'Cause when the day's done, red neck is from the sun
Going up, down, up, down, up, down

[Chorus: Morgan Wallen & Florida Georgia Line]
We just holding it down here in BFE
Still rolling around with a burnt CD
Free Bird, five minutes deep
Head bobbing up, down, up, down, up, down
We got what we got, we don't need the rest
Can turn this parking lot into a party
With an ice chest, dancing, cold beer
Man, we live it up, down, up, down
We live it up, down here

[Bridge: Morgan Wallen & Florida Georgia Line]
Somebody pass that fifth of Camp this way
I'll turn it up, down, up, down, up, down

We just holding it down here in BFE
Still rolling around with a burnt CD
Free Bird, five minutes deep
Head bobbing up, down, up, down, up, down
We got what we got, we don't need the rest
Can turn this parking lot into a party
With an ice chest, dancing, cold beer
Man, we live it up, down, up, down
We live it up, down here"
Morgan Wallen,Still Goin Down,"[Verse 1]
The way I talk, I guess I got it from my pops
Product of some kneelin' down
In a town where the doors don't lock
And there's a million other people like me
From a scene a little more podunk than pop
I didn't choose being born in the sticks
And I'll be damned if I sound like something I ain't
For some folks, a backroad gets old
But for me, it just can't

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm from a small town, southern drawl crowd
We're sippin' clear, drinkin' beer on a Friday night
Every country girl got on her cutoffs
Shakin' her hips, take a trip, buddy tell me I'm a liar
Still circle up big trucks around a fire
Still kickin' up some dust behind the tires
Call it cliché, but hey, just take it from me
It's still goin' down out in the country

[Verse 2]
Somewhere now, someone's out there
Sippin' on some hundred proof
Every day, a baby's born with some baby blues
A good ol' boy's got on his faded boots
Workin' a nine to five
I'm just another southern hell raiser
Ain't breakin' ground
Makin' sound for them drop-it-down tailgaters
But y'all, that's all I know to say
So if you think I'm full of it, ain't done it, check the resume

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm from a small town, southern drawl crowd
We're sippin' clear, drinkin' beer on a Friday night
Every country girl got on her cutoffs
Shakin' her hips, take a trip, buddy tell me I'm a liar
Still circle up big trucks around a fire
Still kickin' up some dust behind the tires
Call it cliché, but hey, just take it from me
It's still goin' down out in the country

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm from a small town, southern drawl crowd
We're sippin' clear, drinkin' beer on a Friday night
Every country girl got on her cutoffs
Shakin' her hips, take a trip, buddy tell me I'm a liar
Still circle up big trucks around a fire
Still kickin' up some dust behind the tires
Call it cliché, but hey, just take it from me
It's still goin' down out in the country"
Morgan Wallen,Sand in My Boots,"[Verse 1]
She asked me where I's from
I said, ""Somewhere ya never been to
Little town outside of Knoxville""
Hidden by some dogwood trees
She tried talkin' with my accent
We held hands and waded into
That blue water, she left her flip-flops
By my Red Wings on the beach

[Chorus]
Yeah, but now I'm dodgin' potholes
In my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado
Headed right back to my roots
Somethin' 'bout the way she kissеd me
Tells me shе'd love Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me
Was some sand in my boots

[Verse 2]
I said, ""Let's go shoot tequila""
So, we walked back to that beach bar
She said, ""Don't cowboys drink whiskey?"" (Huh)
So, we drank bottom shelf
She said, ""Damn, that sky looks perfect""
I said, ""Girl, you've never seen stars
Like the ones back home""
And she said, ""Maybe I should, see 'em for myself""

[Chorus]
Yeah, but now I'm dodgin' potholes
In my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado
Headed right back to my roots
Somethin' 'bout the way she kissed me
Tells me she'd love Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me
Was some sand in my boots

[Bridge]
I said, ""Meet me in the mornin'""
And she told me I was crazy
Yeah, but I still thought that maybe she'd show up

[Chorus]
Aw, but now I'm dodgin' potholes
In my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado
Headed right back to my roots
Somethin' 'bout the way she kissed me
Tells me she'd love Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me
Was some sand in my boots
Yeah, but all I brought back with me
Was some sand in my boots"
Morgan Wallen,Chasin’ You,"[Verse 1]
We used to chase that Chattanooga freight
Couple of kids in a Chevrolet
Catch a little air when we cross the tracks
Sipping on something from a paper sack
You hang your shirt on that maple limb
Slipping through the moon to the river bend
Wasn't very long I was jumping in, jumping in
I guess I'm still doing now what I was doing then

[Chorus]
Chasin' you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasin' you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasin' that freedom, chasing' that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasin' that you and me, I only see in my rearview
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasin' you, still chasin' you

[Verse 2]
You always used to talk about LA
I heard you got as far as Santa Fe
Well you know I tried to track you down
I only got as far as Guitar Town
Singing about a girl I used to know, used to know
Well you should know that I haven't given up
I'm just on your radio

[Chorus]
Chasin' you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasin' you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasin' that freedom, chasin' that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasin' that you and me, I only see in my rearview
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasin' you, still chasin' you

[Chorus]
Chasin' you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasin' you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasin' that freedom, chasin' that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasin' that you and me, I only see in my rearview
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasin' you, still chasin' you

Still chasin' you, still chasin' you"
Morgan Wallen,865,"[Verse 1]
Jack D, there's a seven on the label
One glass on the living room table
Phone face down, Church up loud
Was tryna drown you out tonight
But first sip, I could feel you on my shoulder
The Tennessee heat had me feelin' colder
Thought a drink would get you off my mind

[Chorus]
But this bottle tastes like 865-409-1021
Yeah, one last time, don't think twice
Girl, just pick it up and come over
Give the bedroom door a little closure
I know I told you I wouldn't call and I tried
But this bottle tastes like 865 (409-1021)
This bottle tastes like 865 (409-1021)

[Verse 2]
You might think I don't really want you with me
You might tell me to empty out my whiskey
Or try changin' what I'm holdin' in my hand
Try another liquor, try another brand
But it don't matter if I got my lips on a different drink on a different night
Yeah, the second that I take a sip all I'm gonna think

[Chorus]
Is this bottle tastes like 865-409-1021
Yeah, one last time, don't think twice
Girl, just pick it up and come over
Give the bedroom door a little closure
I know I told you I wouldn't call and I tried
But this bottle tastes like 865 (409-1021)
This bottle tastes like 865 (409-1021)

[Bridge]
Thought a drink would get you off my mind
I ain't sayin' I love you, but I might

[Chorus]
'Cause this bottle tastes like 865-409-1021
Yeah, one last time, don't think twice
Girl, just pick it up and come over
Give the bedroom door a little closure
I know I told you I wouldn't call and I tried
But this bottle tastes like 865 (409-1021)
This bottle tastes like 865 (409-1021)
This bottle tastes like 865 (409-1021)
This bottle tastes like 865 (409-1021)"
Morgan Wallen,I Guess,"Lyrics  From Snippet

[Verse]
You say I'll never change
Just to go around town with some gasoline
Just tryin' to bum a flame
Gon' burn the whole place down
And how do you explain, ever fallin' in love with a guy like me in the first place?
Turn around say that I'm the worst thing

[Chorus]
I guess I'm the problem
And you're miss never do no wrong
If I'm so awful, then why'd you stick around this long?
And if it's the whiskey, then why you keep on pullin' it off the shelf?
You hate that when you look at me, you halfway see yourself
And it got me thinkin'
If I'm the problem, then you might be the reason"
Morgan Wallen,The Way I Talk,"[Verse 1]
It's got a touch of the town where I grew up
Something in it them California girls love
Some people like to make a little fun of
The way I talk
It gets slower after three or four cold beers
And gets louder when I'm cheerin' on the Volunteers
Folks know I'm country, when they hear
The way I talk

[Chorus]
It sounds a little bit like my daddy
It don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No, I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi roads
It's the only way I know
Man it ain't my fault
I just live the way I talk

[Verse 2]
Yeah it's, ""Yes sir, no ma'am, y'all come back, now""
Fightin' words if you run my last name down
I ain't ashamed, matter of fact I'm damn proud
Of the way I talk, y'all

[Chorus]
It sounds a little bit like my daddy
It don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No, I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi roads
It's the only way I know
Man it ain't my fault
I just live the way I talk

[Bridge]
Slow, like a Sunday morning service back home
And kinda sweet when I got a girl to love on
If you know me, you know

[Chorus]
It sounds a little bit like my daddy
It don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi roads
It's the only way I know
Man it ain't my fault
I just live the way I talk
The way I talk"
Morgan Wallen,More Than My Hometown,"[Verse 1]
Girl, our mamas are best friends and so are we
The whole town's rooting for us like the home team
Most likely to settle down
Plant a few roots real deep and let 'em grow
But we can't stop this real world from spinnin' us
Your bright lights called, I don't blame you for pickin' up
Your big dream bags are all packed up and ready to go
But I just need you to know

[Chorus]
That I love you more than a California sunset
More than a beer when you ain't twenty-one yet
More than a Sunday morning Lord
Turnin' some poor lost souls 'round, and Hallelujah bound
Yeah, I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But, baby, this might be the last time I get to lay you down
'Cause I can't love you more than my hometown

[Verse 2]
I ain't the runaway kind, I can't change that
My heart's stuck in these streets like the train tracks
City sky ain't the same black
Ain't that a map dot shame, man, to think that

[Chorus]
I love you more than a California sunset
More than a beer when you ain't twenty-one yet
More than a Sunday morning Lord
Turnin' some poor lost souls around, and Hallelujah bound
Yeah, I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But, baby, this might be the last time I get to lay you down
'Cause I can't love you more than my hometown

[Bridge]
Yeah, you got a wild in your eyes that I just wasn't born with
I'm a same gas station cup of coffee in the mornin'
I need a house on the hill, girl, not in 'em
So hang onto these words 'til them avenues help you forget 'em

[Chorus]
'Cause I love you more than a California sunset
I love you more in a twenty-dollar sundress
Hate that loaded down car you got your keys in
Girl, but I hate even more that you're leavin'
'Cause I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But that ain't you and me so I guess I'll see you around
'Cause I can't love you more than my hometown

[Outro]
Love you more than my hometown
Love you more than my hometown
Love you more, baby, love you more"
Morgan Wallen,Tennessee Fan,"[Verse 1]
They beat us every damn year
It's been a minute since we pulled out a win
I loaded the truck down with beer
Drove down to watch ’em do it again
And they did so we went to the bar right after
Met a girl with a houndstooth print of her chapter on her shirt
And it turned into talkin' all night
She came back with me across the Vol' state line

[Chorus]
Guess the joke’s on Alabama
'Cause they lost big this time
I got the number one pick, blonde hair, red lips
Brought her over to the other side
A little deep south Delta Gamma
Done found a Smoky Mountain man
Yeah, she was raised Roll Tide 'til the day she died
But ever since that night, she's been a Tennessee fan

[Verse 2]
She likes ridin' on them windin' roads
The smell of sweet pine in the air
I took her about as high as you could go, huh
You can still see the Tuscaloosa from there
And all them girls back home say, ""How could you love him?""
All them boys probably hate me for takin' her from 'em
Lord knows her mom and daddy’s jaw would drop
If they heard her singin’ every word of ""Rocky Top""

[Chorus]
Guess the joke's on Alabama
’Cause they lost big this time
I got the number one pick, blonde hair, red lips
Brought her over to the other side
A little deep south Delta Gamma
Done found a Smoky Mountain man
Yeah, she was raised Roll Tide 'til the day she died
But ever since that night, she's been a Tennessee fan

[Bridge]
Oh
Yeah, it's alright, let’s just call it even
'Cause she's all mine and she ain't ever leavin'
And she's damn fine in orange every weekend from now on
Yeah, she found home

[Chorus]
Looks like the joke's on Alabama
'Cause they lost big this time
I got the number one pick, blonde hair, red lips
Brought her over to the other side
A little deep south Delta Gamma
Done found a Smoky Mountain man
Yeah, she was raised Roll Tide 'til the day she died
But ever since that night, she's been a Tennessee fan
Oh, she's been a Tennessee fan"
Morgan Wallen,‘98 Braves,"[Verse 1]
I remember sittin' at that house, livin' room couch
Thinkin' no way them boys wouldn't win
Between them big three pitchers, Andruw and Chipper
It was gonna be hard to keep up with the Jones's
But as fate would have it, that Atlanta magic
Got put out by them damn Padres
I guess destiny ain't always meant to be
Kinda like you and me that day

[Chorus]
We got close, but close doesn't cut it
Had a good run, to end up with nothin'
But a 3x5 that you hide in a drawer
We swung for the fences and came up short
Yeah, you win some, you lose some, it ain't always home runs
And that's just the way life plays
If we were a team, and love was a game
We'd have been the '98 Braves

[Verse 2]
Had that whole town believin'
Damn, girl, I even had that talk to your dad, man to man
But just like that season
Girl, you and me didn't end with a ring on a hand

[Chorus]
We got close, but close doesn't cut it
Had a good run, to end up with nothin'
But a 3x5 that you hide in a drawer
We swung for the fences, and came up short
Yeah, you win some, you lose some, it ain't always home runs
And that's just the way life plays
If we were a team, and love was a game
We'd have been the '98 Braves
98 Braves
You win some, you lose some, it ain't always home runs
Girl, it could've gone either way
But if we were a team, and love was a game
We'd have been the '98 Braves
If we were a team, and love was a game
We'd have been the '98 Braves
'98 Braves
Oh, yeah, girl, we'd have been the '98 Braves
'98 Braves, we'd have been the '98 Braves

[Outro]
I remember sittin' at that house, livin' room couch
Thinkin' no way them boys wouldn't win"
Morgan Wallen,Thinkin’ Bout Me,"[Verse 1]
Don't know where you at, don't know where you've been
Don't know nothin' 'bout that boy you're into
Don't feel bad for you but I feel bad for him
And all the hell you gon' be puttin' him through
Probably tell him we're a burnt out flame
Probably tell him that I ain't been on your mind
How I ain't nothin' but a long gone thing
You can cuss my name, but baby, don't you lie

[Chorus]
When you're tasting what he's drinking, are you thinkin' 'bout me?
When you're ridin' where he's drivin', are you missin' my street?
Every time you close your eyes, tell me, who do you see?
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Comin' over tonight, wish that truck in your drive was mine
Just like you know it's supposed to be
When you're up in his bed, am I up in your head?
Makin' you crazy, tell me, baby, are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Are you thinkin' 'bout, are you thinkin' 'bout
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?

[Verse 2]
Do you hide your phone? Did you change my name?
When he wants to go to our go-to place
Do you tell him you can't? Then go out of your way
To be somewhere, any damn where I ain't

[Chorus]
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?
When you're ridin' where he's drivin', are you missin' my street?
Every time you close your eyes, tell me, who do you see?
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Comin' over tonight, wish that truck in your drive was mine
Just like you know it's supposed to be
When you're up in his bed, am I up in your head?
Makin' you crazy, tell me, baby, are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Are you thinkin' 'bout, are you thinkin' 'bout
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?

[Bridge]
Don't know where you at
But girl, I know where you oughta be

[Chorus]
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?
When you're ridin' where he's drivin', are you missing my street?
Every time you close your eyes, tell me, who do you see?
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Comin' over tonight, wish that truck in your drive was mine
Just like you know it's supposed to be
When you're up in his bed, am I up in your head?
Makin' you crazy, tell me, baby, are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Yeah, are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Are you thinkin' 'bout me?"
Morgan Wallen,One Thing At A Time,"[Verse 1]
Somebody hand me a cigarette
I know I ain't had one in over a week
Somebody pour me a double shot
Been gettin' better by the day, but tonight I drink

[Pre-Chorus]
You say I gotta get over you and get sober too
I got a lot of habits I gotta kick
But weigh out all your options and take your pick

[Chorus]
I can either burn the bar down
Or I can take your number out my phone
I can give you up right now
And never want you back long as I'm half-stoned
If you want me to quit you, want me to get you
Outta my heart and, baby, off my mind
I hate to tell you, girl, but I'm only quittin' one thing at a time

[Verse 2]
I know I got me some problems
About a thousand memories I gotta forgеt
But if I'm gonna solve 'em
Baby, I'll take all thе help I can get

[Pre-Chorus]
If you ain't gonna kiss me
Then I'll take some whiskey, some Grizzly
Nicotine amphetamines too
You want me to stop some of that
Or you want me to stop lovin' you?
Hey, what you want me to do?

[Chorus]
I can either burn the bar down
Or I can take your number out my phone
I can give you up right now
And never want you back long as I'm half-stoned
If you want me to quit you, want me to get you
Outta my heart and, baby, off my mind
I hate to tell you, girl, but I'm only quittin' one thing at a time

[Post-Chorus]
Aw, yeah, I hate to tell you
Aw, yeah, I hate to tell you

[Bridge]
I ain't no Superman, I'm just the way I am
If I'm gonna move on, then I need me somethin' in my hand
Ain't nothin' wrong with that
And if you ain't comin' back

[Chorus]
I can either burn the bar down
Or I can take your number out my phone
I can give you up right now
And never want you back long as I'm half-stoned
If you want me to quit you, want me to get you
Outta my heart and, baby, off my mind
I hate to tell you, girl, but I'm only quittin' one thing at a time

[Post-Chorus]
Aw, yeah, I hate to tell you
Aw, yeah, I hate to tell you
Aw, yeah, I hate to tell you"
Morgan Wallen,Livin’ the Dream,"[Verse 1]
Mama don't pray for my success anymore, yeah
But mama still prays for me
Seein' the world ain't really seein' the world
Through a window from A to B
Between alcohol and women and Adderall and adrenaline
I don't ever get no rest
Signed my life away to be the life of the party
Yeah, to everybody else

[Chorus]
I look like a rockstar, in and out of cop cars
Livin' out a suitcase, trashin' hotel bars
If I see the sunrise, it's 'cause I stayed up all night
Drinkin' 'cause I need to, damn it, what a good life
Judgin' by my long hair, you might think I don't care
Sittin' here, sippin' and bitchin' about a spot where
Peoplе would kill to be, kill to be, kill to be
But y'all, it ain't as good as it seems, this livin' thе dream is
Killin' me, killin' me, killin' me
It's killin' me, killin' me, killin' me

[Verse 2]
Another day, another venue
There's trouble to get into
And love ain't on the menu again
Lonely as an eagle
I meet a thousand people
Who think I got a thousand friends

[Refrain]
Ooh
There's a stranger in the mirror
Ooh
But accordin' to the pictures

[Chorus]
I'm a rockstar, in and out of cop cars
Livin' out a suitcase, trashin' hotel bars
If I see the sunrise, it's 'cause I stayed up all night
Drinkin' 'cause I need to, damn it, what a good life
Judgin' by my long hair, you might think I don't care
Sittin' here, sippin' and bitchin' about a spot where
People would kill to be, kill to be, kill to be
But y'all, it ain't as good as it seems, this livin' the dream is
Killin' me, killin' me, killin' me
It's killin' me, killin' me, killin' me
Killin' me, killin' me, killin' me

[Refrain]
Ooh
There's a stranger in the mirror
Ooh
But accordin' to the pictures

Killin' me, killin' me, killin' me"
Morgan Wallen,Not Good At Not,"[Verse 1]
Maybe it's your bad girl, underneath that sweet smile
Like a peek of black lace that nobody but me sees
Just a trace of all the possibilities
Maybe it's the quarter moon, maybe it's the quart of wine
That we haven't even touched yet, baby don't need it
Everything you're doing, girl is my weakness

[Chorus]
I'm not good at not kissin' again
When you're leanin' it on in a little closer
I'm not good at not getting sidetracked
When your tank top strap's slippin' off of your shoulder
Oh-oh, girl, I try to be, but I ain't that tough
I'm not good at not fallin' in love, fallin' in love, fallin' in love

[Verse 2]
You know what you're doin' girl
You know what it does to me
When you turn on that song, and turn the lights down
Baby I'm gone, before the part about you
Dancin' in slow motion with my hands on your hips
Now you got me going right where I can't resist

[Chorus]
I'm not good at not kissin' again
When you're leanin' it on in a little closer
I'm not good at not getting sidetracked
When your tank top strap's slipping off of your shoulder
Oh-oh girl, I try to be, but I ain't that tough
I'm not good at not fallin' in love, fallin' in love, fallin' in love

[Bridge]
Can't tell you no
Can't say goodbye
Can't hold a little bit back even if I tried
'Cause when I look in your eyes

[Chorus]
I'm not good at not kissin' again
When you're leanin' it on in a little closer
I'm not good at not getting sidetracked
When your tank top strap's slipping off of your shoulder
Girl, I try to be, but I ain't that tough
I'm not good at not fallin' in love, fallin' in love, fallin' in love"
Roy Clark,"Yesterday, When I Was Young","Yesterday when I was young
The taste of life was sweet as rain upon my tongue
I teased at life as if it were a foolish game
The way the evening breeze may tease a candle flame
The thousand dreams I dreamed, the splendid things I planned
I always built alas on weak and shifting sand
I lived by night and shunned the naked light of the day
And only now I see how the years ran away

Yesterday when I was young
So many drinking songs were waiting to be sung
So many wayward pleasures lay in store for me
And so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to see
I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out
I never stopped to think what life was all about
And every conversation I can now recall
Concerned itself with me and nothing else at all

Yesterday the moon was blue
And every crazy day brought something new to do
I used my magic age as if it were a wand
And never saw the waste and emptiness beyond
The game of love I played with arrogance and pride
And every flame I lit too quickly quickly died
The friends I made all seemed somehow to drift away
And only I am left on stage to end the play
There are so many songs in me that won't be sung
I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue
The time has come for me to pay for
Yesterday when I was young..."
Roy Clark,I Never Picked Cotton,"I never picked cotton
But my mother did and my brother did
And my sister did and my daddy died young
Workin' in the coal mine

When I was just a baby too little for a cotton sack
I played in the dirt while the others worked till they couldn't straighten their backs
And I made myself a promise when I was big enough to run
That I'd never stay a single day in that Oklahoma sun

And I never picked cotton
But my mother did and my brother did
And my sister did and my daddy died young
Workin' in the coal mine

Folks said I grew up early and in the farm that couldn't hold me then
So I stole ten bucks and a pickup truck and I never went back again
And it was fast cars and whiskey long haired girls and fun
I had everything that money could bring and I took it all with a gun

But I never picked cotton
But my mother did and my brother did
And my sister did and my daddy died young
Workin' in the coal mine

It was Saturday night in Memphis when a redneck grabbed my shirt
And when he said go back in your cotton sack I let 'im dyin' in the dirt
They'd take me in the mornin' to the gallows just outside
And in the time I've got there ain't a hullava lot that I can look back on with pride

But I never picked cotton
But my mother did and my brother did
And my sister did and my daddy died young
Workin' in the coal mine

But I never picked cotton
But my mother did and my brother did
And my sister did and my daddy died young
Workin' in the coal mine..."
Roy Clark,If I Had to Do It All Over Again,"We're not as young as we used to be
But baby I don't mind
'Cause growing with you is gonna be
Full of life and good times

And if I had it to do all over again I'd do it with you
I won't want to miss a thing that we've been through
Baby nothing can compare with the good love that we've shared
And if I had to do it all over again I'd do it with you

Looking back on life I can't complain
It ain't been easy but don't you know
We still had sunshine even when it rained
And we've shared a love you have known

And if I had it to do all over again I'd do it with you
I won't want to miss a thing that we've been through
Baby nothing can compare with the good love that we've shared
And if I had to do it all over again I'd do it with you

And if I had it to do all over again I'd do it with you
I won't want to miss a thing that we've been through
Baby nothing can compare with the good love that we've shared
And if I had to do it all over again I'd do it with you..."
Roy Clark,Thank God and Greyhound,"I've made a small fortune and you squandered it all
You shamed me till I feel about one inch tall
But I thought I loved you and I hoped you would change
So I gritted my teeth and didn't complain

Now you come to me with a simple goodbye
You tell me you're leaving but you won't tell me why
Now we're here at the station and you're getting on
And all I can think of is thank God and Greyhound you're gone

Thank God and Greyhound you're gone
I didn't know how much longer I could go on
Watching you take the respect out of me
Watching you make a total wreck out of me
That big diesel motor is a-playing my song
Thank God and Greyhound you're gone

Thank God and Greyhound you're gone
I didn't know how much longer I could go on
Watching you take the respect out of me
Watching you make a total wreck out of me
That big diesel motor is a playing my song
Thank God and Greyhound you're gone

Oh, thank God and Greyhound you're gone
That load on my mind got lighter when you got on
That shiny old bus is a beautiful sight
With the black smoke a rolling up around the tail lights
It may sound kinda cruel but I've been silent too long
Thank God and Greyhound you're gone

Thank God and Greyhound you're gone..."
Roy Clark,Right or Left at Oak Street,"The alarm rang at seven this morning
The same time it did yesterday
Seven-thirty is my breakfast time
And I know what the wife's gonna say

The Crawfords next door got a new swimming pool
The Millers got a color TV
Mr. Wilson's job is not good as yours
But his wife dresses better than me

I get to the school at eight o-five
And drop off the kids at the gate
Then I drive past the clock outside the bank
It's exactly a quarter past eight

When I reach the stop sign at Oak Street
The same thought crosses my mind
Should I turn right like I always have
Or left and leave it behind?

Right or left at Oak Street
That's the choice I face everyday
And I don't know which takes more courage
The staying or the running away

A left turn would take me to somewhere
Leave alarm clocks and schedules behind
And the world wouldn't care if I'm not somewhere
At some particular time

Where a man can do what he wants to do
And no one expects him to give
All of his time to the same old routine
In the one life that he has to live

I'm not sure which way is the best way
But I've always turned right before
And it might be strange at the end of the day
If they weren't there at the door

A man must make his decisions
But he must consider the stakes
For every mans life is a gamble
It depends on the turn that he takes

Right or left at Oak Street
That's the choice I face everyday
And I don't know which takes more courage
The staying or the running away..."
Roy Clark,Come Live With Me,"Come live with me and be my love
Share my bread and wine
Be wife to me, be life to me, be mine
Come live with me and be my love
Let our dreams combine
Be mate to me, be fate to me, be mine

With these hands I'll build a roof
To shield your head
And with these hands
I'll carve the wood for a baby bed
Come live with me and be my love
Share my bread and wine
Be part of me, the heart of me, be mine

I'll try to do my best for you
I promise you
I'll laugh with you, I'll cry with you, my whole life through
Come live with me and be my love
Share my bread and wine
Be part of me, the heart of me, be mine...."
Roy Clark,Tips of My Fingers,"I reached out my arms and I touched you
With soft words I whispered your name
I had your love on the tips of my fingers
Oh, but that was as close as I came

My eyes had a vision of sweet lips
Yielding beneath my command
I had your love on the tips of my fingers
But I let it slip right through my hands
But I let it slip right through my hands

Somebody took you when I wasn't looking
And I should have known from the start
That it's a long, long way from the tips of my fingers
To the love hidden deep in your heart
To the love hidden deep in your heart

I had your love on the tips of my fingers
But I let you slip right through my hands

Yes, I let you slip right through my hands..."
Roy Clark,Daddy Don’t You Walk So Fast,"The love between the two of us was dying
And it got so bad I knew I had to leave
But halfway down that driverway when I turned around I saw
My little daughter running after me

Crying daddy won't you walk so fast
Daddy won't you walk so fast
Daddy, slow down some 'cause you're making me run
Daddy won't you walk so fast

It broke my heart to tell my little daughter
That her daddy had to run and catch a plane
She had no way of knowing I was leaving home for good
And I turned around there was again crying

Crying daddy won't you walk so fast
Daddy won't you walk so fast
Daddy, slow down some 'cause you're making me run
Daddy won't you walk so fast

If only for the sake of my baby
I had to turn back home right there and then
And try to start a new life with the mother of my child
I couldn't bear to hear those words again

She cries daddy won't you walk so fast
Daddy won't you walk so fast
Daddy, slow down some 'cause you're making me run
Daddy won't you walk so fast

Daddy won't you walk so fast
Daddy won't you walk so fast
Daddy, slow down some 'cause you're making me run
Daddy won't you walk so fast..."
Roy Clark,Somewhere Between Love and Tomorrow,"You gave your love completely
And warmed my life, so cold
But she stills lives between us
And our story must be told

Today, she thinks I love her
But tomorrow, we'll be through
And somewhere between love and tomorrow
She'll have to know about you

We vowed to love forever
And never be untrue
But time can change and rearrange
Your world from green to blue

But then you came to love me
And you made the sun shine through
And somewhere between love and tomorrow
She'll have to know about you

It's sad for love to die now
After all that we've been through
But somewhere between love and tomorrow
I fell in love with you"
Roy Clark,Honeymoon Feeling,"I still get that honeymoon feeling
After all these years my heart goes reeling
Every time you touch me it's the living end
I still get that honeymoon feeling
I can still hear those wedding bells ringing
Every time we love I get that honeymoon feeling again

It seems like only yesterday you walked into my life
And answered all my prayers and made my dreams come true
And even though it's been some time since I made you my wife
Every day I find I'm even more in love with you

I still get that honeymoon feeling
After all these years my heart goes reeling
Every time you touch me it's the living end
I still get that honeymoon feeling
I can still hear those wedding bells ringing
Every time we love I get that honeymoon feeling again

I'm thankful that I wake up with an angel by my side
You make my world a better place to be
And though were far from newlyweds you're still my brushing bride
But most of all I'm glad you show just how much you need me

I still get that honeymoon feeling
After all these years my heart goes reeling
Every time you touch me it's the living end
I still get that honeymoon feeling
I can still hear those wedding bells ringing
Every time we love I get that honeymoon feeling again

I still get that honeymoon feeling
After all these years my heart goes reeling
Every time you touch me it's the living end
I still get that honeymoon feeling
I can still hear those wedding bells ringing
Every time we love I get that honeymoon feeling again..."
Roy Clark,Love Is Just a State of Mind,"I'll stay with you if you say stay
But I must leave you when I must
I'll stay as long as we can last
And leave when laughter turns to rust

The day the fireworks fail to flash
And mental light refuse to shine
We'll know it's time for someone else
For love is just a state of mind

If you can say it like it is
And if I like to hear it said
I'll carve your image on my heart
And make sure that your soul is fed

But one day the words break step
And if one ego lags behind
You column left, I'll column right
For love is just a state of mind

Keep yourself but give me room
I want some place to think aloud
And if you can your chain will reach
From ocean floor to shining cloud

When the shackles feel too tight
Or when restrictions start to blind
It's time to breathe instead of choke
For love is just a state of mind

If my words are worry things
And if I make your mouth turn down
Then take your apprehensive love
And leave me now without a sound

But if you take me as I am
And love me one day at a time
I may stay a thousand years
For love is just a state of mind

For love is just a state of mind..."
Roy Clark,A Simple Thing as Love,"When you come across unto me with your hair the tangled grass of evening breezes
And you do not hide your face because somebody said one time it wasn't natural
What a joy for us just running down this crooked trail of midnight
And the peaceful things inside me that it does
Then you whisper low I have to go the acid tears start coming slow
To complicate a simple thing as love

Awake now I don't hear the floorboards creaking as you walk back from the window
Or feel your satin fingers drawing patterns on my back where I lay dying
Without you I'm a child who sucks the vacant thumb of emptiness
Left crying when he has not had enough
At the mercy of an empty room sing verses to some faded wall
Confused about a simple thing as love

It's too bad we couldn't stay here till the clock runs out and falls from sheer exhaustion
Or till morning when I watch you as you stoop to pick your things up from the floor
But too soon for us it's over and the shock of the electric lightbulb
Sunrise from the ceiling up above
As it dangles to remind us of the spiderweb that binds us
And just complicates a simple thing as love

Awake now I don't hear the floorboards creaking as you walk back from the window
Or feel your satin fingers drawing patterns on my back where I lay dying
Without you I'm a child who sucks the vacant thumb of emptiness
Left crying when he has not had enough
At the mercy of an empty room sing verses to some faded wall
Confused about a simple thing as love"
Roy Clark,Then She’s a Lover,"She comes in about six o'clock
Tripping over toys
And picking up socks
And you think her day
Had been a ton of trouble

She's been doing important things
With trading stamps
And turnip greens
And have I noticed how
The price of soap has doubled

She's as normal as she can be
She never misses Jeopardy
And I think that she'd elope
With Dick Van Dyke

And when the kids have all been fed
And when I lay me down to bed
She gives me my time of the night

Then she's a lover
She comes to my side
Right around midnight
After her day's been so confused

That's why I love her
And that's why I do right
And if there's a reason
God gave me a feeling
Baby, it's you

She hates tangerines
She loves the ring
Volunteers me for everything
And the bank has never
Been right in her life

She thinks my Uncle Bill's a sap
She's taught me words like overdraft
The only numbers she remembers
Is her shoe size

She had words with the guy next door
And almost started a neighborhood war
Cause he said something smart
To our son, Bob

And therefore, I had to invite him in
To apologize and convince him
She really didn't think he was
A big, fat slob

She's as normal as she can be
She never misses Jeopardy
And I think that she'd elope
With Dick Van Dyke

But when the kids have all been fed
And when I lay me down to bed
She gives me my time of the night

Then she's a lover
She comes to my side
Right around midnight
After her day's been so confused

That's why I love her
And that's why I do right
And if there's a reason
God gave me a feeling
Baby, it's you

Then she's a lover
She comes to my side..."
Roy Clark,I’ll Paint You a Song,"I'm just a country boy as little I can offer you
Just rhymes and melodies are all I have to give
But I've made friends with lines and I may comfort you
If you just come with me I'll show you how to live

I'll sing you a morning with laughing bluebirds
I'll sing you a fairytale full of ribbons and crape paper words
I'll sing you a rainbow you can keep for your own
I'll sing you a morning I'll paint you a song

I look inside your eyes and find a little girl
Whose dreams have turned to sand somewhere along her way
But if you'll close your eyes and step inside my world
I'll take you by the hand and we'll find a brand new day

I'll sing you a mellow with marsh mellow shies
I'll sing you a puppy dog with a pink tongue and big loving eyes
I'll sing you a sunset that flows all night long
I'll sing you a meadow I'll paint you a song"
Roy Clark,The Tip of My Fingers,"I reached out my arms and I touched you
With soft words I whispered your name
I had your love on the tips of my fingers
Oh, but that was as close as I came

My eyes had a vision of sweet lips
Yielding beneath my command
I had your love on the tips of my fingers
But I let it slip right through my hands
But I let it slip right through my hands

Somebody took you when I wasn't looking
And I should have known from the start
That it's a long, long way from the tips of my fingers
To the love hidden deep in your heart
To the love hidden deep in your heart

I had your love on the tips of my fingers
But I let you slip right through my hands

Yes, I let you slip right through my hands..."
Roy Clark,Jesse James,"Jesse James was a man who rambled through the land
And he robbed many a bank and train
He was the leader man of a bold and reckless band
And many are the people that were slain

But, no more Jesse James; no more Jesse James
They laid poor Jesse in his grave
Jesse went and turned his head; Little Bobby shot him dead
And they laid poor Jesse in his grave

Now Jesse had a wife; who mourned all her life
Because of Jesse's evil ways
But she couldn't stay his hand; or stop the robber band
Her grief made her old and gray

But, no more Jesse James; no more Jesse James
They laid poor Jesse in his grave
Jesse went and turned his head; Little Bobby shot him dead
And they laid poor Jesse in his grave

But the end it came at last; from a bullet quick and fast
From a comrade he trusted in his band
And the deed they said was just; when they laid him in the dust
He had been such a terror in the land

But, no more Jesse James; no more Jesse James
They laid poor Jesse in his grave
Jesse went and turned his head; Little Bobby shot him dead
And they laid poor Jesse in his grave"
Roy Clark,Do You Believe This Town,"The woman next door has gone to the PTA
And stopped to see her best friend's husband on the way
The folks down the street have a different thing
So everyone is putting them down
Do you believe this town?

Deacon Jones preaches brotherly love every Sunday
And forecloses loans on widow's homes every Monday
But the smart guys say it's the only way
To keep the economy sound
Do you believe this town?

Do you believe they voted this town dry?
Well you won't believe it when I tell you why
The mayor and his cousin and the chief of police
Have the bootlegging all nailed down
Do you believe this town?

Do you believe they burned a house down yesterday
You won't believe the reason that they gave
If the folks who lived there had a known their place
They could still be hanging around
Do you believe this town?

Do you believe this town?"
Roy Clark,Over the Waves,
Roy Clark,September Song,"When I was a young man courtin' the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossin' curls
I let this old world take a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears instead of pearls
And as time came along she came my way
As time came along she came

But it's a long long time from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
And when the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
And one hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September and November
But these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September and November
But these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you..."
Roy Clark,The Last Letter,"Why do you treat me as if I were only a friend
What have I done that has made you so different and cold
Sometimes I wonder if you'll be contented again
Will you be happy when you are withered and old

I cannot offer you diamonds or mansions so fine
I cannot offer you all the clothes that your young body crave
But if you'll say that forever you will be mine
Just think of the heartaches all the tears and the sorrow you'll save

When you are weary and tired of another one's gold
When you are lonely remember this letter my own
Don't try to answer though I've suffered anguish untold
If you don't love me I wish you would leave me alone

As I am writing this letter I think of the past
And of the promises that you are breaking so free
But soon I'll bid my farewell to this old world and you at last
I will be gone when you read this last letter from me..."
Roy Clark,Twelfth Street Rag,
Roy Clark,Rocky Top,"I wish that I was on old Rocky Top
Down in the Tennessee hills
Ain't no smoggy smoke on Rocky Top
Ain't no telephone bills

Once I had a girl on Rocky Top
Half bear the other half cat
Wild as a mink but sweet as soda pop
I still dream about that

Rocky Top you'll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good old Rocky Top
Rocky Top Tennessee Rocky Top Tennessee

Once two strangers climbed old Rocky Top
Lookin' for a moonshine still
Strangers ain't come down from Rocky Top
Reckon they never will

Corn won't grow at all on Rocky Top
Dirt's too rocky by far
That's why all the folks on Rocky Top
Get their corn from a jar

I've had years of cramped up city life
Trapped like a duck in a pen
All I know is it's a pity life
Can't be simple again"
Roy Clark,"Live Fast, Love Hard, Die Young","(I wanna live fast, love hard, die young
And leave a beautiful memory)
I wanna live fast, love hard. die young
And leave a beautiful memory

Don't want slow walkin' or sad singin'
Let 'em have a jubilee
I wanna leave a lot of happy women
A thinking pretty thoughts of me
I wanna live fast. love hard, die young
And leave a beautiful memory

I got a brand new car and a brand new suit
And I know how to get around
I got a little black book and the gals look cute
And I know the name of every spot in town

I wanna find 'em, fool 'em, leave 'em
And let 'em do the same to me
I wanna live fast. love hard, die young
And leave a beautiful memory

I wanna live fast, love hard, die young
And leave a beautiful memory
I'm a wampus cat, let me grab my hat
And baby come along with me

We're gonna do some fancy stepping
We're really goin' on a spree
I wanna live fast, love hard, die young
And leave a beautiful memory

Now you may not approve of the things I do
But it really don't bother me
But don't ever think you can tie me down
I'm gonna stay footloose and fancy free

Jump back, make tracks, move out
And let the pretty gals at me
I wanna live fast, love hard, die young
And leave a beautiful memory..."
Roy Clark,Kansas City,"I'm going to Kansas City, Kansas City here I come
I'm going to Kansas City, Kansas City here I come
They got a crazy way of loving there
And I'm gonna get me some

I'll be standing on the corner
On the corner of Twelfth Street and Vine
I'm gonna be standing on the corner
On the corner of Twelfth Street and Vine
With my Kansas City baby
And a bottle of Kansas City wine

Well I might take a train
I might take a plane, but if I have to walk
I'm gonna get there just the same
I'm going to Kansas City, Kansas City here I come
They got a crazy way of loving there
And I'm gonna get me some

I'm gonna pack my clothes
Leave at the break of dawn
I'm gonna pack my clothes
Everybody will be sleeping
Nobody will know where I've gone
Cause if I stay in town
I know I'm gonna die
Gotta find a friendly city
And that's the reason why
I'm going to Kansas City
Kansas City here I come
They got a crazy way of loving there
And I'm gonna get me some"
Roy Clark,Me and Bobby McGee,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge headed for the trains
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained
Took us all the way to New Orleans

I took my ol' har'poon out of my dirty red bandana
And was blowin' sad while Bobby sang the blues
With the windshield whipers slappin' time
And Bobby clappin' hands we finally sang up ever song that driver knew

Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
Feeling good was easy Lord when Bobby sang the blues
Feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee

From the coal mines of Kentucky to the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Standing right beside me Lord through everything I done
And every night she kept me from the cold

Then somewhere near Salinas Lord I let her slip away
Looking for the home I hope she'll find
I'd trade all of my tomorrows for a single yesterday
Holding her body close to mine

Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
Feeling good was easy Lord when Bobby sang the blues
Feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee..."
Ernest Tubb,Thanks A Lot,"[Chorus]
Thanks
Thanks a lot
I got a broken heart
That's all I've got
You made me cry
Now I cried a lot
I lost your love
Baby thanks a lot

You told our friends
As I was passin' by
That you're not sorry
That you made me cry
You said I deserve
Just what I got
Well if that's how you feel
Honey thanks a lot
Thanks thanks a lot

[Chorus]

You wanted a fool
And I played the part
Now all I've got
Is a broken heart
We loved a little
And laughed a lot
Then you were gone
Honey thanks a lot

[Chorus]"
Ernest Tubb,Waltz Across Texas,"When we dance together my world's in disguise it's a fairyland tale that come true
And when you look at me with those stars in your eyes
I could waltz across Texas with you
Waltz across Texas with you in my arms waltz across Texas with you
Like a storybook ending I'm lost in your charms
And I could waltz across Texas with you

My heartaches and troubles are just up and gone the moment that you come in view
And with your hand in mine dear I could dance on and on
And I could waltz across Texas with you
Waltz across Texas..."
Ernest Tubb,Walking The Floor Over You,"[Verse 1]
You left me, and you went away
You said that you'd be back in just a day
You've broken your promise, and you've left me here alone
I don't know why you did, dear,  but I do know that you're gone

[Chorus]
I'm walking the floor over you
I can't sleep a wink, that is true
I'm hoping and I'm praying as my heart breaks right in two
Walking the floor over you

[Guitar Solo]
Aw, pick it out, Smitty!

[Chorus]
Now darling, you know I love you well
Love you more than I can ever tell
I thought that you wanted me and always would be mine
But you went and left me here with troubles on my mind

[Chorus]
I'm walking the floor over you
I can't sleep a wink, that is true
I'm hoping and I'm praying as my heart breaks right in two
Walking the floor over you

[Guitar Solo]
Aw, do it pretty, son!

[Verse 3]
Now someday you may be lonesome too
Walking the floor is good for you
Just keep right on walking, and it won't hurt you to cry
Remember that I love you and I will the day I die

[Chorus]
I'm walking the floor over you
I can't sleep a wink, that is true
I'm hoping and I'm praying as my heart breaks right in two
Walking the floor over you"
Ernest Tubb,Pass The Booze,"Been my friends all day
It's no good I'm still lonely
Seems that I just can't forget
My one and only
So there's just one thing left to do
If I intend to sleep tonight
Put the bottle on the bar
And let me do it up right

Please put the bottle on the bar
Where I can pet it
And take my address down
Before I forget it

I've got a feeling someone's
Gonna have to take me home this time
Cause I'm gonna sit here
Till I get her off of my mind

My baby's gone gone gone
And I'm alone so so alone
And I've got nothing else to lose
So bartender pass the booze

Please put the bottle on the bar
Where I can pet it
And take my address down
Before I forget it
I've got a feeling someone's
Gonna have to take me home this time
Cause I'm gonna sit here
Till I get her off of my mind

My baby's gone gone gone
And I'm alone so so alone
And I've got nothing else to lose
So bartender pass the booze"
Ernest Tubb,Drivin’ Nails In My Coffin,"My sweetheart has gone and I'm so lonely she said that she and I were through
So I started out drinking for past time drivin' nails in my coffin over you
I'm just drivin' nails in my coffin everytime I drink a bottle of booze
I'm just drivin' nails in my coffin Lord I'm drivin' those nails over you

Now ever since the day that we've parted I've been so sad and so blue
I'm always thinking of you love and I just can't quit drinking that old booze
I'm just drivin' nails in my coffin...

Now you've turned me down you don't want me there's nothing now I can lose
I'm just drivin' those nails in my coffin and worryin' my darlin' over you
I'm just drivin' nails in my coffin..."
Ernest Tubb,Soldier’s Last Letter,"When the postman delivered the letter
Well, it filled her old heart full of joy
But she didn't know 'til she read the inside
It was the last one from her darling boy
""Dear Mom,"" was the way that it started
""I miss you so much,"" it went on
""And, Mom, I didn't know that I loved you so
But I'll prove it when this war is won""
""I'm writing this down in a trench, Mom
So don't scold if it isn't so neat
For you know as you did, when I was a kid
And would come home with mud on my feet""
""Well, the captain just gave us our orders
And mom we will carry them through
I'll finish this letter the first chance I get
But for now I'll just say I love you""
Then the mother's old hands began to tremble
As she fought against tears in her eyes
For they came unashamed, there was no name
And she knew that her darlin' had died
That night as she knelt by her bedside
She prayed, ""Lord above, hear my plea
Protect all the sons that are fighting tonight
And dear God keep America free""..."
Ernest Tubb,"Saturday Satan, Sunday Saint","Saturday Satan, Sunday saint
Foolin' your neighbors
That's what you think
Readin' the good book
Singin' the hymns
Come Monday morning and it's back to a life of sin

Old brother Brown
All week he steals
Tells everyone
His big business deals
The deacon walks by
A dollar hits the plate
Tryin' to buy himself a ticket to the pearly gates

Old sister Rose
On the very first row
Been a-sittin' right there
Twenty years or so
Never hears a word
When the preacher speaks
Too busy talkin' bout the bad girl down the street

Saturday Satan, Sunday saint
Foolin' your neighbors
Readin' the good book
Singin' the hymns
Come Monday mornin' and it's back to a life of sin

This little song holds good advice
Though some people may
Think it ain't too nice
Well, if you're one
Who's wearing the shoes
Well, there's somebody watchin' and he ain't nobody's fool

Saturday Satan, Sunday saint
Foolin' your neighbors
Readin' the good book
Singin' the hymns
Come Monday mornin' and it's back to a life of sin
Come Monday mornin' and it's back to a life of sin"
Ernest Tubb,May The Bird Of Paradise Fly Up Your Nose,"One fine day as I was walking down the street
I spied a beggar man with rags upon his feet
Took a penny from my pocket in his tin cup I did drop it
And I heard him say as I made my retreat

May the bird of paradise fly up your nose
May an elephant caress you with it's toes
May your wife be plagued with runners in her hose
May the bird of paradise fly up your nose

My laundry man is really on his toes
Found a hundred dollar bill among my clothes
When he called me I came running
Gave him back his dime for phoning
And I heard him saying as I turned to go

May the bird of paradise fly up your nose
May an elephant caress you with it's toes
May your wife be plagued with runners in her hose
May the bird of paradise fly up your nose

I was way behind one day to catch a train
The taxi driver said we'll make it just the same
A speed cop made it with us and as he wrote out the ticket
I stood by politely waitin' for my change

May the bird of paradise fly up your nose
May an elephant caress you with it's toes
May your wife be plagued with runners in her hose
May the bird of paradise fly up your nose"
Ernest Tubb,Missing In Action,"The warship had landed and night come ashore
The fighting was over for me ever more
For I had been wounded they left me forget
A stone for my pillow and snow for my bed
The enemy found me and took me away and made me a prisoner of war so they say
But God in his mercy was with me one day the gate was left open and I ran away
I returned to the old home my sweet wife to see
The home I had built for my darling and me
The door I then opened and there on the stand I saw a picture of her and the man
The clothes she was wearing told me the sad tale
My darling was wearing a new bridal veil
Then I found a letter and these words I read missing in action she thought I was dead

So I kissed her picture and whispered goodbye
My poor heart was breaking but my eyes were dry
I knew it was too late for her now to learn
I knew she must never know I had returned
A vagabond dreamer forever I'll roam
Because there was no one to welcome me home
The face of my darling no more I shall see for missing in action forever I'll be"
Ernest Tubb,Filipino Baby,"When the warship's left Manila sailing proudly o'er the sea
All the sailors hearts were filled with fond regret
Looking backward to this Island where they spent such happy hours
Making love to every pretty girl they've met
(Well up stopped a little sailor with his pride eyes all aglow
Saying take a look at my girl's photograph)
Then the sailors gathered round him just to look upon her face
And he said I love my Filipino baby

She's my Filipino baby she's my trasure and my pet
Her teeth are bright and pearly and her hair is black as jet
Oh her lips are sweet as honey and her heart is true I know
She's my darling my little Filipino baby

In a little rustic cottage in the port of Filipines dwells a lonely little maiden all alone
(She is thinking of her true love though he's far across the sea
And her heart beats true for him and him alone)
Then one day he whispered darling I've come back from Caroline
I've come back to claim the only girl I love
And that night there was a wedding while the ships crew gathered round
And he wed his little Filipino baby

She's my Filipino baby she's my trasure and my pet
Her teeth are bright and pearly and her hair is black as jet
Oh her lips are sweet as honey and her heart is true I know
She's my darling my little Filipino baby"
Ernest Tubb,Another Story,"[Verse 1]
No regrets no hard feelings it's over
All the good times together are through
I'll have a lifetime of memories to keep me going
I wouldn't take back one moment spent with you

[Verse 2]
I can't say that your leaving won't hurt me
But it's nothing that time can't erase
And someday this hurting will be over
Another story another time another place

[Verse 3]
Then one day I'll be sitting with another
And suddenly a smile will cross my face
If she asks me what's so funny then I'll tell her
Another story another time another place

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
So no regrets no hard feelings it's over
Yes it hurts me 'cause I lost out in the race
But someday this hurtin's gonna leave me
Another story another time another place

Then one day I'll be sitting with another
And suddenly a smile will cross my face
If she asks me what's so funny then I'll tell her
Another story another time another place"
Ernest Tubb,I Hung My Head And Cried,"You told me that you cared that you would never lie
I saw you in another's arms and I hung my head and I cried
Hung down my head and cried hung down my head and I cried
I saw you in another's arms and I hung my head and I cried

I prayed to God above to give me wings to fly
To fly away to another world and I hung my head and I cried
Hung down my head and cried..."
Ernest Tubb,You Nearly Lose Your Mind,"Well if you love your mama and you treat her right
But she keeps on fussin' at you every day and night
And she's triflin' on ye they'll do it every time
And when your baby starts to steppin' Lord you nearly lose your mind
Now if your mama's mean take a tip from me
Lock her up at home Lord and hang on to the key
Cause she won't triflin' on ye they'll do it every time
And when your baby starts to steppin' Lord you nearly lose your mind
But if your mama's good I'll tell you what to do
Give her lots of lovin' and what she wants to do
She'll trifle on ye they'll do it every time
And when your baby starts to steppin' Lord you nearly lose your mind

Now you come home to your mama find your clothes ain't clean
You can bet you're slippin' if you know just what I mean
Cause she's been triflin' on ye they'll do it every time
And when your baby starts to steppin' Lord you nearly lose your mind
Now you may have a mama who says that she is true
But wait till you get down and out and really leave her too
She'll trifle on ye they'll do it every time
And when your baby starts to steppin' Lord you nearly lose your mind
Now I've been lotta places not much I ain't done
But when it comes to women I just don't trust a one
Because they'll trifle on ye they'll do it every time
And when your baby starts to steppin' Lord you nearly lose your mind
(Really drive you crazy)"
Ernest Tubb,Rainbow At Midnight,"After the war was over
I was coming home to you
I saw a rainbow at midnight
Out on the ocean blue

The stars in heaven were shining
The moon gave its light from above
I saw your face in this rainbow
And it made me think of our love

We'll build our home in the country
And make all our dreams come true
There we will make a heaven
Sweetheart just for we two

Here we will live so happy
And have a baby or two
We'll name them after the rainbow
Because it reminds me of you

After this life is over
And our journey here is through
We'll move to the land of the rainbow
And live in the starry blue"
Ernest Tubb,Blue Christmas,"I'll have a blue Christmas without you I'll be so blue thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Won't mean a thing dear if you're not here with me
I'll have a blue Christmas that's certain
And when that blue heartache starts hurtin'
You'll be doing all right with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue blue Christmas

I'll have a blue Christmas I know dear
I hope your white Christmas brings you cheer
And when you say your prayers on this Christmas Eve
Will you feel the same dear as when you prayed with me
And when those blue snowflakes start falling
That's when those blue mem'ries start calling
You'll be doing all right with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue blue Christmas"
Ernest Tubb,Our Baby’s Book,"There's a new star in heaven tonight
The brightest of them all up there
As we gaze at the sky
We wonder why
That the Lord took our baby so fair

For he was as sweet as the rose
His eyes was so big bright and blue
And it made me so glad they said he favors his dad
And my wife said: ""He's the image of you""

Now you should see our baby's book
It's pink and bordered with gold
Though it's not complete
But on the first sheet
Our darling's life story is told

It tells of the days that he came
To add more joy to our home
After seven short weeks
Our Master did speak
And now Rodger Dale has gone

But I know that he's happy up there
I can vision each action and look
Friends, as you travel on
Please remember this song
For it's written in our baby's book"
Ernest Tubb,Driftwood On The River,"I'm just driftwood on the river floating down the tide
I don't care where this old river carries me
I keep drifting just because my heart is broken inside
And I'm tired of wishing for what cannot be
I may meet some little driftwood lost as same as I
Share a handshake and a tender tear or two
But it's always good luck how we got to say goodbye
I must wander on to keep my rendezvous

Though I drift through town and city, I can never stay
For I find no place to call my home sweet home
I don't ask for help or pity, I just go my way
All I'm praying for is peace to dream alone
Oh, do it pretty, Butterball

I'm just driftwood on the river and I'm drifting on
'Til this weary river meets the deep blue sea
Where the deep blue sea may help me to forget someone
Yes, the careless one who has forgotten me
In my heart, I don't feel bitter over what has been
I feel sorry for the one I must forget
And instead of being someone with the world to win
I'm just driftwood on the river of regret"
Ernest Tubb,Let’s Say Goodbye Like We Said Hello,"Let's say goodbye like we said hello in a friendly kind of way
There's something wrong your love is gone I've no reason now to stay
We live and love we meet and part and broken hearts must pay
Let's say goodbye like we said hello in a friendly kind of way
Your love sweetheart I won't forget you're always on my mind
You're all the happiness I knew so thoughtful sweet and kind
For old time sake I'm asking you to think of me some day
Let's say goodbye like we said hello in a friendly kind of way

(I wish you happiness sweetheart in everything you do
May good luck always come your way and every dream come true)
I remember you and the love we knew the love of yesterday
Let's say goodbye like we said hello in a friendly kind of way
If I should meet some other dear and learn to love them too
I hope and pray somehow sweetheart they'll make me think of you
A tender smile an old love song a heart so light and gay
Let's say goodbye like we said hello in a friendly kind of way"
Ernest Tubb,Just A Drink Away,"See that girl at the bar she just took my house and car
And the little ones that meant to world to me
She gets wilder day by day now she's just a drink away
Just a drink away from anyone but me
So step up to the bar makes no difference who you are
You'll be welcomed just as long as she can see
That she's tearing out my heart like she planned from the start
She's just a drink away from anyone but me

I tried so hard to leave this town but it seems I'm tied and bound
To a love that somehow just won't set me free
And I miss my baby so and I pray they'll never know
She's just a drink away from anyone but me
If the judge could only see what she does to punish me
I wonder how he'd feel about her now
Would he still think that she's right If he could see her here each night
Just a drink away from anyone but me
She's just a drink away from anyone but me"
Ernest Tubb,It’s A Lonely World,"It's a lonely world when you're all alone
When there's no one to share every sorrow and care
When there's no one to greet you at the close of the day
The sunshine may come in your heart and never comes to stay
It's a lonely world when you're all alone
And that's the way my world is since you're gone

[ guitar ]
There's no way to count the tears I have shed
And nights I've been blue dear just thinking of you
Everyone has told me darling I should forget
But you're still here in my heart and you know I love you yet
It's a lonely world when you're all alone
And that's the way my world is since you're gone

[ guitar ]
It's a lonely world..."
Ernest Tubb,Thoughts Of A Fool,"I had a love and it was all mine
I drove her out, I must've been blind
That's the thoughts of a fool thinking out loud

She loved me so, but I was untrue
She's gone for good, what can I do
That's the thoughts of a fool thinking out loud

There's not a thing that I can say about her
Except I don't know how I'm going to live without her
I had a love and it was all mine

I watched it fade a kiss at a time
That's the thoughts of a fool thinking out loud
That's the thoughts of a fool thinking out loud"
Ernest Tubb,I Know My Baby Loves Me In Her Own Peculiar Way,"Now I got a gal just different and though I know she's true
She's never really happy that gal she's feelin' blue
But I know my baby loves me in her own peculiar way
Yes my baby really loves me in her own peculiar way
Now I left her my apartment when I was out of town
When I got back I found that she had to burn the building down
But I know my baby loves me in her own peculiar way
Yes my baby really loves me in her own peculiar way

Now she took occurs and cooking and filled my heart with glee
Till I detected poison in the cake she baked for me
But I know my baby loves me in her own peculiar way
Yes my baby really loves me in her own peculiar way
Now she went down to the corner to catch a picture show
She said I'll see you later but that was twenty years ago
But I know my baby loves me in her own peculiar way
Yes my baby really loves me in her own peculiar way"
Ernest Tubb,Half A Mind,"I don't love you like I used to do but I'm afraid to tell you so
I've got half a mind to leave you but only half the heart to go
Words to tell you just don't come to me guess my courage is too slow
I've got half a mind to leave you but only half the heart to go

Now time may prove that you're not to blame but now's the time I need to know
I've got half a mind to leave you but only half the heart to go"
Ernest Tubb,That’s All She Wrote,"I got a letter from my mama just a line or two
She said listen daddy your good girl's leavin' you
That's all she wrote didn't write no more
She'd left the gloom a hanging round my front door

Now I woke up this morning a quarter past three
I just couldn't realize this could happen to me
That's all she wrote...

Now listen pretty mama you know you done me wrong
Didn't even give a warning till after you were gone
That's all you wrote...

Now someday you'll be sorry your heart will ache with pain
You'd give a million dollars to write that note again
That's all you wrote...

Now listen all you ramblers who think your girl is true
Don't ever be too certain or you'll be singing too
That's all she wrote...

I'll always love you honey although you done me wrong
But when you ask forgiveness I'll just say travel on
That's all I'll write won't write no more
The gloom will then be hanging round your front door"
Ernest Tubb,Mean Mama Blues,"There's lots of mean women on almost any street
Lord There's lots of mean women on almost any street
But I've got the meanest Mama that ever walked on two feet

That gal is so low down I often wonder why
Lord she's so low down I often wonder why
That she keeps on livin' I guess she's to mean to die

Now you triflin' women always say you love your man
Lord you triflin' women always say you love your man
And when he goes out the front door the back door lets a new man in
(Ah maybe two of them)

Now there's two things in this world I don't understand
Lord there's two things in this world that I don't understand
One of thems a woman the other ones a man

I'm gonna buy me a pistol I'll think I'll get a 44
Gonna buy me a pistol I'll think I'll get a 44
And when I get through shootin' that girl won't step no more"
Faith Hill,Breathe,"[Verse 1]
I can feel the magic floating in the air
Being with you gets me that way
I watch the sunlight dance across your face, and I've
Never been this swept away

[Verse 2]
All my thoughts just seem to settle on the breeze
When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms
The whole world just fades away
The only thing I hear
Is the beating of your heart

[Chorus]
'Cause I can feel you breathe, it's washing over me
And suddenly, I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby, all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch, slow and steady rush
And baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be?
I can feel you breathe
Just breathe

[Verse 3]
In a way, I know my heart is waking up
As all the walls come tumbling down
Closer than I've ever felt before
And I know, and you know
There's no need for words right now

[Chorus]
'Cause I can feel you breathe, washing over me
And suddenly, I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby, all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch, slow and steady rush
And baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be?
I can feel you breathe
Just breathe

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Caught up in the touch, slow and steady rush
And baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be?
I can feel you breathe
Just breathe

I can feel the magic floating in the air
Being with you gets me that way"
Faith Hill,"Where Are You, Christmas?","[Verse]
Where are you, Christmas?
Why can't I find you?
Why have you gone away?
Where is the laughter?
You used to bring me
Why can't I hear music play?
My world is changing
I'm rearranging
Does that mean Christmas changes too?
Where are you Christmas?
Do you remember
The one you used to know?
I'm not the same one
See what the time's done
Is that why you have let me go?
Christmas is here
Everywhere, oh
Christmas is here
If you care, oh
If there is love in your heart and your mind
You will feel like Christmas all the time

I feel you Christmas
I know I've found you

The joy of Christmas
Stays here inside us
Fills each and every heart with love

Maybe I could cope, maybe I'd get some sleep
If I had just one moment at your expense
Maybe all my misery would be well spent, yeah

Could you cry a little?
Lie just a little
Pretend that you're feeling a little more pain
I gave, now I'm wanting
Something in return
So cry just a little for me

If your love could be caged
Honey, I would hold the key
And conceal it underneath
The pile of lies you handed me
And you'd hunt those lies
They'd be all you'd ever find
And that'd be all you'd have to know
For me to be fine, yeah

Can you cry a little?
Die just a little
And baby, I would feel just a little less pain
I gave, now I'm wanting
Something in return
So cry just a little for me

Nothing's gonna save me
I can see it in your eyes
Some kind of heartache
Honey, give it a try
I don't want pity

Lie just a little
Pretend that you're feeling a little more pain

Faith Hill,Wild One,"[Verse 1]
They said change your clothes, she said, ""No, I won't""
They said comb your hair, she said some kids don't
And her parents dreams went up in smoke
They said you can't leave, she said, ""Yes, I will""
They said don't see him, she said his name is Bill
She's on a roll and it's all uphill

[Chorus]
She's a wild one with an angel's face
She's a woman-child in a state of grace
When she was three years old on her daddy's knee
He said, ""You can be anything you wanna be""
She's a wild one running free

[Verse 2]
She loves rock and roll, they said it's Satan's tongue
She thinks they're too old, they think she's too young
The battle lines are clearly drawn

She's a woman-child in a state of grace
When she was three years old on her daddy's knee

Faith Hill,It Matters to Me,"[Verse 1]
Baby, tell me where'd you ever learn
To fight without saying a word
Then waltz back into my life
Like it's all gonna be alright
Don't you know how much it hurts?

[Chorus]
When we don't talk, when we don't touch
When it doesn't feel like we're even in love
It matters to me
When I don't know what to say, don't know what to do
Don't know if it really even matters to you
How can I make you see?
It matters to me

[Verse 2]
Maybe I still don't understand
The distance between a woman and a man
So tell me how far it is
And how you can love like this
'Cause I'm not sure I can

[Chorus]
When we don't talk, when we don't touch
When it doesn't feel like we're even in love
It matters to me
When I don't know what to say, don't know what to do

How can I make you see?
It matters to me

You
Never looked so good
As you did last night
Underneath the city lights
There
Walking with your friend
Laughin' at the moon
I swear you looked right through me

[Pre-Chorus: Faith Hill]
But I'm still livin' with your goodbye
And you're just goin' on with your life

[Chorus: Faith Hill, Both]
How can you just walk on by
Without one tear in your eye?
Don't you have the slightest feelings left for me?
Maybe that's just your way
Of dealing with the pain
Forgetting everything between our rise and fall
Like we never loved at all

[Verse 2: Faith Hill, Tim McGraw, & Both]
You
I hear you're doin' fine
Seems like you're doin' well
As far as I can tell
Time (Time)
Is leaving us behind (Leavin' us behind)
Another week has passed
And still I haven't laughed yet

[Pre-Chorus: Faith Hill, Tim McGraw, & Both]
So, tell me, what your secret is, baby, yeah
(I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know)
To letting go, letting go like you did, like you did

How can you just walk on by
Without one tear in your eye?
Don't you have the slightest feelings left for me?

You cannot break
Break another little piece of my heart now, baby"
Faith Hill,A Baby Changes Everything,"Teenage girl, much too young
Unprepared for what's to come
A baby changes everything

Not a ring on her hand
All her dreams and all her plans
A baby changes everything
A baby changes everything

The man she loves, she's never touched
How will she keep his trust?
A baby changes everything
A baby changes everything

And she cries
Ooh, she cries

She has to leave, go far away
Heaven knows she can't stay
A baby changes everything

She can feel it's coming soon
There's no place, there's no room
A baby changes everything
A baby changes everything

And she cries
And she cries
Ooh she cries

Shepherds all gather around
Up above a star shines down

Choir of angels say
Glory to the newborn king
A baby changes everything
A baby changes everything
Everything, everything, everything
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

My whole life has turned around
I was lost but now I'm found
A baby changes everything
A baby changes everything"
Faith Hill,The Secret of Life,"[Verse 1]
Couple of guys, sitting around drinking
Down at the Starlight Bar
One of 'em says, ""You know I've been thinking""
Other one says, ""That won't get you too far""
He says, ""This is your life, and welcome to it
It's just working and drinking and dreams
Ad on TV says ""Just Do It""
Hell if I know what that means""

[Chorus]
The secret of life is a good cup of coffee
The secret of life is keep your eye on the ball
The secret of life is a beautiful woman
And Marilyn stares down from the barroom wall

[Verse 2]
""You and me, we're just a couple of zeros
Just a couple of down-and-outs
But movie stars and football heroes
What have they got to be unhappy about?""
So they turn to the bartender, ""Sam, what do you think?
What's the key that unlocks that door?""
Sam don't say nothing, just wipes off the bar
And he pours them a couple more

[Chorus]
'Cause the secret of life is in Sam's martinis
The secret of life is in Marilyn's eyes
The secret of life is in Monday Night Football
Rolling Stones records and Mom's apple pie

[Verse 3]
Sam looks up from his Sunday paper
Says, ""Boys, you're on the wrong track
The secret of life is there ain't no secret
And you don't get your money back""
Hey

[Chorus]
The secret of life is getting up early
The secret of life is staying up late
The secret of life is try not to hurry
But don't wait
Don't wait

The secret of life is a good cup of coffee
The secret of life is keep your eye on the ball
The secret of life is to find the right woman
The secret of life is nothing at all
Oh, it's nothing at all
The secret of life

Couple of guys, sitting around drinking
Down at the Starlight Bar
One of them says, ""You know I've been thinking""
Other one says, ""That won't get you too far""

To the big stage I'm singin' on tonight
And sometimes the butterflies still get me
When I'm in the spotlight

I'd climb right up to the sky
I'd take down the stars
Just to be in your arms, baby
I'd go and capture the moon
That's what I would do
Just to hear you say that you love me
Just to hear you say that you love me

[Bridge: Faith Hill & (Tim McGraw)]
For the rest of your life
(For the rest of your life)
Love me for the rest of all time
Oh baby, baby
Just say the word
And I'll give you my world
There's nothing I won't do
Baby, just to be with you

[Chorus: Faith Hill & Tim McGraw]
I'd climb right up to the sky
I'd take down the stars
Just to be in your arms, baby
I'd go and capture the moon
That's what I would do
Just to hear you say that you love me

[Outro: Faith Hill & Tim McGraw]
Just to hear you say that you love me, baby
Just to hear you say that you love me
Oh, I need to hear you say that you love me, baby
Just to hear you say that you love me
Just say you love me
Just say you need me
Just to hear you say that you love me"
Faith Hill,I Love You,"[Verse 1]
I must be crazy now
Maybe I dream too much
But when i think of you
I long to feel your touch
To whisper in your ear
Words that are old as time
Words only you would hear
If only you were mine
I wish i could go back to the very first day i saw you
Should've made my move when you looked in my eyes
'Cause by now I know that you'd feel the way that I do
And you'd whisper these words as you'd lie here by my side

[Chorus]
I love you
Please say you love me too
These three words
They could change our lives forever
And I promise you that we will always be together
Till the end of time

[Verse 2]
So today I finally find the courage deep inside
Just to walk right up to your door
But my body can't move when i finally get to it
Like a thousand times before
Then without a word, you handed me this letter
Read ""I hope this finds the way into your heart"", it said

[Chorus]
""I love you
Please say you love me too
Till the end of time""

[Bridge]
Well maybe I, I need a little love, yeah
Maybe I, I need a little care
Maybe you, maybe you need somebody just to hold you
If you do
Just reach out
I'll be there

[Chorus]
I love you
Please say you love me
Please say you love me too
These three words, they could change our lives forever
And i promise you that we will always be together

[Outro]
Oh, I love you
Please say you love me
Please say you love me too
Till the end of time
Oh baby, my baby, together, forever
I love you
I will be your light
Shining through your eyes"
Faith Hill,When the Lights Go Down,"[Verse 1]
When the lights go down
He'll be filling a pan with a broom in his hand
In some dive across town
He'll be wiping the bar, and mopping the floor
Counting his tips, and locking the doors
Wrestling the Devil that tells him to pour another round

When the lights go down
She'll be calling her friends from her Mercedes Benz
But it's too late now
They were there for the fame, the flash, and the thrill
For the drop of the name, the parties, the pills
As another star falls from the Hollywood Hills without a sound

[Chorus]
When the lights go down
And there's nothing left to be
When the lights go down
And the truth is all you see
When you feel that hole inside your soul
And wonder what you're made of
Well, we all find out
When the lights go down

[Verse 2]
When the lights go down
At the end of the day when this game that I play
Has gone another round
As I lay there alone on this big empty bed
With nothing but thoughts of you in my head
I think of the things that I wish I had said
When you were still around

[Chorus]
When the lights go down and there's nothing left to be
When the lights go down and the truth is all you see
And I wonder if all my life's about
The sum of all my fears and all my doubts
When the lights go down

When the lights go down and there's nothing left to be
When the lights go down and the truth is all you see
When you feel that hole inside your soul
And wonder what you're made of
Well, we all find out
When the lights go down
Oh, when the lights go down"
Faith Hill,Let Me Let Go,"[Verse 1]
I thought it was over, baby
We said our goodbyes
But I can't go a day without your face
Going through my mind
In fact, not a single minute
Passes without you in it
Your voice, your touch, memories of your love
Are with me all of the time

[Chorus]
Let me let go, baby
Let me let go
If this is for the best, why are you still in my heart?
Are you still in my soul?
Let me let go

[Verse 2]
I talked to you the other day
Looks like you make your escape
You put us behind, no matter how hard I try
I can't do the same

[Chorus]
Let me let go, baby
Let me let go
It just isn't right
I've been two thousand miles
Down a dead-end road

[Chorus]
Let me let go, darling, won't you?
I just gotta know, yeah
If this is for the best
Why are you still in my heart?
Are you still in my soul?
Let me let go

[Bridge]
The lights of this strange city are shining
But they don't hold no fascination for me
I try to find the bright side, baby
But everywhere I look, everywhere I turn
You're all I see

[Chorus]
Let me, let me let go, baby, won't you?
Let me let go
It just isn't right
I've been two thousand miles
Down a dead-end road

[Outro]
Oh, let me let go, darling, won't you?
I just gotta know
If this is for the best
Why are you still in my heart?
Yeah, you're still in my soul
Let me let go
Let me let go
Let me let go"
Faith Hill,If I’m Not In Love,"If I'm not in love with you
What is this I'm going through?
Tonight
And if my heart is lying then
What should I believe in?
Why do I go crazy?
Every time I think about you, baby
Why else do I want you like I do?
If I'm not in love with you

And if I don't need your touch
Why do I miss you so much?
Tonight
If it's just infatuation then
Why is my heart aching?
To hold you forever
Give a part of me I thought I'd never
Give again to someone I could lose
If I'm not in love with you

Oh, why in every fantasy
Do I feel your arms embracing me?
Lovers lost in sweet desire
Oh, why in dreams do I surrender
Lying with you baby?
Someone help explain this feeling
Someone tell me

If I'm not in love with you
What is this I'm going through?
Tonight
And if my heart is lying then
What should I believe in?
Why do I go crazy?
Every time I think about you, baby
Why else do I want you like I do?
If I'm not in love with... you
Oh"
Faith Hill,If I Should Fall Behind,"[Verse 1]
We said we'd walk together
Baby, come what may
Back from the twilight
Should we lose our way
As we were walking
A hand should slip free
I'll wait for you
Should I fall behind
Wait for me

[Verse 2]
Swore we'd travel together
Darling, side by side
We'd help each other
Stay in stride
Each lover steps on
So differently
So I'll wait for you
Should I fall behind
Wait for me

[Verse 3]
Everyone dreams of
A love lasting and true
You and I know what this world can do
So let's make ourselves be
That the other may see
And I'll wait for you
And should I fall behind
Wait for me

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 4]
There's a beautiful river
In the valley ahead
There beneath the oak's bough
Soon we will wed
Should we lose each other
In the shadow of the evening trees
Oh, I'll wait for you
Should I fall behind
Wait for me
Darling, I'll wait for you
And should I fall behind
Wait for me

[Outro]
Wait for me
If I should fall behind
Wait for me
Wait for me"
Faith Hill,Let’s Go to Vegas,"[Chorus]
Hey baby, let's go to Vegas
Kiss the single life good-bye
Hey baby, let's go to Vegas

Lying on the bank of the river
Stars are dancin

Holding you is what i live for
I just had a crazy thought

A pair of rings and a preacher too
Underneath the neon steeple
We'll take a gamble and say ""I do""

Hey baby, let's go to Vegas

Faith Hill,You Can’t Lose Me,"[Verse 1]
A little girl, a little small for her age
A little too slow for the field day race
Momma's waiting at the finish line
And wipes the teardrops from her eyes
She says, ""You did just fine honey, that's okay
Sometimes life's just that way
You're gonna lose the race from time to time
But you're always gonna find

[Chorus]
""You can't lose me
Bet your life
I am here and I will always be
Just a wish away
Wherever you go
No matter how far
My love is where you are
You won't be lost if you believe
You can't lose me""

[Verse 2]
Momma used to say ""Girl it won't be long
Till it's time to go out on your own
Chase your dreams find your place in life
I know you'll do just fine""
When that day finally came
There were things she needed to but could not say
So I whispered softly as I wiped the tears from momma's eyes

[Chorus]
""You can't lose me
Bet your life
I am here and I will always be
Just a wish away
Wherever you go
No matter how far
My love is where you are
You won't be lost if you believe
You can't lose me""
Wherever you go
Hey, no matter how far
My love is where you are
You won't be lost if you believe
No, you can't lose me""
Hey, hey, you can't lose me""
Wherever you go
Hey, no matter how far
My love is where you are
You can't lose me"""
Faith Hill,Wish For You,"[Verse 1]
A setting sun that paints a tie-dyed sky
A feather bed, an ancient lullaby
A kiss good night from one whose love is true

[Hook]
That's the kind of day I wish for you

[Verse 2]
A field of flowers dancing in the spring
A little creek, a tree, an old rope swing
Cotton candy clouds against the blue
That's the kind of day I wish for you
First love with all its storm
Raging like fire within
Tossing your heart to chance
You swear the dance will never end

[Verse 3]
But then it does and someone says goodbye
And after all those empty nights you cried
The morning that you wake up good as new

[Hook]
That's the kind of day I wish for you

[Verse 3]
The faith of knowing deep inside your heart
That heaven holds more than just some stars
Someone's up there watching over you

[Hook]
That's the kind of day I wish for you"
Faith Hill,American Heart,"[Verse 1]
She's up before the sun, on the run
Another dollar, another day, another cup of coffee
Thank you Lord for giving me one more
She still leans on her dreams but it seems
Sometimes she's the only one who still believes
That life is hard, so she takes it on with an American heart.

[Chorus]
And it beats like a drum down in New Orleans.
Sings like a Motown melody
It dreams like California
Bigger than the Texas sky
It bleeds, it scars
But it shines when times get hard
And you can't break an American heart

[Verse 2]
From the small town Friday night lights
To the Broadway neon burning up bright
We're all the same and it's in our veins
A spirit that you can't keep down
A fire inside that'll never burn out
If you are the owner of an American Heart

[Chorus]
'Cause it beats like a drum down in New Orleans
Sings like a Motown melody
It dreams like California
Bigger than the Texas sky
It bleeds, it scars
But it shines when times get hard
And you can't break an American heart

[Chorus]
And it beats like a drum down in New Orleans
Sings like a Motown melody
It beats like a drum down in New Orleans
Sings like a Motown melody
It dreams like California
Bigger than the Texas sky
It bleeds, it scars
But it shines when times get hard
And you can't break
You can't break an American heart
An American heart
An American heart

[Outro]
God Bless America
Land of the free
God Bless America"

Patty Loveless,You’ll Never Leave Harlan Alive,"[Verse 1]
In the deep dark hills of eastern Kentucky
That's the place where I traced my bloodline
And it's there I read on a hillside gravestone
""You'll never leave Harlan alive""

[Verse 2]
Oh my grandfather's dad crossed the Cumberland Mountains
Where he took a pretty girl to be his bride
Said, ""Won't you walk with me, out of the mouth of this holler
Or we'll never leave Harlan alive""

[Chorus 1]
Where the sun comes up about ten in the morning
And the sun goes down about three in the day
And you fill your cup with whatever bitter brew you're drinkin'
And you spend your life just thinkin' of how to get away

[Verse 3]
No one ever knew there was coal in them mountains
'Til a man from the northeast arrived
Waving hundred dollar bills, said, ""I'll pay for your minerals""
But he never left Harlan alive

[Verse 4]
Grandma sold out cheap and they moved out west of Pineville
To a farm where Big Richland River winds
And I bet they danced them a jig
And they laughed and sang a new song
""Who said we'd never leave Harlan alive""

[Verse 5]
But the times they got hard and tobacco wasn't selling
And old granddad knew what he'd do to survive
He went and dug for Harlan coal
And sent the money back to grandma
But he never left Harlan alive

[Chorus 2]
Where the sun comes up about ten in the morning
And the sun goes down about three in the day
And you fill your cup with whatever bitter brew you're drinkin'
And you spend your life digging coal
From the bottom of your grave

[Tag]
You'll never leave Harlan alive"
Patty Loveless,Blame It On Your Heart,"You've got a thing or two to learn about me baby
'Cause I ain't taking it no more and I don't mean maybe
You don't know right from wrong
Well the love we had is gone
So blame it on your lying, cheating, cold deadbeating
Two-timing, double dealing
Mean mistreating, loving heart

Well all I wanted was to be your one and only
And all I ever got from you was being lonely
Now that dream is laid to rest
'Cause you have failed the test
Hey blame it on your lying, cheating, cold deadbeating
Two-timing, double dealing

Are you headed for a heartache, oh yeah
Gonna get a bad break, oh yeah
You made a bad mistake, oh yeah

Someone's gonna do you like you done me honey
And when she does you like she'll do, you'll see it ain't funny
You need some sympathy
But don't be calling me
Hey blame it on your lying, cheating, cold deadbeating

Patty Loveless,How Can I Help You Say Goodbye,"[Verse 1]
Through the back window of our '59 wagon
I watched my best friend Jamie slipping further away
I kept on waving till I couldn't see her
And through my tears I asked again why we couldn't stay

[Bridge]
Mama whispered softly time will ease your pain
Life's about changing nothing ever stays the same

[Chorus]
And she said how can I help you to say goodbye?
It's okay to hurt and it's okay to cry
Come let me hold you and I will try
How can I help you to say goodbye?

I sat on our bed he packed his suitcase
I held a picture of our wedding day
His hands were trembling we both were crying
He kissed me gently and then he quickly walked away

[Bridge]
I called up mama and she said time will ease your pain
Life's about changing nothing ever stays the same

[Chorus]
And she said how can I help you to say goodbye?
It's okay to hurt and it's okay to cry
Come let me hold you and I will try
How can I help you to say goodbye?

Sitting with mama alone in her bedroom
She opened her eyes and then squeezed my hand
She said I have to go now my time here is over
And with her final words she tried to help me understand

Patty Loveless,Daniel Prayed,"I read about a man one day
He wasted not his time away
He prayed to God
Every morning, noon and night

He cared not for the things of Baal
But trusted One who never fails
Oh Daniel prayed
Every morning, noon and night

Oh, Daniel served his living God
While upon this earth he trod
He prayed to God every morning, noon and night
He cared not for the king's decree
But trusted God who set him free
Oh Daniel prayed
Every morning, noon and night

They locked him in the lion's den
Because he would not honor men
But he prayed to God
Every morning, noon and night

The jaws were locked, it made him shout
And God soon brought him safely out
Oh, Daniel prayed
Every morning, noon and night

Oh, Daniel served his living God
While upon this earth he trod
He prayed to God every morning, noon and night
He cared not for the king's decree
But trusted God who set him free
Oh Daniel prayed
Every morning, noon and night

Now brother let us watch and pray
Like Daniel did from day to day
He prayed to God
Every morning, noon and night

We too can gladly dare and do
And pray to God, He'll see us through
Oh, Daniel prayed
Every morning, noon and night

Oh, Daniel served his living God
While upon this earth he trod
He prayed to God every morning, noon and night
He cared not for the king's decree
But trusted God who set hime free
Oh Daniel prayed
Every morning, noon and night"

Patty Loveless,I Try To Think About Elvis,"Oh I'm sorry I forgot where I was
I try to think about Elvis
Memphis
Oprah in the afternoon
I try to think about palm trees
Fig leaves
The creature from the black lagoon
I try to think about high heels
And good deals
Anything to get me through
I just can't concentrate
You're all I think about these days

I try to contemplate the cosmos
What goes
Round and round the sky at night
I try to think about champagne
Freight trains
Slowly rolling out of sight
I try to focus on the headlines
Street crimes
Everytime I think I might
I just can't concentrate
You're all I think about these days

My mind wanders where it will
When it settles right on you
I forget what I should say
I forget what I should do

My mind wanders where it will
When it settles right on you
I forget what I should say
I forget what I should do

Come on Patty get it together

I try to think about Shakespeare
Leap year
The Beatles or the Rolling Stones
I try to think about hair-do's
Tattoos
Sushi bars and saxophones
I try to think about the talk shows
New clothes
But I guess I should have known

Patty Loveless,You Don’t Even Know Who I Am,"She left the car in the driveway
She left the key in the door

She left a note in the kitchen
Next to the grocery list

It said, you don't even know who I am
You left me a long time ago
You don't even know who I am
So what do you care if I go

He left the ring on the pillow
He left the clothes on the floor
And he called her to say he was sorry
But he couldn't remember what for
So he said I've been doing some thinking
I've been thinking that maybe you're right
I go to work every morning
And I come home to you every night

Patty Loveless,I’m That Kind Of Girl,"There's a man in a Stetson hat, howlin' like an alley cat
Outside my window tonight
Sayin', ""Baby, put on something hot, meet me in the parking lot
About a quarter to nine""

I get the feelin' that he's never read Romeo and Juliet
I'm gettin' tired of these one night stands
But if you wanna make a real romance

I'm that kind of girl, I'm that kind of girl
I ain't the woman in red, I ain't the girl next door
But if somewhere in the middle's what you're lookin' for
I'm that kind of girl, I'm that kind of girl

Let me tell you that I like my lovin' just as much as any woman
But I'm drawin' the line
A little sensitivity always seems to get to me every time
I'm a sucker for a love-sick fool
The kind that carries all your books in school
I'm getting tired of these one night stands
But if you're lookin' for a real romance

I'm that kind of girl, I'm that kind of girl
I ain't the woman in red, I ain't the girl next door
But if somewhere in the middle's what you're lookin' for
I'm that kind of girl, I'm that kind of girl

I'm that kind of girl, I'm that kind of girl
I ain't the woman in red, I ain't the girl next door
But if somewhere in the middle's what you're lookin' for
I'm that kind of girl, I'm that kind of girl

I'm that kind of girl, oh whoa
I'm that kind of girl, oh whoa"
Patty Loveless,I Know You’re Married (But I Love You Still),"[Patty Loveless & Travis Tritt:]

[Intro]
I know you're married, but I love you still

[Verse 1]
The day I met you, my heart spoke to me
It said to love you through eternity
Not knowing that you were another's pride
I vowed I'd always be close by your side

[Chorus]
I love you darlin' and I always will
I know you're married but I love you still

[Verse 2]
You broke a heart, dear, that would die for you
I'd give the world if I could be with you
The game is over, now I know I've lost
My broken heart will have to pay the cost

[Chorus]
I love you darlin' and I always will
I know you're married but I love you still

[Tag]
You know I love you and I always will
I know you're married but I love you still
You know I love you and I always will
I know you're married but I love you still"
Patty Loveless,Two Coats,"Two coats were before me
And old and a new
I asked my sweet Master
Oh what must I do

The old coat was ugly
So tattered and torn
The other a new one
Had never been worn

I'll tell you the best thing
I ever did do
I took off the old coat
And put on the new

The first man was earthly
And made from the ground
We bore all his image
The whole world around

The next was my Savior
From heaven so fair
He brought me this new coat
You now see me wear

I'll tell you the best thing
I ever did do
I took off the old coat
And put on the new

Now this coat is suits me
And keeps me so warm
It's good in the winter
It's good in the storm

My Savior has dressed me
In a garment so rare
He brought me this new coat
You now see me wear

I'll tell you the best thing
I ever did do
I took off the old coat
And put on the new

I'll tell you the best thing
I ever did do
I took off the old coat
And put on the new"
Patty Loveless,Don’t Toss Us Away,"Well it seems that everyone we know
The loves grown cold, while ours stand the storm
One by one they break, it's such a shame
And now you say you want to do the same

Don't toss us away so thoughtlessly
It just ain't right, oh can't you see?
I still love you, I want you to stay
Darlin please don't toss us away

Well just think of all that we been through
The world we're building..me and you
How could all those years be tossed away
In just one moment, in just one day

Don't toss us away, it just ain't right
To let love die without a fight
I still love you, I want you to stay
Darlin please don't toss us away

So now I'm asking once again
To understand, to be my friend
Oh it hurts so bad to think you'd go
But still the same, I love you so

Don't toss us away so thoughtlessly
It just ain't right, oh can't you see?
I still love you, I want you to stay
Darlin please, don't toss us away

Oh darlin please
Don't toss us away"
Patty Loveless,Beautiful Star Of Bethlehem,"O beautiful star of Bethlehem
Shining far through shadows dim
Giving the light for those who long have gone
Guiding the wise men on their way
Unto the place where Jesus lay
O beautiful star of Bethlehem
Shine on

O beautiful star of Bethlehem
Shine upon us until the glory dawns
Give us a light to light the way
Unto the land of perfect day
O beautiful star of Bethlehem
Shine on

O beautiful star the hope of life
Guiding the pilgrims through the night
Over the mountains 'til the break of dawn
Into the light of perfect day
It will give out a lovely ray

O beautiful star of Bethlehem
Shine upon us until the glory dawns
Give us a light to light the way
Unto the land of perfect day

Patty Loveless,Here I Am,"Don't do it darlin'
Don't you dare look in there
You said you didn't want to see me
But you've been lookin' for me everywhere
And you know that you're gonna find me
If you keep on drinkin' fast
Cause honey I'm right there waitin' on you
At the bottom of your glass

And here I am
Here I am
In the bourbon and the water
That burn you just like a brand
Here I am

It ain't workin' darlin'
Hard as you may try
You keep hearin' the words you told me
In everyone's goodbye
And you know that you're just one step
From another one being gone
I know I've seen 'em all unravel
I've been watchin' it all along

And here I am
Here I am
In every lie you're hearin'
That burn you just like a brand
Here I am

And honey, I got over you passin' me over
A long time ago
And my pride was stronger when I was younger
Now I'd rather have you to know

That here I am
Here I am
I still carry a flame for you
Burnin' me like a brand
Here I am"
Patty Loveless,Lonely Too Long,"Well, good mornin'
Tell me how'd you sleep last night
You're still smiling
So we must've done something right
Don't feel guilty
Because you turned to me last night

We ain't done nothin' wrong
We've just been lonely too long
No, we ain't done nothin' wrong
We've just been lonely too long

It's only natural
When you've been too long in the dark
To look for comfort
And to warm yourself by the fire
We're just afraid
That we might get our fingers burned

But we ain't done nothin' wrong
We've just been lonely too long
No, we ain't done nothin' wrong
We've just been lonely too long

Nothing's wrong that can't be cured
With a new love
All you need is someone like me to
Be sure of, to be your love

I'll be waiting
Standing right outside your heart
And I'll be watching
For the slightest sign of a spark
And I'll be here
If you should want to turn to me

'Cause we ain't done nothin' wrong
We've just been lonely too long
No, we ain't done nothin' wrong
We've just been lonely too long

We ain't done nothin' wrong
We've both been lonely too long
Oh, just been lonely too long
Both been lonely too long
Just been lonely too long"
Patty Loveless,When The Fallen Angels Fly,"I have climbed so many mountains
Just to reach the other side
I near drowned myself in freedom
Just to feed my foolish pride
On my journey through the darkness
I have finally seen the light
I know no one's ever loved me
Like you're loving me tonight

There is something I must tell you
I wonder if you'll understand
How I found such worldly pleasures
In the arms of other men
You should never try to judge me
We have both been wrong and right
But I know no one's ever loved me
Like you're loving me tonight

God will save His fallen angels
And their broken wings He'll mend
When He draws their hearts together
And they learn to love again
All their sins will be forgiven
In the twinkle of an eye
All the saints rejoice in heaven
When the fallen angels fly

God will save His fallen angels
And their broken wings He'll mend
When He draws their hearts together
And they learn to love again
All their sins will be forgiven
In the twinkle of an eye
All the saints rejoice in heaven
When the fallen angels fly
When the fallen angels fly
When the fallen angels fly
All the saints rejoice in heaven
When the fallen angels fly"
Patty Loveless,Hurt Me Bad (In A Real Good Way),"Would've never found you
If he had wanted to stay
Oh, he hurt me bad
In a real good way

Well, he opened my eyes
To a world beyond
That impossible dream
I was living on

And I thank my lucky stars each night
When you're in my arms and you're holding me tight
I realize what it means to have your true love

I would've never found you
If he had wanted to stay
Oh, he hurt me bad
In a real good way

And I thank my lucky stars each night
When you're in my arms and you're holding me tight
I realize what it means to have your true love

When I look back on my life before
How my heart got shattered with a slamming door
I see how it all had to be for the two of us

Oh, the river of tears
That flow from my eyes
Was only moving me on
To this paradise

I would've never found you
If he had wanted to stay
Oh, he hurt me bad
In a real good way
Oh, he hurt me bad
In a real good way"
Patty Loveless,Halfway Down,"[Verse 1]
Raindrops on the treetops
Waitin' there to fall
I know how they're feeling
But I'm only, yes, I'm only
Halfway down

[Verse 2]
Fightin' with the devil
Harder all the time
Sinkin' to his level
But I'm only, yes, I'm only
Halfway down

[Chorus]
Halfway down, just a-gettin' started
Yes, I'm beginnin' on my journey now
But I've only gotten halfway down
Halfway down, just a little bit farther
Well, I believe you better catch me now
'Cause I'm only goin' halfway down

[Verse 3]
Sippin' shallow water
Sharks out for the kill
Almost hittin' bottom
But I'm only, yes, I'm only
Halfway down

[Chorus]
Halfway down, just a-gettin' started
Yes, I'm beginnin' on my journey now
But I've only gotten halfway down
Halfway down, just a little bit farther
Well, I believe you better catch me now
'Cause I'm only goin' halfway down
Yeah, I hope you better catch me now
'Cause I'm only goin' halfway down
Yes, I'm only goin' halfway down
Yes, I'm only goin' halfway down"
Patty Loveless,You Don’t Seem to Miss Me,"[Verse 1]
It's a long way off from where I should be goin'
And every time I hate to leave your side
But now when I return there's something missin'
When I'm gone you don't seem to miss me

[Verse 2]
Now life's so fast and everything is changing
And if you're changing too, then I don't blame you
I remember how you used to kiss me
But when I'm gone you don't seem to miss me

[Chorus]
I'm goin' back, I wonder why
I'm runnin' fast to get home
I just can't wait to see your face
But you don't seem to miss me

[Verse 3]
No one can take away the things you've given
And all the good we've had alone together
There was a time when you could not resist me
Now I'm gone, you don't seem to miss me

[Chorus]
I'm goin' back, I wonder why
I'm runnin' fast to get home
I just can't wait to see your face
But you don't seem to miss me

[Tag]
I can't wait to see your face
But you don't seem to miss me"
Patty Loveless,Rise Up Lazarus,"[Chorus]
Rise up, Lazarus, rise up from the dust
If in Jesus you believe, you shall be released
Go forth, John and Paul, spread the Gospel to them all
Give them courage to believe and they shall be released

[Verse 1]
Now Jesus went to Bethany in answer to an urgent plea
Two sisters fell down at his feet, they began to cry and weep
They led Him to their brother's grave, Jesus knelt to God and prayed

[Chorus]
Rise up, Lazarus, rise up from the dust
If in Jesus you believe, you shall be released
Go forth, John and Paul, spread the Gospel to them all
Give them courage to believe and they shall be released

[Verse 2]
Now doubters who had not believed spread the word of what they'd seen
Then they began to congregate, first two to four, then four to eight
God watched the faithful multiply as they echoed Jesus' cry

[Chorus]
Rise up, Lazarus, rise up from the dust
If in Jesus you believe, you shall be released
Go forth, John and Paul, spread the Gospel to them all
Give them courage to believe and they shall be released

[Verse 3]
Now all us children here on Earth sometimes doubt our worldly worth
But if in Jesus you do trust, you will rise like Lazarus
So if you're feelin' down and out, open up your heart and shout

[Chorus]
Rise up, Lazarus, rise up from the dust
If in Jesus you believe, you shall be released
Go forth, John and Paul, spread the Gospel to them all
Give them courage to believe and they shall be released

[Outro]
Give them courage to believe and they shall be released"
Patty Loveless,Chains,"Bought a ticket to Seattle but I can't get to the plane
Everytime I leave you I keep running out of chain
I hunger for your love it never gives me any slack
But if I ever break away, I'm never coming back to these

Chains, chains, shackles and chains
No matter what it takes some day I'm gonna break these
Chains, chains, shackles and chains
These love taking, heart breaking
Cold, hard, lonely making chains

You never try to hold me 'till you see me walking out
I guess you'd rather be with me than ever be without
You call me back and kiss me and my heart begins to sink
When I know that all you're doing's
Taking up another link in these

Chains, chains, shackles and chains
No matter what it takes some day I'm gonna break these
Chains, chains, shackles and chains
These love taking, heart breaking
Cold, hard, lonely making chains

Love was never meant to be a one-way street
I was never meant to be falling at your feet
You got me where you want me
And I don't know what to do
You don't belong to me but I belong to you in these

Chains, chains, shackles and chains
No matter what it takes some day I'm gonna break these
Chains, chains, shackles and chains
These love taking, heart breaking
Cold, hard, lonely making chains..."
Patty Loveless,Mr. Man In The Moon,"Mr. Man in the moon
Are you really blue
Are you shedding a tear
While you shine
If you feel like I do
Mr. Man in the moon
Then your heart must be
Broken like mine

Are you lonesome
There's not a star in sight
Well I'll be right here
We're both up for the night

Mr. Man in the moon
Are you really blue
Are you shedding a tear
While you shine
If you feel like I do
Mr. Man in the moon
Then your heart must be
Broken like mine

To the whole world
You show a smiling face
I feel like the dark side
That you hide away

Mr. Man in the moon
Are you really blue
Are you shedding a tear
While you shine
If you feel like I do
Mr. Man in the moon
Then your heart must be
Broken like mine"
Patty Loveless,She Drew a Broken Heart,"You should have seen it coming, now it's too late
She bought the half-price ticket on the midnight train
You wouldn't understand 'cause you lie and cheat
So she wrote it out in lipstick on your satin sheets

She drew a broken heart
She drew a broken heart
Torn right down the middle in a red jagged line
She drew a broken heart and put your name inside

She had to draw you a picture to make it sink in
Revlon rose was her poison pen
For God's gift to women you ain't got a clue
That red broken heart belongs to you

She drew a broken heart
She drew a broken heart
It ain't no cupid's arrow, it ain't no valentine
She drew a broken heart and put your name inside

No lovesick words gonna bring her back
The buck stops here, buddy, that's a fact
No matter who's right, no matter who's wrong
Anyway you cut it, she's gone

She drew a broken heart
She drew a broken heart
Torn right down the middle in a red jagged line
She drew a broken heart and put your name inside

Right down the middle
Right down the line
She drew a broken heart and put your name inside
Whoa, she's gone"
Travis Tritt,It’s A Great Day To Be Alive,"[Verse 1]
I got rice cookin' in the microwave
Got a three day beard I don't plan to shave
And it's a goofy thing but I just gotta say, hey
I'm doin' alright

[Verse 2]
Yeah I think I'll make me some homemade soup
I'm feelin' pretty good and that's the truth
It's neither drink nor drug induced, no
I'm just doin' alright

[Chorus]
And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shining
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good

[Verse 3]
It's been fifteen years since I left home
And said good luck to every seed I'd sown
Gave it my best and then I left it alone
I hope they're doin' alright

[Verse 4]
Now I look in the mirror and what do I see
A lone wolf there starin' back at me
Long in the tooth but harmless as can be
Lord I guess he's doing alright

[Chorus]
And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shining
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good

[Bridge]
Sometimes it's lonely, sometimes it's only me
And the shadows that fill this room
Sometimes I'm falling, desperately calling
Howlin' at the moon ah-ooh

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 5]
Well I might go get me a new tattoo
Or take my old Harley for a three day cruise
Might even grow me a Fu-Manchu

[Chorus]
And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shining
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good

[Chorus]
And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shining
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good"
Travis Tritt,Anymore,"[Verse 1]
I can't hide the way I feel about you
Anymore
I can't hold the hurt inside, keep the pain out of my eyes
Anymore

[Chorus]
My tears no longer waiting
My resistance ain't that strong
My mind keeps recreating
A life with you alone
And I'm tired of pretending
I don't love you anymore

[Verse 2]
Let me make one last appeal to show you how I feel
About you (Mhm)
'Cause there's no one else, I swear, holds a candle anywhere
Next to you (Mmm-hmm)

[Chorus]
My heart can't take the beating
Not havin' you to hold
A small voice keeps repeating
Deep inside my soul
It says I can't keep pretending
I don't love you anymore

[Bridge]
I've got to take the chance or let it pass by
If I expect to get on with my life

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
My tears no longer waiting
Oh, my resistance ain't that strong
But my mind keeps recreating
A life with you alone
And I'm tired of pretending
I don't love you anymore

Anymore
Anymore"
Travis Tritt,T-R-O-U-B-L-E,"[Verse 1]
Well, I play an old guitar from nine till half past one
I'm just tryin' to make a livin' watching everybody else havin' fun
Well, I don't miss much if it happens on a dancehall floor
Mercy look what just walked through that door

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 2]
I was a little bitty baby when my papa hit the skids
Mama had a time tryin' to raise nine kids
She told me not to stare cause it was impolite
She did the best she could to try to raise me right

[Chorus 2]
Cause mama never told me 'bout nothin' like Y-O-U
Bet your mama musta been another good lookin' honey too
Hey good L double O-K-I-N-G
Well, I smell T-R-O-U-B-L-E

[Verse 3]
Well, a sweet talkin', sexy walkin', honky tonkin' baby

Cause the world ain't ready for nothing like Y-O-U
I bet your mama musta been another good lookin' mama too

You say you were wrong to ever leave me alone
And now you're sorry, you're lonesome and scared
And you say you'd be happy if you could just come back home
Well, here's a quarter, call someone who cares

Call someone who'll listen, and might give a damn

Travis Tritt,Tell Me I Was Dreaming,"[Verse 1]
When I woke up this mornin'
Wiped the sleep from my eyes
I found a new day dawning
And suddenly I realized
You're gone

[Chorus]
Tell me I was dreamin'
That you didn't leave me here to cry
You didn't say you don't love me anymore
It was just my imagination tellin' lies
Tell me that you didn't say goodbye

[Verse 2]
I'm in a state of confusion
I hope things aren't what they seem
If this is really happening
Just let me go back to dream
You're home

Tell me I was dreamin'
That you didn't leave me here to cry
You didn't say you don't love me anymore
It was just my imagination tellin' lies

Travis Tritt,Help Me Hold On,"[Verse 1]
Baby, close that suitcase you've been packin'
Just sit down and talk to me a while
I know you tried to tell me what was lackin'
But I guess I must have missed it by a mile

[Verse 2]
Well, this time girl I swear to you I'll listen
Help me understand where I went wrong
It's hard to find myself in this position
Scared that I'll go crazy once you're gone

Help me hold on to what we had
Once our love was strong, it can be again
You said it takes two to make love last
You were right all along, so help me hold on

What have I got to do to make it better?
What have I got to do to make you see?
That even though I promised you forever
I never knew how hard that would be

But I've learned that love worth havin' don't come free
And I'll pay any price it takes to keep you

Travis Tritt,Take It Easy,"Well, I'm a runnin' down the road, tryin' to loosen my load
I've got seven women on my mind:
Four that wanna own me, two that wanna stone me
One says she's a friend of mine
Take it easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy
Lighten up while you still can, don't even try to understand
Just find a place to make your stand and take it easy

Well, I'm a standin' on a corner in Winslow, Arizona
And such a fine sight to see:
It's a girl, my Lord, in a flat bed Ford
Slowin' down to take a look at me
Come on, baby, don't say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me
We may lose and we may win though we will never be here again
So open up, I'm climbin' in, so take it easy

Well, I'm a runnin' down the road, tryin' to loosen my load
Got a world of trouble on my mind
Lookin' for a lover who won't blow my cover
She's so hard to find
Take it easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels make you crazy
Come on, baby, don't say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me

Oh, we got it easy
We oughta take it easy"
Travis Tritt,Foolish Pride,"[Verse 1]
She stayed up all night and cried into her pillow
And fought off the urge to just break down and call
Last night to find the fault seemed so darn easy
But now who's to blame don't matter much at all
She thinks if she calls him, it just shows weakness
So the hurt goes on with every tear she's cried
Ain't it sad to see a good love fall to pieces
Chalk another heartbreak up to foolish pride
[Chorus]
Turn out the lights, the competition's over
The stubborn souls are the losers here tonight
And while the bridges burn
Another hard, hard lesson's learned
As in the ashes passion slowly dies
And this romance goes down to foolish pride (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
He relives every word they spoke in anger
He walks the floor and punches out the wall
To apologize to her, would be so simple
But instead, he cries, ""I'll be damned if I'll crawl""
If he loses her, he's lost his best friend
And more than just a lover can provide
So he wrestles with emotions that defeat him
Chalk another love lost up to foolish pride

[Chorus]
Turn out the lights, the competition's over
The stubborn souls are the losers here tonight
Yeah, and while the bridges burn
Another hard, hard lesson's learned
As in the ashes passion slowly dies
And this romance goes down to foolish pride

[Outro]
Chalk another love lost up to foolish pride
Yeah-eah
Mmm"
Travis Tritt,I’m Gonna Be Somebody,"[Verse 1]
Bobby played his guitar on the harder side of town
Where it's hard for a poor boy to find the money
He had dedication, he had the heart and soul
Somehow knew he was born to play

[Verse 2]
People said ""Get a real job, support your family
'Cause there's no future on the road your takin'""
He never said a word, the dreamer just kept on
Late at night you could hear him say, he said

[Chorus]
I'm gonna be somebody
One of these days I'm gonna break these chains
I'm gonna be somebody someday
You can bet your hard-earned dollar I will

[Verse 3]
The road was a struggle, took him ten years to the top
And now he's number one on the stage and the radio
Still he can't believe how people come from miles around
When it seems like only yesterday when he would say

[Chorus]
I'm gonna be somebody
One of these days I'm gonna break these chains
I'm gonna be somebody someday
You can bet your hard-earned dollar I will, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 4]
Bobby played his hometown, one full moon August night
When he heard a voice in the front row singin'
It was a sandy-haired rebel boy with the same ol' hungry eyes
He looked up at Bobby and said (Mmm)

[Chorus]
I'm gonna be somebody
One of these days I'm gonna break these chains
And I'm gonna be somebody someday
You can bet your hard-earned dollar I will
You know I will, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
I'm gonna be somebody
One of these days I'm gonna break these chains
And I'm gonna be somebody someday
You can bet your hard-earned dollar I will, oh yeah
You can bet your hard-earned dollar I will"
Travis Tritt,The Whiskey Ain’t Workin’,"[Verse 1]
There was a time I could drink my cares away
And drown out all of the heartaches that hurt me night and day
When the thought of you came crashin' through, I'd have one more
But now the whiskey ain't workin' anymore

[Chorus]
I need one good honky tonk angel to turn my life around
That's reason enough for me to lay this old bottle down
A woman warm and willing, that's what I'm looking for
'Cause the whiskey ain't workin' anymore

[Verse 2]
They knew my name at every bar in town
And they knew all of the reasons why I was coming round, round, round (Sing it, Travis)
'Cause in my mind, peace I'd find, when they'd start to pour
But now the whiskey ain't workin' anymore (sing it, son)

[Chorus]
I need one good honky tonk angel to turn my life around
That's reason enough for me to lay this old bottle down
Well, a woman warm and willing, Lord, that's what I'm looking for (That's right)
'Cause the whiskey ain't workin' anymore

[Outro]
Lord, the whiskey ain't workin' anymore
That's for sure"
Travis Tritt,Bible Belt,"Well, he was the assistant preacher and a Sunday School teacher in the church that I grew up in
She was a looker from Atlanta; led the choir; played piano; had a body that was made for sin
She didn't care he was married 'cause the torch that she carried was hotter than the fires of Hell
She had plans to seduce him, and she knew she would loosen a notch in the Bible Belt

So she called him up at home when she knew he'd be alone, said, ""Preacher, I could use advice.""
""I got troubles with the Man that I know you'll understand. If you could help me it would sure be nice.""
They met a few minutes after in the office of the pastor, and she started telling how she felt
What a chance they were takin' when they first started breakin' the law from the Bible Belt

There's a lot of good people who were led astray that believe what the Good Book said
Well, I'll tell you something, brother, when you're dealin' with the Devil it's tough to keep a level head
And, it's hard to imagine how the flames of passion will burn 'til your soul will melt
And it'll spread like a cancer 'cause you're gonna have to answer to the Lord in the Bible Belt

Someone said they went to Vegas. Back home it didn't take us long to hear the news of what they did
I just can't believe that he left his wife to grieve alone with two pre-school kids
I don't know how they're doin', but I know that they're screwin' up a good thing they once had
They better get their heads together or they're gonna slap leather with the Lord in the Bible Belt

There's a lot of good people who were led astray that believe what the Good Book said
Well, I'll tell you something, brother, when you're dealin' with the Devil it's tough to keep a level head
And, it's hard to imagine how the flames of passion will burn 'til your soul will melt
And it'll spread like a cancer 'cause you're gonna have to answer to the Lord in the Bible Belt

They better get their heads together or they're gonna slap leather with the Lord in the Bible Belt

Amen, brother"
Travis Tritt,Smoke in a Bar,"[Verse 1]
Daddies were Daddies and Mamas were saints
What preachers were preachin', you could take to the bank
Kids played outside up until it turned dark
When the world turned slower and you could smoke in a bar

[Verse 2]
Trucks took a beatin', the workin' man too
You could turn on the six o'clock and get the whole truth
A seatbelt was a backup for Mama's right arm
When the world turned slower and you could smoke in a bar

[Chorus]
My, oh my, how times have changed
But man, sometimes, I miss them old days
They say we'vе come a long way, but I'd say it's a little bit too far
From when thе world turned slower and you could smoke in a bar

[Verse 3]
Neighbors came by and talked on the porch
We all said goodnight and never locked the front door
Even downtown, you could still see the stars
When the world turned slower and you could smoke in a bar

[Chorus]
My, oh my, how times have changed
But man, sometimes, I miss them old days
They say we've come a long way, but I'd say it's a little bit too far
From when the world turned slower and you could smoke in a bar

[Bridge]
A deal was a deal when you shook a man's hand
When we saw the flag flyin', we all gave a damn

[Chorus]
My, oh my, how times have changed
But man, sometimes, I miss them old days
They say we've come a long way, but I'd say it's a little bit too far
From when the world turned slower and you could smoke in a bar
From when the world turned slower and you could smoke in a bar"
Travis Tritt,Country Club,"[Verse 1]
I took a double take out on the interstate
When I saw her making eyes at me
So I followed her down to Clubhouse Drive
Past the pool and the eighteenth green
And in the parking lot I said it's mighty hot
Maybe I could buy you a beer
She said I'm glad you asked, but I'll have to pass
'Cause only members are allowed in here (and I said)

[Chorus]
I'm a member of a country club
Country music is what I love
I drive an old Ford pick-up truck
I do my drinking from a Dixie cup
Hey I'm a bona-fide dancing fool
I shoot a mighty mean game of pool
At any honky tonk or roadside pub
I'm a member of a country club

[Verse 2]
Lord, you look so inviting, thought it might be exciting
For a woman with a limousine
To go bouncing around in a beat-up truck
With a man in wore-out jeans
Yeah, it's five o'clock before Friday night
And here's where the fun begins
So don't worry 'bout your reputation
'Cause you can tell all your friends

[Chorus]
That I'm a member of a country club
Country music is what I love
I drive an old Ford pick-up truck
I do my drinking from a Dixie cup
Hey I'm a bona-fide dancing fool
I shoot a mighty mean game of pool
At any honky tonk or roadside pub
I'm a member of a country club

[Chorus]
Hey I'm a member of a country club
Country music is what I love
I drive an old Ford pick-up truck
I do my drinking from a Dixie cup
Hey I'm a bona-fide dancing fool
I shoot a mighty mean game of pool
At any honky tonk or roadside pub
I'm a member of a country club

[Tag]
At any honky tonk or roadside pub
I'm a member of a country club"
Travis Tritt,Best of Intentions,"[Verse 1]
I had big plans for our future
Said I'd give you the whole world somehow
I tried makin' good on that promise
Thought I'd be so much further by now
Never could build you a castle
Even though you're the queen of my heart
But I've had the best of intentions from the start

[Verse 2]
Now some people think I'm a loser
'Cause I seldom get things right
But you make me feel like a winner
When you wrap me in your arms so tight
Please tell me you will remember
No matter how much I do wrong
That I had the best of intentions all along

[Chorus]
I'd gave you a ring, and I promised you things
I always thought we'd do
But my best-laid plans slipped right through my hands
To show my love for you
And if you could read my heart
Then you'd know without exception
It was all with the best of intentions

[Chorus]
I'd gave you a ring, and I promised you things
I always thought we'd do
But my best-laid plans slipped right through my hands
To show my love for you
And if you could read my heart
Then you'd know without exception
It was all with the best of intentions

[Outro]
So here I am asking forgiveness
And praying that you'll understand
Don't think I take you for granted
Girl, I know just how lucky I am
Though you deserve so much better
You won't find devotion more true
'Cause I've had the best of intentions
Girl, I've had the best of intentions
Yes, I've had the best of intentions
Loving you"
Travis Tritt,Modern Day Bonnie and Clyde,"[Chorus]
Well, it's a long way to Richmond
Rollin' north on 95
With a redhead ridin' shotgun
And a pistol by my side
Tearin' down that highway
Like a modern day Bonnie and Clyde

[Verse 1]
We met at a truckstop
Johnson City, Tennessee
I was gassin' up my Firebird
When I heard her callin' me, mm-mm
Said, ""Which way are you headed, boy
Do you need some company?""

[Verse 2]
She had me stoppin' at a quick mart
Before we made it out of town
Next thing she was runnin' at me
Tellin' me to lay that hammer down
Cause there's a man right behind me
Doin' his best to slow me down

[Chorus]
Yeah, and it's a long way to Richmond
Rollin' north on 95
With a redhead ridin' shotgun
And a pistol by my side
Tearin' down that highway
Like a modern day Bonnie and Clyde
Woo

[Bridge]
Well, we pulled up to a motel
In the middle of the night
We were countin' all the money
Smokin' stolen Marlboro lights
Lord we never saw 'em comin'
'Til they read us both our rights

[Chorus]
Yeah, and it's a long way to Richmond
Rollin' north on 95
With a sheriff right beside me
Pistol pointed at my side
Oh, Lord, such a disappointing ending
For this modern day Bonnie and Clyde
Yeah

[Outro]
Whoa
Well
Woo-hoo"
Travis Tritt,Can I Trust You with My Heart,"[Verse 1]
When you meet that certain someone you've been searching hard to find
It's a new love full of passion that can sometimes make you blind
I don't mind being swept away if I know right from the start
So before we go much further girl, can I trust you with my heart

[Verse 2]
In the time we've spent together, I have learned to trust in you
So many things you've given before I even asked you to
But reality and romance are sometimes far apart
So what I really need to know is, can I trust you with my heart

[Chorus]
Can I cast my cares upon you, can you stand the heavy load
Can I count on you to walk me down that long and winding road
If you promise me these simple things, I can guarantee
You can always count on me girl, oh

[Chorus]
Can I cast my cares upon you, can you stand the heavy load
Can I count on you to walk me down that long and winding road
When two hearts solely surrender, and are sworn to understand
It completes a perfect union between a woman and a man
So please don't misunderstand me, I don't want to go too far
Without knowing just one answer, can I trust you with my heart

[Tag]
Please girl
Give me just one answer
Can I trust you with my heart"
Travis Tritt,Drift Off to Dream,"(Travis Tritt/Stewart Harris)

I sit here surrounded by people and lights
Alone with my drink at the bar
You've been here forever, so clear in my mind
I just don't know where you are
I know I'll find you but girl 'til I do
This is my love song for you

Let's hold hands on the porch swing, under the moon
While the wind through the willows plays us a tune
We can lie on a blanket, out back in the yard
And wish for our future on a faraway star
You'll feel the passion as time after time
I press your sweet lips to mine
Then we'll dance to the radio, right up 'til dawn
'Til you drift off to dream in my arms

You might be hundreds or more miles away
Or you might be just down the street
But there'll be a hunger deep in your eyes
That I'll recognize when we meet
It might take hours or it might take years
But this is the song you will hear

Let's hold hands on the porch swing, under the moon
While the wind through the willows plays us a tune
We can lie on a blanket, out back in the yard
And wish for our future on a faraway star
You'll feel the passion as time after time
I press your sweet lips to mine
Then we'll dance to the radio, right up 'til dawn
'Til you drift off to dream in my arms"
Travis Tritt,Where Corn Don’t Grow,"[Verse 1]
As we sat on the front porch of that old grey house where I was born and raised
Starin' at the dusty fields where my daddy worked hard every day
I think it kinda hurt him when I said, ""Daddy there's a lot that I don't know
But don't you ever dream about a life where corn don't grow?""

[Verse 2]
He just sat there silent, starin' at his favorite coffee cup
I saw a storm of mixed emotion in his eyes when he looked up
He said, ""Son, I know at your age it seems like this ole world is turnin' slow
And you think you'll find the answer to it all where corn don't grow""

[Chorus]
Hard times are real
There's dusty fields no matter where you go
But you may change your mind
'Cause the weeds are high where corn don't grow

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I remember feelin' guilty when daddy turned and walked back in the house
I was only seventeen back then but I thought that I knew more than I know now
I can't say he didn't warn me, this city life's a hard row to hoe
Ain't it funny how a dream can turn around where corn don't grow?

[Chorus]
Hard times are real
There's dusty fields no matter where you go
And you may change your mind
'Cause the weeds are high where corn don't grow
You may change your mind
Oh, the weeds are high where corn don't grow"
Travis Tritt,More Than You’ll Ever Know,"I know living with me ain't always easy
I dam up emotions some men just let flow
But girl when you're not by my side I feel a part of me has died
'Cause I love you more than you'll ever know

(Chorus)
More than life, more than I've ever loved before
It's absurd and beyond words, I couldn't want you more
And when I try to pour my heart out to you I'm not sure it shows
That I love you more than you'll ever know

I'm sure you've heard it said hearts have windows
But mine has doors a painful past has closed
Unless someday they open wide revealing feelings locked inside
I'll love you more than you'll ever know

Repeat (Chorus)
Even when I pour my heart out to you I'm not sure it shows
That I love you more than you'll ever know

Yes I love you more than you'll ever know"
Travis Tritt,Lord Have Mercy on the Working Man,"All around I hear the sound of money
But I ain't got a nickel to my name
And everywhere I look I see temptation
She stands on every corner and calls my name

Won't you tell me if you can
'Cause life's so hard to understand
Why's the rich man busy dancing
While the poor man pays the band
Oh, they're billing me for killing me
Lord, have mercy on the working man

Uncle Sam's got his hands in my pockets
And he helps himself each time he needs a dime
Them politicians treat me like a mushroom
'Cause they feed me bull and keep me in the blind

Won't you tell me if you can
'Cause life's so hard to understand
Why's the rich man busy dancing
While the poor man pays the band
Oh, they're billing me for killing me
Lord, have mercy on the working man

Hey, St. Peter, look down for a minute
And see this little man about to drown
There's quicksand all around and man I'm in it
Please help me up Lord, 'cause I'm going down

Won't you tell me if you can
'Cause life's so hard to understand
Why's the rich man busy dancing
While the poor man pays the band
Oh, they're billing me for killing me
Lord, have mercy on the working man

Won't you tell me if you can
'Cause life's so hard to understand
Why's the fat man busy dancing
While the thin man pays the band
Oh, they're billing me for killing me
Lord, have mercy on the working man

Please Lord, have mercy on the working man
Please Lord, have mercy on the working man..."
Travis Tritt,Sometimes Love Just Ain’t Enough,"[Verse 1]
I don't want to lose you
But I don't want to use you
Just to have somebody by my side
I don't want to hate you
I don't want to take you
But I don't want to be the one to cry

And that don't really matter to anyone anymore
But like a fool
I keep losing my place
And I keep seeing you walk through that door

[Chorus]
But there's a danger in loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know it's your heart you can't trust
There's a reason why people don't stay where they are
Baby, sometimes, love just ain't enough

Now, I could never change you
I don't want to blame you
Baby, you don't have to take the fall
Yes, I may have hurt you
But I did not desert you
Maybe I just want to have it all

It makes a sound like thunder
It makes me feel like rain
And like a fool who will never see the truth
I keep thinking something's gonna change

[Chorus]
But there's a danger in loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know it's your heart you can't trust
There's a reason why people don't stay where they are
Baby, sometimes love just ain't enough

[Bridge]
And there's no way home
When it's late at night and you're all alone
Are there things that you wanted to say?
And do you feel me beside you in your bed
There beside you where I used to lay?

[Chorus]
And there's a danger in loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know it's your heart they can't touch
There's a reason why people don't stay who they are
Baby, sometimes, love just ain't enough
Baby, sometimes, love
It just ain't enough
Oh, Oh, Oh, No"
Travis Tritt,Helping Me Get Over You,"(Featuring Lari White)
(Travis Tritt/Lari White)

You ask who's lying in my bed
Is it really love we're making
My heart's hanging by a thread
She's the only reason it ain't breaking
Do you ever cross my mind
Darling fact is you still do
That's the reason she is here
Wiping your old memory clear
She's helping me get over you

Helping me get over you
One kiss at a time
'Cause all the pain that we've been through
Still weighs so heavy on my mind
Getting past the love we lost
That's a lonely bridge to cross
So I did what I had to do
I had to find somebody new
Who's helping me get over you

I know you'd never ask his name
But in your heart I know you wonder
I'm not much good at playing games
I'm just trying to keep from going under
There's no forever in his eyes
It's not the love that we once knew
Oh and it might be a sin
But tonight I've got a friend
Helping me get over you

Helping me get over you
One kiss at a time
'Cause all the pain that we've been through
Still weighs so heavy on my mind
Getting past the love we lost
That's a lonely bridge to cross
So I did what I had to do
I had to find somebody new
Who's helping me get over you

Oh I did the best that I could do
I had to find somebody new
To help me get over you"
Travis Tritt,Ten Feet Tall and Bulletproof,"(Travis Tritt)

I'm a full grown man; that's plain to see
But nowhere near as full grown as I'd like to be
But I'll find a bar, and I'll have a few
Until I'm ten feet tall and bulletproof

Now, I'd hit the dance floor each time I'd have the chance
That is if these two left feet knew how to dance
'Bout the only time I'm kicking up my shoes
Is when I'm ten feet tall and bulletproof

Well, I start to feel like Superman
Then I pick a fight
Only to find that my opponent's
Holding kryptonite
You'd think I'd learn my lesson
But, I'm still paying dues
Each time I drink and start to think
I'm ten feet tall and bulletproof

My woman left me; she called me a clown
Well, that's the general consensus in this town
But I had it coming, Lord, to tell the truth
For acting ten feet tall and bulletproof

Well, I start to feel like Superman
Then I pick a fight
Only to find that my opponent's
Holding kryptonite
You'd think I'd learn my lesson
But, I'm still paying dues
Each time I drink and start to think
I'm ten feet tall and bulletproof

Yeah, each time I drink and start to think
I'm ten feet tall and bulletproof

Try me, brother"
Travis Tritt,Strong Enough to Be Your Man,"[Verse]
I know there's times
You've been tormented by
The questions in your mind
Will our love last
Or simply fade away
As time begins to pass

[Chorus]
You're a complicated lady
That's for sure
With a need for someone unafraid
To make you feel secure
And if you wonder if I'm strong enough
To be your man
Yes, I am
Yes, I am

[Bridge]
Don't let yourself imagine it's a lie
I'm not the kind to turn and say goodbye
And even though you test my soul
And make yourself so hard to hold
I'm gonna make you understand
I'm strong enough to be your man

[Verse]
Do you believe
When I look in your eyes
And swear I'll never leave
What will it take
To make you know that what we have
Is here to stay

[Chorus]
Yes, I know that you've been loved
And left before
But I promise you won't ever see me
Walking out the door
And if you wonder if I'm strong enough
To be your man
Yes, I am
Yes, I am

[Outro]
I know there's times
You've been tormented by
The questions in your mind"
Travis Tritt,Set in Stone,"[Verse 1]
This old heart, these old hands
Made a good life for this old man
You can call it passion, call it stubborn pride
Call it what you want, but I feel it inside
Same old fire burnin' like it did
A white-hot flame even when I was a kid
I've finally come far enough to know
The living's in the gettin' where you wanna go

[Chorus]
Mornin' sun up and gone
Lord, shine your light on a workin' man's home
I still do what I've always done
I shoot straight, I'm a son of a gun
And I don't worry 'bout when I'm gone
My legacy is set in stone

[Verse 2]
Saw it with some family, saw it with some friends
How a candle burns when you light both ends
It don't take long, the consequence is real
Nobody wins when the devil does the deal
Coulda took the path, forever runnin' wild
If not for the wisdom, a father to a child
Picture of the man my daddy was to me
Set me up a plan for who I wanna be

[Chorus]
Mornin' sun up and gone
Lord, shine your light on a workin' man's home
I still do what I've always done
I shoot straight, I'm a son of a gun
And I don't worry 'bout when I'm gone
My legacy is set in stone

[Chorus]
Morning sun up and gone
Lord, shine your light
On a working man's home
I still do what I've always done
I shoot straight, I'm a son of a gun
And I don't worry 'bout when I'm gone
My legacy is set in stone
Lord, it's set in stone"
John Anderson,Seminole Wind,"[Verse 1]
Ever since the days of old
Men would search for wealth untold
They'd dig for silver and for gold
And leave the empty holes

[Verse 2]
And way down south in the Everglades
Where the blackwater rolls and the sawgrass waves
The eagles fly and the otters play
In the land of the Seminole

[Chorus]
So blow, blow Seminole wind
Blow like you're never gonna blow again
I'm calling to you like a long-lost friend
But I know who you are
And blow, blow from the Okeechobee
All the way up to Micanopy
Blow across the home of the Seminoles
The alligators and the gar

[Verse 3]
Progress came and took its toll
And in the name of flood control
They made their plans and they drained the land
Now the glades are going dry

[Verse 4]
And the last time I walked in the swamp
I sat upon a Cypress stump
I listened close and I heard the ghost
Of Osceola cry

[Chorus]
So blow, blow Seminole wind
Blow like you're never gonna blow again
I'm calling to you like a long-lost friend
But I know who you are
And blow, blow from the Okeechobee
All the way up to Micanopy
Blow across the home of the Seminoles
The alligators and the gar"
John Anderson,Years,"[Chorus]
Years
Everybody knows you gotta let 'em go
And they kinda roll by like tears
Just a measure of time
Playin' with your mind, passin' you by, those years

[Verse 1]
Look around, up and down
They're nowhere to be found
Like the wind, my old friends
They come and go again

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't look back in sorrow
Just hope you see tomorrow

[Chorus]
Those years
Everybody knows you gotta let 'em go
And they kinda roll by like tears
Just a measure of time
Playin' with your mind, passin' you by, those years

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
You and me came to be
We raised a family
When we're gone, they live on
To see what we won't see

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't look back in sorrow
The children have tomorrow

[Chorus]
Those years
Everybody knows you gotta let 'em go
And they kinda roll by like tears
Just a measure of time
Playin' with your mind, passin' you by, those years
Everybody knows you gotta let 'em go
And they kinda roll by like tears
Just a measure of time
Playin' with your mind and passin' you by, those years

Oh, Lord"
John Anderson,Swingin’,"[Verse 1]
There's a little girl in our neighborhood
Her name is Charlotte Johnson and she's really lookin' good
I had to go and see her, so I called her on the phone
I walked over to her house and this was goin' on

[Verse 2]
Her brother was on the sofa, eatin' chocolate pie
Her mama was in the kitchen, cuttin' chicken up to fry
Her daddy was in the backyard, rollin' up a garden hose
I was on the porch with Charlotte, feelin' love down to my toes

[Chorus]
And we were swingin' (Swingin')
Yes, we were swingin' (Swingin')
Little Charlotte, she's as pretty as the angels when they sing
I can't believe I'm out here on her front porch in this swing
Just a-swingin' (Swingin')

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Yeah, and we'll be swingin' (Swingin')
Yes, we'll be swingin' (Swingin')
Little Charlotte, she's as pretty as the angels when they sing
I can't believe I'm out here on her front porch in the swing
Just a-swingin' (Swingin')

[Verse 3]
Now, Charlotte, she's the darlin', she's the apple of my eye
And when I'm on the swing with her it makes me almost high
And Charlotte is my lover and she has been since the spring
I just can't believe it started on her front porch in this swing

[Chorus]
Just a-swingin' (Swingin')
Well, just a-swingin' (Swingin')
Little Charlotte, she's as pretty as the angels when they sing
I can't believe I'm out here on her front porch in the swing
Just a-swingin' (Swingin')
I said, Little Charlotte, she's as pretty as the angels when they sing
I can't believe I'm out here on her front porch in the swing
Just a-swingin' (Swingin', swingin')"
John Anderson,Straight Tequila Night,"[Verse 1]
If you really want to know
She comes here a lot
She just loves to hear the music and dance
K13 is her favorite song
If you play it you might have a chance
Tonight she's only sippin' white wine
She's friendly and fun lovin'
Most of the time

[Chorus]
But don't ask her on a straight tequila night
She'll start thinkin' about him, and she's ready to fight
Blames her broken heart on every man in sight
On a straight tequila night

[Verse 2]
Here's a glass of chablis, some quarters in change
Maybe you can turn her love life around
Then she won't need the salt or the lime anymore
To shoot that old memory down
Just remember her heart's on the mend
If you ever come back to see her again

[Chorus]
Don't ask her on a straight tequila night
She'll start thinkin' about him, and she's ready to fight
Blames her broken heart on every man in sight
On a straight tequila night

[Chorus]
Don't ask her on a straight tequila night
She'll start thinkin' about him, and she's ready to fight
Blames her broken heart on every man in sight
On a straight tequila night

[Outro]
But don't ask her on a straight tequila night
She'll start thinkin' about him, and she's ready to fight
Blames her broken heart on every man in sight
On a straight tequila night"
John Anderson,Black Sheep,"[Verse 1]
My daddy was a brakeman
On a highball traveling train
Mama she raised four little children
And the family had a good name
And papa and mama wanted
All for us they never had
Big brother, little brother, sister too
None of them turned out half bad

[Refrain]
Except me
I'm the black sheep of the family

[Verse 2]
Big brother went to college
And became a doctor man
I guess he makes about a million dollars a year
Off the folks on insurance plan
He's got a big long Mercedes Benz
And a house overlooking the town
He sits in his Jacuzzi
And he watches the sun go down

[Refrain]
And he feels real sorry for me
I'm the black sheep of the family

[Chorus]
Yeah, I drive me a big ol' semi truck
I'm makin' payments on a two room shack
My wife, she waits on tables
And at night she rubs my back
And I tell her what my papa said to my mama
When he got off a highball train
Wake me up early, be good to my dogs
And teach my children to pray

[Verse 3]
Little sister married a banker
Yeah, he owns a country club
He bought her a big ol' racing horse
And a funny lookin' little dog
He buys her big rings and diamonds
And a brand new Japanese yacht
They like to get together and talk about
All the things they've got

[Refrain]
But they never mention me
I'm the black sheep of the family

[Chorus]
Yeah, I drive me a big ol' semi truck
I'm makin' payments on a two room shack
My wife, she waits on tables
And at night she rubs my back
And I tell her what my papa said to my mama
When he got off a highball train
Wake me up early, be good to my dogs
And teach my children to pray

[Outro]
I'm sayin' woman, wake me up early, be good to my dogs
And teach my children to pray"
John Anderson,There Was A Time When I Was Alone,"There was a time when I was alone
I was alright by myself

Then you came to me and I began to see what love is about
No one else could know how I love you so
And I can't live without the love you give
Now that you're mine
I will love you till the end of time

The little things you say
Brighten up my day when I'm feelin' blue
Time and time again you have been a friend when I needed you

Then you came to me and I began to see our love that was true
Time and time again you have been a friend when I needed you

There was a time when I was alone"
John Anderson,"If It Ain’t Broke, Don’t Fix It","If it ain't broke, don't fix it
If it's mixed, don't try to mix it
Think before you speak and look before you leap
And if it's wound up don't try to wind it
If it's not lost don't try to find it
It always helps to make it easy on yourself

Make it easy on yourself and do the best that you can do
Stay away from folks who try to make it hard on you
And if it's wound up don't try to wind it
If it's not lost don't try to find it
It always helps to make it easy on yourself

If it ain't true, don't tell it
If it's sold don't try to sell it
Search and you will find, keep an open mind
And if it's short don't make it long
If it's right don't make it wrong
It always helps to make it easy on yourself

Make it easy on yourself and do the best that you can do
Stay away from folks who try to make it hard on you
And if it's short don't make it long
If it's right don't make it wrong
It always helps to make it easy on yourself
It always helps to make it easy on yourself"
John Anderson,Red Georgia Clay,"One rainy night in Dalton they were talkin' in the bar
About two bodies they'd been searching for
Behind old Samson's sawmill, the blood hounds found their grave
They were layin' in that red Georgia clay

So I just sit and listen, and drank my whiskey down
I knew I'd never make it out of town
When a big hand grabbed my shoulder, I started shakin' in my boots
And I knew the time had come to tell the truth

I said I followed them one evening when the sun was sinkin' low
I knew that loggin' shack was where they'd go
But when I watched 'em love together, it was more than I could take
So I left them layin' in that red Georgia clay

I may be hungry, cold and lonely in this ol' prison cell
And when I die I guess I'll go to hell
But at least I know she won't be runnin' 'round on me today
'Cause they're layin' in the red Georgia clay

Arm and arm together, they both wanted it that way
So I left them layin' in that Red Georgia clay
Yeah, I left them layin' in that Red Georgia clay"
John Anderson,Wild and Blue,"[Verse 1]
Way across town a phone rings off the wall
If you know he ain't home, why do you keep calling?
You're gonna drive yourself crazy and you know that it's true
It's just making you wild and blue

[Chorus]
Wild and blue, it's no wonder
Look at the things that you do
They could just take you up yonder, honey
You're already wild and blue

[Verse 2]
In somebody's room on the far side of town
With your minds all made up and the shades all pulled down
Someone is trying to satisfy you
He don't know you're wild and you're blue

[Chorus]
Wild and blue, it's no wonder
Look at the things that you do
They could just take you up yonder, honey
You're already wild and blue

[Verse 3]
It's four in the morning and you're all alone
With no place to go, why don't you come home?
I'll be right here baby, waiting for you
I know you've been wild and blue

[Chorus]
Wild and blue, it's no wonder
Look at the things that you do
They could just take you up yonder, honey
You're already wild and blue
Wild and blue, it's no wonder
Look at the things that you do
They could just take you up yonder, honey
You're already wild and blue

[Outro]
Wild and blue
It's no"
John Anderson,1959,"[Verse 1]
Cigarettes were a quarter then
Bobby-socks and jeans were in
Elvis sang the songs that we loved so
But the most important thing to us
Was keepin' gas in my old truck
So I could take us to the drive-in show

[Verse 2]
Then graduation finally came
Uncle Sam called me away
You married someone else while I was gone
But I kept your letter all these years
And I can't help but shed a tear
When I read the words you wrote me years ago

[Chorus]
Baby I'm yours
I'll love you always
I'm gonna stand by you until the end of time
Remember all of the good things
That we shared together
Signed - love Betty - 1959

[Verse 3]
I never will forget the day
When you and I went all the way
I was the first for you - and you for me
I've still got the truck that we loved in
It takes me back there now and then
Back to '59 in my memory

[Chorus]
Baby I'm yours
I'll love you always
I'm gonna stand by you until the end of time
Remember all of the good things
That we shared together
Signed - love Betty - 1959"
John Anderson,Chicken Truck,"[Verse 1]
Well it was mornin' when I left Alabama
It must have been around in Mid July
I got behind a chicken truck from Georgia
And the feathers were a flyin' like snow out of the sky

[Verse 2]
I couldn't get up the speed enough to pass him
And a funny smell was a gettin' close to me
And somethin' keeps on messing up my windshield
And the farther I go the harder it get's to see

[Chorus]
Chicken truck chicken truck behind it I'm stuck
Chicken truck chicken truck it's just my luck
Chicken truck on Highway 65
Well the hens are a sqaukin' and the roosters are a crowin'
Slowin' me down when I need to get goin'
Chicken truck on Highway 65

[Verse 3]
He slowed down and I finally got around him
On a big long hill just south of Tennessee
He had a box of Colonel Sander's on his dashboard
And he was eatin' fried chicken and throwin' his bones on me

[Chorus]
Chicken truck chicken truck behind it I'm stuck
Chicken truck chicken truck it's just my luck
Chicken truck on Highway 65
Well the hens are a sqaukin' and the roosters are a crowin'
He's slowin' me down when I need to keep goin'
Chicken truck on Highway 65

[Outro]
Chicken truck chicken truck behind it I'm stuck
Chicken truck chicken truck Lord it's just my luck
Chicken truck chicken truck
Chicken truck chicken truck"
John Anderson,Haunted House,"I just moved in my new house today
Moving was hard but I got squared away
Bells started ringing and chains rattled loud
I knew I'd done moved in a haunted house

Still I made up my mind to stay
And nothing was gonna drive me away
Till I seen something that gave me the creeps
It had a one big eye and two big feet

I stood right still and I did the freeze
And it did stroll right up to me
Made a noise with his feet that sounded like a drum
Said, ""Don't you be here when morning comes""

Say if I be here when morning comes
I'll be right here and I ain't gonna run
'Cause I bought this house and you know I'm boss
And ain't no haunt gonna run me off

In the kitchen the stove was a blazing hot
The coffee was a boiling in the old pot
Oh the grease had melted in my pan
I had a hunk of meat in my hand

He ate the raw meat right from my hand
Then he drank all the grease from the frying pan
Said to me, ""Boy, you better run
And don't you be here when morning comes""

Say if I be here when morning comes
I'll be right here and I ain't gonna run
'Cause I bought this house now you know I'm boss
And ain't no haunt like you's gonna run me off"
John Anderson,I Wish I Could Have Been There,"When our baby Kate was born it was the biggest day of my life
Lying there, little bows in her hair
In the loving arms of my wife
I was the proudest papa in the USA
Makin' a living on the road somewhere a thousand miles away

It was a happy day, but kinda' sad
And I wish I coulda' been there
Yea I wish I coulda' been there
I wish I coulda been there for that

Little Bobby hit his first home run
He was the hero of the home town crowd
Two to one, it was a winning run
Everybody was cheering loud
And mommy she was smilin' saying he's a chip off of the old block
But I was on the road somewhere between Memphis and Little Rock

It was a happy day but kinda' sad
And I wish I coulda' been there
Yea I wish I coulda' been there
I wish I coulda' been there for that

Now Bobby and Kate are all grown up
And moved away
They stay in touch
We're proud of the two good kids we raised
And it's hard to believe we are celebrating our twenty fifth year today
This party's nice but the kids aren't here
At least they called to say
Congratulations mom and dad

I wish we could have been there
I wish we could have been there
I wish we could have been there for that
It was a happy day, but kinda' sad
And I wish they could have been there
Yea I wish they could have been there
I wish they could have been there, for that"
John Anderson,Money In The Bank,"[Verse 1]
It's Friday night, baby, get ready, set, go
Gonna take you to the Krystal and a picture show
Well, the sky's the limit, there's no price too high
Baby, you're the apple of my eye
Got my paycheck in my pocket and some gas in the tank:
Honey, your love's better than money in the bank

[Verse 2]
I wish I had a bass boat and a Z-28
But I guess that stuff'll have to wait
'Cause I'm saving on a washer and a wedding ring
I want this love to be a lasting thing
Right at the top, that's where you rank:
Honey, your love's better than money in the bank

[Interlude]
Oh, oh, you make me feel like a million bucks
Oh, oh, I oughta drive you around in an armored truck

[Verse 3]
Late last night, I had a crazy dream
I met a man who invented a money machine
He said: ""I know things are tight and times are tough,""
But he'd give me the machine if I'd give you up
I just looked him in the eye and I said: ""No thanks.""
Honey, your love's better than money in the bank
Honey, your love's better than money in the bank"
John Anderson,When It Comes to You,"If we can't get along
We aught to be apart
And I'm wondering where'd you
Get that cold cold heart

Set me free
Sign my release
I'm tired of being a
Villian of the peace

You've been giving me bad times
Tell me what'd I do
How come I always get a hard time
Honey, when it comes to you
Saying things that you didn't have to
How come I always get a hard time
Honey when it comes to you

You only get one life
And this I know
I want to get my licks
In now before I go

Fire of love
Is dead and cold
I got to satisfy
The hunger in my soul

You been giving me bad times
Tell me what'd I do
How come I always get a hard time
Honey when it comes to you
Saying things that you didn't have to

If we can't get along
We aught to be a part
And I'm wondering where'd you
Get that cold cold heart

Set me free
Sign my release

Saying things that you didn't have to
How come I always get a hard time
Honey when it comes to you
How come I always get a hard time

John Anderson,"Shoot Low, Sheriff!","Well you better shoot low sheriff 'cause they might be crawlin'
Got a big load of booze that they'll soon be a-haulin'
They're running every night when the whipporwill is callin'
So shoot low sheriff 'cause they might be crawlin'

Old Uncle Bill's got a still on a hill
He never worked a day and I guess he never will
He runs shine liquor that he sells it to Paw
It made Maw mad and she called the law

Got a big load of booze that they'll soon be a-haulin'
They're running every night when the whipporwill is callin'

So shoot low sheriff 'cause they might be crawlin'""

Yeah, you better shoot low sheriff 'cause they might be crawlin'
Got a big load of booze that they'll soon be a-haulin'
They're running every night when the whipporwill is callin'
So shoot low sheriff 'cause they might be crawlin'

Uncle Bill held the bottle 'tween his finger and thumb
He said if I leave any, you can have some
Make him reach into his pocket for his last thin dime
And wear summer britches in the cold winter time

Yeah, you better shoot low sheriff 'cause they might be crawlin'
Got a big load of booze that they'll soon be a-haulin'
They're running every night when the whipporwill is callin'

John Anderson,Bend It Until It Breaks,"I'm tired of havin' all these troubles, think I've had enough
Excuse me for sayin', but baby I'm callin' your bluff

There's been too many times, too many reasons
Too much cryin' out loud
Too much bein' just another face in your crowd

Oh, and I've heard it before time and time again
You say it's the last time but it never ends
How much more can this poor heart take
You bend it until it breaks

There's been too many cards, too many letters
Strangers sending flowers
Too much worry, and stayin' up lately for hours

It's plain to see you don't care about me
You spread it all around
I'm tired of bein' the joke and the talk of the town

Oh, and I've heard it before time and time again
You say it's the last time but it never ends
How much more can this poor heart take
You bend it until it breaks

Oh, and I've heard it before time and time again
You say it's the last time but it never ends
How much more can this poor heart take
You bend it until it breaks"
John Anderson,Long Black Veil,"Ten years ago on a cold dark night
Someone was killed 'neath the town hall lights
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
That the slayer who ran, looked a lot like me

Now she walks these hills, in a long black veil
She visits my grave, when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows, but me

The scaffold is high, and eternity's near
She stood in the crowd, and shed not a tear
But some times at night, when the cold wind moans
In a long black veil, she cries over my bones

Now she walks these hills, in a long black veil
She visits my grave, when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows, but me

The judge said son, what is your alibi
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die
I spoke not a word, though it meant my life
I'd been in the arms of my best friends wife

Now she walks these hills, in a long black veil
She visits my grave, when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows, but me
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows, but me"
John Anderson,Tuesday I’ll Be Gone,"[Verse 1: John Anderson, Blake Shelton & Both]
Sometimes a man just needs to be alone
Drive the Blue Ridge Parkway to the sky
I don't know where I'm goin'
There ain't no way of knowin'
Trying to forget the reasons why

[Chorus: Both & John Anderson]
Tuesday, I'll be gone
It's time for movin' on
My road to happiness, it might be long, but
Tuesday, I'll be gone

[Verse 2: Blake Shelton, John Anderson & Both]
Take a ride down a road out in the country
And drive the long way around
It don't matter which way or what direction
Long as I am freedom bound

[Chorus: Both, John Anderson & Blake Shelton]
Yeah, Tuesday, I'll be gone
It's time for movin' on
Gonna find my way somehow
Gonna ride to the edge of sundown
Find a place in some small town
To lay my head down

[Outro: John Anderson, Blake Shelton & Both]
My road to happiness, it might be long
My road to happiness, it might be long, but
Tuesday, I'll be gone
Tuesday, I'll be gone"
John Anderson,I’ve Got It Made,"A high dollar woman in a low cut dress
God never wanted me to have a woman like that I guess
A forty room mansion sitting high on a hill
I ain't ever lived in a place like that and I never will

But I've got the mornin' sun, I've got the evenin' breeze
I got the woman that I love lyin' close to me
I've got a few good friends and all my bills are paid
I got the moon and stars above and I've got it made

I don't need a gold mine or a long limousine
I'm not the kind of man to surrender my soul to material things
Just give me a cane pole and a shady spot to sit
To me that's about as close to heaven as a man can get

But I've got the mornin' sun, I've got the evenin' breeze
I got the woman that I love lyin' close to me
I've got a few good friends and all my bills are paid
I got the moon and stars above and I've got it made

I've got a few good friends and all my bills are paid
I got the moon and stars above and I've got it made
I got the moon and stars above and I've got it made"
John Anderson,Would You Catch a Falling Star,"[Verse 1]
You know the crowd was very small
For a country music show
But he faked a curtain call
Just like it was years ago
And then a lady grabbed his arm
As he staggered down the aisle
And with all his country charm
He addressed her with a smile

[Chorus]
Would you catch a fallen star
Before he crashes to the ground
Don't you know how people are
Nobody loves you when you're down
Pick me up and take him home
And I'll bring his old guitar
Sing a golden oldie song
If you'll catch a fallen star

[Verse 2]
He had a silver plated bus
And a million country fans
Now there's just a few of us
And he drives a little van
And they were beatin' down his door
The lovely women left and right
And now he's on the hardwood floor
A wonderin' where he'll spend the night

[Chorus]
Would you catch a fallen star
Before he crashes to the ground
Don't you know how people are
Nobody loves you when you're down
Pick him up and take him home
And he'll bring his old guitar
Sing a golden oldie song
If you'll catch a fallen star

[Coda]
Sing a golden country song
If you'll catch a fallen star"
John Anderson,Let Go of the Stone,"You shouldn't wade out in deep water
When you don't know how to swim
He told you it was over
And like a fool you followed him
Into a whirlpool of emotion
Spinning out of control
It's killing you, but you won't let him go

Let go of the stone
If you don't want to drown
In the sea of heartache
That's draggin' you down
It's pulling you under
And you keep hangin' on
If I'm ever gonna save you
Let go ot the stone

Oh don't you realize the danger
And the hurt you're headed for
Put your arms around me
And swim with me to shore
Just let go of theat ol' mem'ry
I know it's hard to do
But I'll be here
Holdin' on to you

Let go of the stone
If you don't want to drown
In the sea of heartache
That's draggin' you down
It's pulling you under
And you keep hangin' on
If I'm ever gonna save you
Let go ot the stone"
John Anderson,Brown Liquor,"When I drink brown liquor, I get crazy quicker
Than an old red fox on the run
I get tongue tied and I lose my mind
And everything comes undone

It's hard to explain how it bends my brain
When it's a-swimming in my blood

When I drink brown liquor, I go crazy quicker
Than an old red fox on the run, run, run

I can chug a lug on a big beer mug
I can win the blue ribbon every time
On rum and coke, I tell real good jokes
And I hardly ever cross that line

I can shoot tequila till all I feel-a
Is one big happy buzz
But if you see me starting on the Jim or the Jack
Or the [Incomprehensible] then you better run

'Cause when I drink brown liquor, I go crazy quicker
Than an old red fox on the run
I get tongue tied and I lose my mind
And everything comes undone

It's hard to explain how it bends my brain
When it's a-swimming in my blood
When I drink brown liquor, I go crazy quicker
Than an old red fox on the run, run, run

I'm a pretty good guy most Saturday night
Sitting back and sipping on [Incomprehensible]
And I do just fine on homemade wine
And I never think of shooting my gun

Yeah, I'm A okay when the band is playing
Pop a top again
But when I start to slurp that devil in a jug
That's when my trouble begins

'Cause when I drink brown liquor, I go crazy quicker
Than an old red fox on the run
I get tongue tied and I lose my mind
And everything comes undone

It's hard to explain how it bends my brain
When it's a-swimming in my blood
When I drink brown liquor, I go crazy quicker
Than an old red fox on the run, run, run

When I drink brown liquor, I get crazy quicker
Than an old red fox on the run
I get tongue tied and I lose my mind
And everything comes undone

It's hard to explain how it bends my brain
When it's a-swimming in my blood
When I drink brown liquor, I get crazy quicker
Than an old red fox on the run
When I drink brown liquor, I get crazy quicker
Than an old red fox on the run, run, run"

I walked over to her house and this was goin' on
Her brother was on the sofa, eatin' chocolate pie
Her mama was in the kitchen, cuttin' chicken up to fry
Daddy was in the backyard. rollin' up a garden hose
I was on the porch with Charlotte, feelin' love down to my toes

There's a little girl-girl-girl-girl-girl

[Verse 3: John Anderson]
Now, Charlotte, she's a darlin', she's the apple of my eye

John Anderson,Burnin’ Up the Road,"I Got a long distance call from Louisiana
She said, ""oooohwee baby, wanna see my man""
I Can't wait another day
I said, ""Hold on honey, I'm on my way""

It's 500 miles
From Dallas to New Orleans
Gonna let her roll just as fast as she'll go
I got a sweet thing waiting for me
This time I'll be highway flyin'
No way I'm gonna take it slow
She's my heart's desire
I got wheels of fire
I'm burnin' up the road

All the way to Baton Rouge
Well, I'm smokin' these tires like a crazy fool
Barrelin' down the interstate
Runnin' wild, attemptin' fate

It's 500 miles
From Dallas to New Orleans
Gonna let her roll just as fast as she'll go
I got a sweet thing waiting for me
This time I'll be highway flyin'
No way I'm gonna take it slow
She's my heart's desire
I got wheels of fire
I'm burnin' up the road

Engine's overheatin', but I ain't gonna stop
Well she only lives a few more blocks
Blood's pumpin' fast, and radiator's hissin'
I can almost feel the huggin' and kissin'

It's 500 miles
From Dallas to New Orleans
Gonna let her roll just as fast as she'll go
I got a sweet thing waiting for me
This time I'll be highway flyin'
No way I'm gonna take it slow

Faron Young,It’s Four In The Morning,"[Verse 1]
It's four in the morning and once more the dawning
Just woke up the wanting in me
Wishing I'd never met her, knowing if I'd forget her
How much better off she would be

[Chorus]
The longer I hold on and the longer this goes on
The harder that it's gonna be
But it's four in the morning and once more the dawning
Just woke up the wanting in me

[Verse 2]
I've never deserved her, God knows when I hurt her
That's the last thing that I want to do
She tries but she can't tell how she feels
But I know too well what she's going through

[Chorus]
If I love her so much I don't know why I can't do
The right thing and just let her be
But it's four in the morning and once more the dawning
Just woke up the wanting in me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Last night I told her this time it's all over
Making ten times I've told her goodbye
Last night we broke up, this morning I woke up
And for the tenth time, I'm changing my mind

[Chorus]
I saw more love in her eyes when I left her
Than most foolish men will ever see
And it's four in the morning and once more the dawning
Just woke up the wanting in me

[Outro]
It's four in the morning and once more the dawning
Just woke up the wanting in me
Wishing I'd never met her, knowing if I'd forget her
How much better off she would be..."
Faron Young,Hello Walls,"(Hello, hello)
Hello walls (hello, hello), how'd things go for you today?
Don't you miss her since she upped and walked away?
And I'll bet you dread to spend another lonely night with me
But lonely walls, I'll keep you company

Hello window (hello hello), well I see that you're still here
Aren't you lonely since our darling disappeared?
Well, look here, is that a teardrop in the corner of your pane?
Now don't you try to tell me that it's rain

She went away and left us all alone, the way she planned
Yes, we'll have to learn to get along without her if we can

Hello ceiling (hello hello), I'm gonna stare at you awhile
You know I can't sleep, so won't you bear with me awhile?
We must all stick together or else I'll lose my mind
I've got a feeling she'll be gone a long, long time
(hello, hello)..."
Faron Young,The Ballad Of Paladin,"Have gun will travel reads the card of a man
A knight without armor in a savage land
His fast gun for hire heeds the calling wind
A soldier of fortune is a man called Paladin
Paladin Paladin where do you roam Paladin Paladin far far from home

He travels on to wherever he must
A chess knight of silver is his badge of trust
There are campfire legends that the plainsmen spin
Of a man with the gun of the man called Paladin
Paladin Paladin where do you roam Paladin Paladin far far from home
Far far from home far far from home"
Faron Young,Wine Me Up,"I'm the center of attention in this barroom
Cause I've got a biggest heartache of the year
And each night those swinging doors reach out for me and draw me in
'Cause they know each night that I'll come back to wine me up again

Wine me up, turn me on and watch me cry for you
Lately drinking warm red wine is all I want to do
And I never know how tight I'll wine me up till I walk in
But I don't care cause I'll be back to wine me up again

I'd like to thank the men that raise the grapes way out in California
And I'm hoping this will be their biggest year
'Cause scarlet water's all that's left to keep me hanging on
And that's why I'll try to wine me up each day and night next year

Wine me up turn me on and watch me cry for you
Lately drinking warm red wine is all I want to do
And I never know how tight I'll wine me up till I walk in
But I don't care cause I'll be back to wine me up again..."
Faron Young,"Seasons Come, Seasons Go","The seasons come, the seasons go
We get a little sunshine, rain or snow
Just the way that it was planned to be

But there's no seasons in my heart
While you play the leading part
'Cause the flowers will bloom eternally

Your leaving will bring autumn sorrow
And my tears, like withered leaves will fall
But spring could bring some glad tomorrow
And darling, we could be happy after all

As it's all is in nature's plan
No season gets the upper hand
Oh, how I try to keep this fact in mind

The trees are bare, the cold wind blows
And by experience I know
That winter comes but spring is close behind

Your leaving will bring autumn sorrow
And my tears like withered leaves will fall
But spring could bring some glad tomorrow
And darling, we could be happy after all"
Faron Young,"Live Fast, Love Hard, Die Young","[Intro]
I wanna live fast, love hard, die young
And leave a beautiful memory

[Verse 1]
I wanna live fast, love hard, die young
And leave a beautiful memory
Don't want slow walkin' or sad singin'
Let 'em have a jubilee

[Chorus]
I wanna leave a lot of happy women
Thinking pretty thoughts of me
I wanna live fast, love hard, die young
And leave a beautiful memory

[Bridge]
I got a hot-rod car and a cowboy suit
And I really do get around
I got a little black book and the gals look cute
And I know the name of every spot in town

[Chorus]
I wanna find 'em, fool 'em, leave 'em
And let 'em do the same to me
I wanna live fast, love hard, die young
And leave a beautiful memory

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
I wanna live fast, love hard, die young
And leave a beautiful memory
I'm a Wampus cat, let me grab my hat
And baby, come along with me

[Chorus]
We're gonna do some fancy stepping
We're really goin' on a spree
I wanna live fast, love hard, die young
And leave a beautiful memory

[Bridge]
Now you may not approve of the things I do
But it really don't bother me
But don't ever think you can tie me down
I'm gonna stay footloose and fancy free

[Chorus]
So jump back, make tracks, move out
And let the pretty gals at me
I wanna live fast, love hard, die young
And leave a beautiful memory"
Faron Young,Here I Am In Dallas,"Here I am in Dallas where in the hell are you
I came here to meet you like I said I'd do
Have cowboy hats and pickup trucks made a fool of you
Here I am in Dallas where in the hell are you

Said goodbye to all my friends down at Tootsie's bar
I packed up my old suitcase and I threw it in the car
Canceled my subscription to the Music City News
'Cause you made me an offer honey I could not refuse

Here I am in Dallas woman where are you
I came here to meet you like I said I'd do
Have cowboy hats and pickup trucks made a fool of you
Here I am in Dallas woman where are you

Walked into a barroom and I laid the picture down
I asked the guy behind the bar if he'd seen you around
He said he'd didn't know the name but he's seen that face before
And I swear I heard him laughing as I walked out the door

What got me here to Dallas sure has got me down
There's something here in Dallas turned your head around
When I came here I brought my pride and just like you it's gone
And without my pride and you I can't go back home
Here I am in Dallas where in the hell are you"
Faron Young,Alone With You,"[Verse 1]
How I'd love to be around you
When the lonely night surrounds you
How I'd love to be alone with you
What I'd give to have the power
To read your mind one hour
How I'd love to be alone with you

[Chorus]
Just to be with you one night
You and me alone
Kiss your lips and hold you tight
Have you for my own

[Post-Chorus]
This would be a joy unending
Could be a real beginning
How I'd love to be alone with you

[Verse 2]
How I'd love to be around you
When the lonely night surrounds you
How I'd love to be alone with you
If I only knew for certain
I'd cut out all my flirting
How I'd love to be alone with you

[Chorus]
Just to be with you one night
You and me alone
Kiss your lips and hold you tight
Have you for my own

[Post-Chorus]
Won't you try to be my baby
Just for once and then well maybe
I could always be alone with you
Won't you try to be my baby
Just for once and then well maybe
I could always be alone with you
And I could always be alone with you"
Faron Young,Occasional Wife,"If our life is worth living together then why let it go
If our love's worth saving it needs some attention to grow
It needs more than just an occasional piece of your life
A home just can't stand when it has an occasional wife

The name of the game you're playing must be
See how far you can go
But can't you see what it's doing to me
And the world we both used to know

If our life is worth living together then why let it go
If our love's worth saving it needs some attention to grow
It needs more than just an occasional piece of you life
A home just can't stand when it has an occasional wife
A home just can't stand when it has an occasional wife"
Faron Young,The Yellow Bandana,"This is the story of the Yellow Bandana
A handsome young soldier and the girl named Rosana

Oh, way down west in the winds on New Mexico
There lived a girl and the soldier who loved her so
And every night neath the full crimson moon above
This brave young soldier would pledge her his love

And he gave Rosana his yellow bandana
To wear in her hair till he's with her once more
He gave Rosana his yellow bandana
Mounted his pony and rode off to war

His orders came and he had to ride west again
Seems that Apaches were causing unrest again
He kissed Rosana goodbye as he rode away
Promising this time he'd come back to stay

And he gave Rosana his yellow bandana
To wear in her hair till he's with her once more
He gave Rosana his yellow bandana
Mounted his pony and rode off to war

That war was over and he came back home and found
That the Apaches had burned the whole village down
And neath the tree where he'd last kissed Rosana
Gripped on the cross was his yellow bandana

And he gave Rosana his yellow bandana
To wear in her hair till he's with her once more
He gave Rosana his yellow bandana
Mounted his pony and rode off to war

He gave Rosana his yellow bandana
To wear in her hair till he's with her once more
He gave Rosana his yellow bandana
Mounted his pony and rode off to war...."
Faron Young,I Can’t Wait (For The Sun To Go Down),"I can't wait for the sun to go down to get you under the moon
I wanna whisper something in your ear while we cuddle and spoon
I wanna tell you all the things I plan it can't be too soon
I can't wait for the sun to go down to get you under the moon

Lay your head upon my shoulder while I hold you in my arms
Promise me all my dreams will come true in June
I can't wait for the sun to go down to get you under the moon

I can't wait to get you all alone I want you all to myself
Darling while I'm holding you close you put the world on a shelf
I don't want nobody but you when it's time to spoon
I can't wait for the sun to go down to get you under the moon"
Faron Young,Walk Tall (Walk Straight),"(Walk tall)

Walk tall, walk straight and look the world right in the eye
That's what my mama told me when I was about knee high
She said son, be a proud man and hold your head up high
Walk tall, walk straight and look the world right in the eye

All through the years that I grew up, ma taught these things to me
But I was young and foolish then and much too blind to see
I ignored the things she said as if I'd never heard
Now I see and understand the wisdom of her words

Walk tall, walk straight and look the world right in the eye
That's what my mama told me when I was about knee high
She said, son, be a proud man and hold your head up high
Walk tall, walk straight and look the world right in the eye

I started goin' places where the youngsters shouldn't go
I got to know the kind of girls it's better not to know
I fell in with a bad crowd and laughed and drank with them
Through the laughter mama's words would echo now and then

Walk tall, walk straight and look the world right in the eye
That's what my mama told me when I was about knee high
She said, son, be a proud man and hold your head up high
Walk tall, walk straight and look the world right in the eye

I got in trouble with the law and I'm in prison now
Through these prison bars I see things so much different now
I've got one year left to serve and when my time is done
I'll walk tall and straight and make ma proud to call me son

Walk tall, walk straight and look the world right in the eye
That's what my mama told me when I was about knee high
She said, son, be a proud man and hold your head up high
Walk tall, walk straight and look the world right in the eye
Walk tall, walk straight and look the world right in the eye
Walk tall

Faron Young,Goin’ Steady,"Well, me and my baby are goin' steady
We ain't married but we're gettin' ready
To tie the knot and I'm gonna make her my own
Now that I've found her I'm gonna keep her
Finders keepers, losers weepers
She's my baby she's goin' steady with me

Well, I've been honky tonkin' round nearly all my life
But now I got a steady babe and I'm gonna make her my wife
All you rovin' ramblers can leave her alone
Don't even try to date her on the phone
'Cause she's my baby, she's goin' steady with me

Well, now sweet baby that we're goin' steady
I'll pull up and ask your daddy
What he thinks if you and I are wed
'Cause I love you and you love me
We're both as happy as can be
And I hope your daddy will let you go steady with me

Well, we'll get the rings and be on our way
To see the preacher man
And when you say I do sweetheart
I'll slip the ring on your loving hand
Everything's gonna turn out fine
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
'Cause you're my baby, you're goin' steady with me..."
Faron Young,Country Girl,"I met you, my country girl
You didn't have a thing
I fell in love, I dressed you up
Then I bought the ring

I was teaching you to love
You were learning fine
Then one day, you learned too much
And it poisoned your sweet mind

Now you've gone and left me
You're with somebody new
But I wonder if you told him
I bought the clothes on you

When you two are dancin'
And you whisper soft and sweet
I wonder if you tell him
I bought the shoes on your feet

Now I've lost my country girl
To a city love affair
He'd built you up, you fell for him
You didn't treat me fair

You think that he's a dream come true
He says he loves you so
But wait until the word gets out
I taught you all that you know

Now you've gone and left me
You're with somebody new
But I wonder if you told him
I bought the clothes on you

When you two are dancin'
And you whisper soft and sweet
I wonder if you'll tell him
I bought the shoes on your feet..."
Faron Young,That’s the Way I Feel,"Did you ever feel unwanted
Kicked around so much you're taunted
Heart cries out with so much pain
Well that's the way I feel

I loved someone and loved her dearly
Spoke sweet words, she didn't hear me
Left me here heart-sick and lonely
That's The Way I Feel

To cry would do no good
I used to think it would
But the more I cried
The more I believed here's what I'll do
I'll let this feeling have it's day
Maybe it will go away
Maybe I will find another
That's the way I feel

I can't let heartache overcome me
Just because of the way she done me
I'll forget I ever loved her, that's the way I feel

To cry would do no good
I used to think it would
But the more I cried
The more I believed here's what I'll do
I'll let this feeling have it's day
Maybe it will go away
Maybe I will find another
That's the way I feel

I can't let heartache overcome me
Just because of the way she done me
I'll forget I ever loved her, that's the way I feel
I'll forget I ever loved her, that's the way I feel
Oh I hope I will forgive her, that's the way I feel"
Faron Young,You’re Still Mine,"[Verse 1]
You're still mine each moment you're away
You're still mine, don't forget it for a day
Just go on and have yourself a time
Just as long as you remember you're still mine

[Chorus]
Don't you know how much I miss ya
'Cause I never could resist ya
And I'm sure while you're away
You'll have lotsa chances
At finding new romances
But remember what I have to say

[Verse 2]
See your friends and have yourself a ball
Dance and sing, won't bother me at all
But don't fall for anybody's line
And remember when they hold you, you're still mine

And remember when they hold you, you're still mine"
Faron Young,Just What I Had in Mind,"I come home at the end of the day
And find her waiting and she knows how to help me unwind
When her arms reach for me I know she's anticipating
Just what I had in mind

Just what I had in mind
Just what I always have hoped I would find
All my life I've looked around
Oh but I've finally found
Just what I had in mind

Many times in the night she will ask how much I love her
And I'll say 'til the end of all time
And she smiles 'cause she knows lying there beneath the cover
Is just what I had in mind

Just what I had in mind
Just what I always have hoped I would find
All my life I've looked around
Oh but I've finally found
Just what I had in mind"
Faron Young,If You Ain’t Lovin’ (You Ain’t Livin’),"If you got a Cadillac boy
And a forty room shack boy
A bucket full of money
And a tree full of honey

But if you get no huggin'
No smoochin' or muggin'
Well, if you ain't lovin'
Then you ain't livin'

If you're ridin' on the gravy train
Instead of walkin' down lovers lane
You can't make hay boy
You're goin' the wrong way boy

You gotta get a little honey
It's better than money
Well, if you ain't lovin'
Then you ain't livin'

If they call you a big man
'Cause you got a lot of bottom land
If you're kin to the president
And if you help run the government

But if you get no attention
You better off on a pension
For if you ain't lovin'
Then you ain't livin'

If you got a string of long cars
And you're smoking them four-bit cigars
You ain't so well to do
Unless you get a little choochy coo

It takes a little of smackin'
Or your life is a lackin'
Well, if you ain't lovin'
Well, brother then you ain't livin'..."
Faron Young,I’m So in Love With You,"I always tried to tell myself that you don't make me blue
I lay and cry and still deny the fickle things you do
I oughta run so far away I'll never see the light of day
I oughta go but I gotta stay with you cause I'm so in love with you
All my friends are telling me you're breaking up our home
They say that I should say goodbye and leave you all alone
But there ain't nobody telling me a doggone thing that I can see
I oughta go but I gotta be with you cause I'm so in love with you

I guess you really got me hooked you know I'm really gone
You wake and sigh and smile and lie and string me right along
Your fickle heart will break my home I know you reap the things you sown
But I just can't leave the love I've known with you cause I'm so in love with you
I know that you've been stepping out and swinging high and wide
You made the rounds all over town you didn't tried to hide
You're gonna pay I have no doubt your sin will surely find you out
I oughta laugh when it's turned about with you but I'm so in love with you"
Faron Young,That’s The Way It’s Gotta Be,"Are there any memories you're keeping in your heart
Could there be an old old flame that might keep us apart

Well there can be no other love that is if you want me

And that's the way it's gotta be

Arms that love one woman that's how it is with me

You tell me that you're so in love but is it all with me

I remember when you said that you were mine alone

Still I can't convince my heart that you're my very own

And if I find you've been untrue you've seen the last of me

And that's the way it's gotta be

And that's the way it's gotta be"
Faron Young,It’s A Great Life (If You Don’t Weaken),"Well it's a great life if you don't weaken but who wants to be strong

Well I don't guess I'll ever make a million I just want enough to get by
Like a checking the town in two or three banks and a yellow Cadillac to drive
To go sportin' around with two or three red-heads or maybe take a blonde along
It's a great life if you don't weaken but who wants to be strong

Just give me my money and cold hard pension give my guitar in tune
And get me a date with a pretty little thing and I'll be markin' afternoon
No want more than anybody else just takes more for me to get along
It's a great life if you don't weaken but who wants to be strong

It's a simple thing in life that really matter and I'm a pretty simple guy
Just give me a house a swimming pool and a little sport plane to fly
It don't take much to satisfy me I'm a country boy tryin' to get along
It's a great life if you don't weaken but who wants to be strong"
Faron Young,Beautiful Garden of Prayer,"There's a garden where Jesus is waiting
There's a place that is wondrously fair
For it glows with the light of His presence
Tis the beautiful garden of prayer

Oh the beautiful garden the garden of prayer
Oh the beautiful garden of prayer
There my Savior awaits and He opens the gates
To the beautiful garden of prayer

Oh the beautiful garden the garden of prayer
Oh the beautiful garden of prayer
There my Savior awaits and He opens the gates
To the beautiful garden of prayer"
Faron Young,I Miss You Already (And You’re Not Even Gone),"I miss you already and you're not even gone
The time has come you're telling me goodbye and I know I can keep you if I try
I've had too many chances now I'll have to set you free
I watch you go too late I know how much you mean to me
I miss you already I don't know how I'll go on
I miss you already and you're not even gone
( fiddle - steel )
So kiss me once again and please don't cry I'll promise there'll be no more alibis
I'll have to find myself a way to face this loneliness
I was untrue mistreated you I've lost my happiness
I miss you already..."
Faron Young,Face To The Wall,"Was I farther from your conscience standing face to the wall
I suspected there was something that you weren't telling me
And last night I learned the reason for it all
I was looking through your window saw you kissing someone else
You reached up and turned my picture slowly face to the wall
Face to the wall so you wouldn't have to see anything at all to make you think of me
Did the cheapness of the moment make you feel ashamed and small
Was I farther from your conscience standing face to the wall

Alone out in the darkness were the eyes that worshipped you
As you cheated me I watched my idle fall
With your arms around another and his lips where mine should be
Then I saw you turned my picture slowly face to the wall
Face to the wall..."
Faron Young,Sweet Dreams,"[Verse 1]
Sweet dreams of you
Every night I go through
Why can't I forget you and start my life anew?
Instead of having sweet dreams about you

[Verse 2]
You don't love me it's plain
I should know you'll never wear my name
I should hate you the whole night through
Instead of having sweet dreams about you

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Sweet dreams of you
Dreams I know can't come true
Why can't I forget the past, start loving someone new?
Instead of having sweet dreams about you

You don't love me it's plain
I should know you'll never wear my name
I should hate you the whole night through
Instead of having sweet dreams about you"
Ricky Skaggs,Honey (Open That Door),"Honey, Honey
Honey won't you open that door
This is your sweet daddy don't you love me no more?
It's cold outside let me sleep on the floor
Honey won't you open that door

I honky-tonked around Dallas
Got in a poker game
Somebody must've been a-cheatin'
I lost everything but my name
Well I walked halfway to memphis
Finally got back home
I'd have been better off where i was
'cause here's where things went wrong

Honey, Honey
Honey won't you open that door
This is your sweet daddy don't you love me no more?
It's cold outside let me sleep on the floor
Honey won't you open that door

I went downtown to see 'ol bob
Thought he was my friend
The landlord said that bob's not here
""The Police done hauled him in!""
I ran right back to little honey's house
I got me a rockin' chair
""now honey if you don't open that door
I'm gonna rock on away from here""
Honey, Honey
Honey won't you open that door
This is your sweet daddy don't you love me no more?

Ricky Skaggs,Bury Me Beneath the Weeping Willow Tree,"Oh, bury me beneath the willow
Under the weeping willow tree
So she will know where I am sleeping
And perhaps she'll weep for me

My heart is sad I am lonely
For the only one I love
When shall I see her oh no never
'Til we meet in heaven above

She told me that she dearly loved me
How could I believe it untrue
Until the angels softly whispered
She will prove untrue to you

Tomorrow was to be our wedding
God oh God where can she be
She's out a courting with another
And no longer cares for me..."
Ricky Skaggs,Simple Life,"I live a simple life
I work all day I sleep all night
A couple kids that need a nap
Big dog and a little cat
Wife that barks but rarely bites
So I live the simple life

I live a simple life
A good coat when the cold winds bite
Leather boots for my bare feet
Now and then a steak to eat
I pick with the boys on Friday night
So I live a simple life

My favorite book was wrote about
A man that died to save my soul
And my favorite thing to hear is
Daddy, I'm so glad you home
And my favorite woman is 5'3""
With long black hair and green eyes
Still I live a simple life

I live a simple life
Couple of friends I really like
A little house outside of town
An old car that gets me around
Complications may arise
But I live a simple life

And I live a simple life
Cell phone when my old car dies
The Internet to show me where
GPS to get me there
Everywhere there's satellites
Oh, I live a simple life

My favorite book was wrote about
A man that died to save my soul
And my favorite thing to hear is
Daddy, I'm so glad you home
And my favorite woman is 5'3""
With long black hair and green eyes
Still I live a simple life"
Ricky Skaggs,Uncle Pen,"Oh, the people would come from far away
To dance all night to the break of day
When the caller would holler: ""Do Si Do""
They knew Uncle Pen was ready to go

Late in the evening, about sundown
High on the hill, an' above the town
Uncle Pen played the fiddle, Lord, how it rang
You could hear it talk, you could hear it sing!

Well, he played an old tune they called the ""Soldier's Joy""
And he played the one they called the ""Boston Boy""
Greatest of all was the ""Jennie Lynn""
To me, that's where the fiddlin' begins

Late in the evening, about sundown
High on the hill, an' above the town
Uncle Pen played the fiddle, Lord, how it rang
You could hear it talk, you could hear it sing!

I'll never forget that mournful day
When old Uncle Pen was called away
He hung up his fiddle and he hung up his bow
And he knew it was time for him to go

Late in the evening, about sundown
High on the hill, an' above the town
Uncle Pen played the fiddle, Lord, how it rang
You could hear it talk, you could hear it sing!

Late in the evening, about sundown
High on the hill, an' above the town
Uncle Pen played the fiddle, Lord, how it rang
You could hear it talk, you could hear it sing!..."
Ricky Skaggs,Highway 40 Blues,"Well, these Highway Forty blues
I've walked holes in both my shoes
Counted the days since I've been gone
And I'd love to see the lights of home

Wasted time and money too;
Squandered youth in search of truth
But in the end I had to lose
Lord above, I've paid my dues
Got the Highway Forty blues

The highway called when I was young
Told me lies of things to come
Fame and fortune lies ahead!
That's what the billboard lights had said

Shattered dreams, my mind is numb
My money's gone, stick out my thumb
My eyes are filled with bitter tears
Lord, I ain't been home in years
Got the Highway Forty blues

You know, I've rambled all around
Like a rolling stone, from town to town
Met pretty girls I have to say
But none of them could make me stay

Well, I've played the music halls and bars
Had fancy clothes and big fine cars:
Things a country boy can't use
Dixieland I sure miss you
Got the Highway Forty blues..."
Ricky Skaggs,Baby I’m in Love With You,"Baby, I'm in love with you drownin' in your eyes so blue
Tell me that you love me too I'm just gonna be with you
Come and let me hold you hand till I make you understand
I'm just gonna be your man baby I'm in love with you

I'm forever building dreams around your pretty head it seems
Do you want to spoil my dreams and say that you'll ever be mine
I would take an ocean trip just again to hear your sweet lips
I would walk a million miles to hear you say you love me too

I'm forever building dreams around your pretty head it seems
Do you want to spoil my dreams and say that you'll ever be mine
I would take an ocean trip just again to hear your sweet lips
I would walk a million miles to hear you say you love me too

I'll be yours for evermore baby I'm in love with you"
Ricky Skaggs,Don’t Get Above Your Raisin’,"Now I got a gal that's sweet to me
She just ain't what she used to be
Just a little high headed
Thats plain to see

Don't get above your raising
Stay down on earth with me
Now looky here gal don't you high hat me
I ain't forgot what you used to be

When you didn't have nothing
That was plain to see
Don't get above your raising
Stay down on earth with me

Now you need not hold your head so high
Every time you pass me by
For it don't mean nothing
To me you see

Don't get above your raising
Stay sown on earth with me
Now looky here gal you better be yourself
And leave that other stuff on the shelf

You're country baby
That's plain to see
Don't get above your raising
Stay down on earth with me

Now I got a gal that's sweet to me
She just ain't what she used to be
Just a little high headed
Thats plain to see

Don't get above your raising
Stay down on earth with me..."
Ricky Skaggs,Country Boy,"[Verse 1]
I may look like a city slicker
Shinin' up through his shoes
Underneath, I'm just a cotton picker
Pickin' out a mess of blues

[Chorus]
Show me where I start
Find a horse and cart
I'm just a country boy
Country boy at heart

[Verse 2]
I may look like a bank teller
Pushing facts in a file
But I'd rather be a hog caller
Chewing cud on the sty

[Chorus]
Show me where I start
Find a horse and cart
I'm just a country boy
Country boy at heart

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 1]
I may look like a city slicker
Shinin' up through his shoes
Underneath, I'm just a cotton picker
Pickin' out a mess of blues

[Chorus]
Show me where I start
Find a horse and cart
I'm just a country boy
Country boy at heart"
Ricky Skaggs,Your Old Love Letters,"Today, I burned your old love letters;
I burned them gently, one by one
And as I light the flame, I'd read it
So I could see what you had done

The first you wrote me was the sweetest:
The last one broke my heart in two
Our love now lies among the embers
In the ashes of your letters tied in blue

And as I burned your old love letters
It brought back mem'ries from the past
It told about you and your new love
A love I knew could never last

The first you wrote me was the sweetest:
The last one broke my heart in two
And as I light the flame, I'd read it
For I can say: ""I still love you."""
Ricky Skaggs,Children go,"Children go where I send thee (Oh Lordy)
How will I send thee
Oh, I'm gonna send thee one by one
One for the little bitty baby
That was born, born, born
In Bethlehem

Children go where I send thee (Oh Lordy)
How will I send thee
Oh, I'm gonna send thee two by two
For Paul and Silas
One for the little bitty baby
That was born, born, born
In Bethlehem

Three was the Hebrew children
Four was the four that stood at the door
Five was the five that came back alive
Six was the six that didn't get picked
Seven was the seven that never got to heaven
Eight was the eight that waited at the gate
Nine was the nine that stood in the line
Ten for the ten commandments..."
Ricky Skaggs,I’ll Take the Blame,"You say I've done you wrong
I've wrecked the happy home
We've tried so many times, we both know when
Let's take another chance
To renew an old romance
And if we love each other, time will tell

Oh, I know, dear, what it means to live without you
These lonely nights are drivin' me insane
But before I'll hurt the one I love so dearly
When people ask what's wrong, I'll take the blame

Well, I know, dear, what it means to live without you
These lonely nights are drivin' me insane
But before I'll hurt the one I love so dearly
When people ask what's wrong, I'll take the blame

Yes, when people ask what's wrong, I'll take the blame"
Ricky Skaggs,Won’t It Be Wonderful There?,"When with the Savior we enter the glory land
Won't it be wonderful there
Ended the troubles and cares of the story land
Won't it be wonderful there

Won't it be wonderful there
Having no burdens to bear
Joyously singing with heart-bells a-ringing
Won't it be wonderful there

Walking and talking with Christ the Supernal One
Won't it be wonderful there
Praising adoring the matchless Eternal One
Won't it be wonderful there

Won't it be wonderful there
Having no burdens to bear
Joyously singing with heart-bells a-ringing
Won't it be wonderful there

There where the tempest will never be sweeping us
Won't it be wonderful there
Sure that forever the Lord will be keeping us
Won't it be wonderful there

Won't it be wonderful there
Having no burdens to bear
Joyously singing with heart-bells a-ringing
Won't it be wonderful there"
Ricky Skaggs,Heartbroke,"[Verse 1]
Well, who wouldn't notice the fire in your eyes
Or the bitter direction of impending goodbyes?
I'm fallin', I'm folded, I'm wilted in place
At the sight of you standin' with streaks down your face

[Chorus]
You got your heartbroke, you go runnin' from the reason
Get your heartbroke, don't give up on believin' in me
Heartbroke, who kept me from leavin' with my heart broke?

[Verse 2]
Well, cryin' when you're rich is a bore, if you're lonely
Sheer madness prevails upon reason to yield
But all is not lost, it is only mistaken
A small consolation but I know just how you feel

[Chorus]
You got your heartbroke, go runnin' from the reason
Got your heartbroke, don't give up on believin' in me
Heartbroke, who kept me from leavin' with my heartbroke?

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Well nobody said it was goin' to be easy
We all have our weak sides that need a soft, good touch
Nobody said that it would not be worth it
But human conditions continues as such

[Chorus]
You got your heartbroke, you go runnin' from the reason
Got your heartbroke, don't give up on believin' in me
Heartbroke, who kept me from leavin' with my heartbroke?

[Outro]
You kept me from leavin' with my heartbroke
With my heartbroke, with my heartbroke
You got your heartbroke"
Ricky Skaggs,I’m Ready to Go,"Hallelujah, I'm ready
I can hear the voices singing soft and low
Hallelujah, I'm ready
Hallelujah, I'm ready to go

In the darkness of night not a star was in sight
On a highway that leads down below
Then Jesus came in and saved my soul from sin
Hallelujah, I'm ready to go

Hallelujah, I'm ready
I can hear the voices singing soft and low
Hallelujah, I'm ready
Hallelujah, I'm ready to go

Sinners don't wait before it's too late
He's a wonderful Saviour you know
Well I fell on my knees when I answered my pleas
Hallelujah, I'm ready to go

Hallelujah, I'm ready
I can hear the voices singing soft and low
Hallelujah, I'm ready
Hallelujah, I'm ready to go

Hallelujah, I'm ready
I can hear the voices singing soft and low

Ricky Skaggs,New Star Shining,"They didn't own a house
No crib, no toys were waiting
Still, they had their love for
The childthey were anticipating

He was born one winter night
On a road between two towns
They wrapped Him up so warm and tight
And said, ""It looks like heaven's come down.""

There was a new star shining in the sky up above
By His light that winter night they found peace and perfect love
If we want to find it, I know we always will
'Cause that new star is shining for us still

They worried how to feed Him
Simple trade was all they knew
It was hard enough to make ends meet
When they were only two

But the cold, the dark, and hunger
Couldn't take away their joy
And they knew that they would find a way
For that precious baby boy

There was a new star shining in the sky up above
By His light that winter night they found peace and perfect love
If we want to find it, I know we always will
'Cause that new star is shining for us still

If we want to find it, I know we always will

Ricky Skaggs,I Wouldn’t Change You If I Could,"I wouldn't change a single thing about you if I could
The way you are just suits me too a tee
A princess in a storybook
A king upon his throne
That's what we are and you belong too me

I wouldn't change you if I could
I love you as you are
You're all that I would wish for
If I wished upon a star
An angel sent from heaven
You're everything that's good
You're perfect just the way you are
I wouldn't change you if I could

Your eyes your lips, your tender smile
I'd leave them as they are
And come what may I'd never change a thing
And if I were a potter
And you a piece of clay
The only thing I'd change would be your name

I wouldn't change you if I could
I love you as you are
You're all that I would wish for
If I wished upon a star
An angel sent from heaven
You're everything that's good
You're perfect just the way you are
I wouldn't change you if I could..."
Ricky Skaggs,I’ll Stay Around,"Now you just told me that you're leaving
On the next train coming down
I love you dear but I won't follow
I just think I'll stay around

For I know someday you'll want me
When your true love can't be found
But if you go dear I won't follow
I just think I'll stay around

You know my dear I'll always love you
And I'd never let you down
But if you go dear I won't follow
I just think I'll stay around

Someday you'll hear that whistle blowing
On the special coming down
You'll be looking for me baby
But I may not be around"
Ricky Skaggs,This World Is Not My Home,"This World is not my Home

Verse 1:
This world is not my home
Im just a passn through
My treasures and my hope
Is placed beyond the blue
Many friends and kindred
Have gone on before
And I can't feel at home
In this world anymore

Heavens expecting me
Thats one thing I know
I fixed it up with Jesus
A long time ago
He will take me through
Though I am weak and poor
And I can't feel at home
In this world anymore

If you get there before me
Ill be there just the same
Youll hear me when I shout
O glory to his name!
Ill fly away with Him
My savior I adore
And I can't feel at home
In this world anymore"
Ricky Skaggs,Somebody’s Prayin’,"Somebody's prayin, I can feel it

Angels are watchin', I can feel it
Angels are watchin' over me
There's many miles ahead 'til I get home
Still I'm safely kept before your thrown
'Cause Lord I believe, Lord I believe
Your angels are watchin' over me

Well, I've walked through barren wilderness
When my pillow was a stone
And I've been through the darkest caverns
Where no light had ever shown
Still I went on 'cause there was someone
Who was down on their knees
And Lord. I thank you for those people
Prayin' all this time for me

Ricky Skaggs,Why Did I Wait So Long?,"God spoke to me a hundred times
He'd call my name, I would not go
Now I cry with joy on bended knees
Could've been this happy long ago
Chorus
Why did I wait so long?
Why did I wait so long?
To answer the call
From the Greatest of all
Why did I wait so long?
God's been with me through troubled times
With hands not seen, He's guided my way
But my foolish pride and worldly things
Kept me from Him until today
Why did I wait so long?
To answer the call
From the greatest of all
Why did I wait so long?"

Ricky Skaggs,River of Jordan,"To the River of Jordan our Savior went one day
And we read that John the Baptist met Him there
And when John baptized Jesus in Jordan's rushing waters
The mighty power of God filled the air

I'm on my way to the River of Jordan
Gonna wade right in to the rushing waters
I'm going down to the River of Jordan
And let the cool waters cleanse my soul

King Naaman was stricken with dreaded leprosy
And he sent for the man of God to pray
But Elisha said to Naaman Go dip yourself in Jordan
And let the cool waters wash your spots away

So he went right down to the River Of Jordan
He waded right in the rushing waters
He dipped himself in the River of Jordan
And the cool waters made him whole

Oh, the River of Jordan is many miles away
And this mighty river I may never see
But I'll find myself an alter in an old fashioned church
And my River of Jordan that will be..."
Ricky Skaggs,Don’t Cheat in Our Hometown,"Tonight my heart is beating low, and my head is bowed
You've been seen with my best friend on the other side of town
I don't mind this waiting, don't mind this running 'round
But if you're gonna cheat on me don't cheat in our home town

How can I stand up to my friends and look 'em in the eye
Admit the question that I know would be nothing but lies
You spend all your past time, making me a clown
But if you're gonna cheat on me, don't cheat in our home town

Now there are no secrets in this little country town
Everyone knows everyone for miles and miles around
Your bright eyes and your sweet smile are driving me insane
You think it's smart to break my heart and tear down my name

How can I stand up to my friends and look 'em in the eye
Admit the question that I know would be nothing but lies
You spend all your past time, making me a clown
But if you're gonna cheat on me, don't cheatin our home town"
Ricky Skaggs,Thanks Again,"I've sent bouquets for Mother's Day
For Father's Day, a shirt and card
While they came from the heart
They all fell short of saying how special you both are

It wasn't ' til I was up and gone
Married with a couple of kids of my own
Doing what mamas and daddies do
That I realized what I must have put you through

So thanks again for the love in the cradle
And all of the changes that kept me dry
And thanks again for the love at our table
And tannin' my bottom when I told you a lie

For takin' me fishin' and flyin' my kites
And tuckin' me in, yes, night after night;
To my beautiful life-long friends
Hey, mom and daddy thanks again

I'm still a young man, least I think I am
But I'm watchin' my own hair turn gray
And your call last Sunday brought to mind
That I owe you a debt I can never repay

So thanks again for worryin' and waitin'
When I started datin' on weekend nights
And thanks again for the help with my homework
And sittin' up with me till I got it right

Your car for the prom, your letters in 'Nam
But most of all, Daddy, for marryin' mom;
To my beautiful life long friends
Hey, Mom and Daddy thanks again

To my beautiful life long friends
Hey, mom and daddy thanks again..."
Kacey Musgraves,Rainbow,"[Verse 1]
When it rains, it pours
But you didn't even notice
It ain't rainin' anymore
It's hard to breathe when all you know is
The struggle of stayin' above the risin' water line

[Chorus]
Well, the sky has finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out in the same ol' storm again
You hold tight to your umbrella
Well, darlin', I'm just tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow
Hangin' over your head

[Verse 2]
If you could see what I see
You'd be blinded by the colors
Yellow, red, and orange, and green
And at least a million others
So tie up the boat, take off your coat
And take a look around

[Chorus]
'Cause the sky has finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out in the same ol' storm again
You hold tight to your umbrella
Well, darlin', I'm just tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow
Hangin' over your head

[Bridge]
Oh, tie up the boat, take off your coat
And take a look around
Everything is alright now

[Chorus]
'Cause the sky has finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out in the same ol' storm again
Let go of your umbrella
'Cause, darlin', I'm just tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow
Hangin' over your head
Yeah, there's always been a rainbow
Hangin' over your head

[Outro]
Mmm
It'll all be alright"
Kacey Musgraves,Butterflies,"[Verse 1]
I was just coastin', never really goin' anywhere
Caught up in a web, I was gettin' kinda used to stayin' there
And out of the blue
I fell for you

[Chorus 1]
Now, you're lifting me up 'stead of holding me down
Stealing my heart 'stead of stealing my crown
Untangled all the strings 'round my wings that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud Nine was always out of reach
Now, I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies

[Verse 2]
Kiss full of color makes me wonder where you've always been
I was hiding in doubt 'til you brought me out of my chrysalis
And I came out new
All because of you

[Chorus]
And now, you're lifting me up 'stead of holding me down
Stealing my heart 'stead of stealing my crown
Untangled all the strings 'round my wings that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud Nine was always out of reach
Now, I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies, yeah
You give me butterflies

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, mm, mm

[Chorus]
Now, you're lifting me up 'stead of holding me down
You're taking my hand 'stead of taking my crown
Untangled all the strings 'round my wings that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud Nine was always out of reach
Now, I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies (Mm)
You give me butterflies (Mm)"
Kacey Musgraves,Slow Burn,"[Verse 1]
Born in a hurry, always late
Haven't been early since '88
Texas is hot, I can be cold
Grandma cried when I pierced my nose
Good in a glass, good on green
Good when you're puttin' your hands all over me

[Chorus]
I'm alright with a slow burn
Taking my time, let the world turn
I'm gonna do it my way, it'll be alright
If we burn it down and it takes all night
It's a slow burn, yeah

[Verse 2]
In Tennessee, the sun's goin' down
But in Beijing, they're headin' out to work
You know the bar down the street don't close for an hour
We should take a walk and look at all the flowers

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm alright with a slow burn
Taking my time, let the world turn
I'm gonna do it my way, it'll be alright
If we burn it down and it takes all night
It's a slow burn

[Bridge]
Mm, whatever feels good
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Mm

Old soul, waitin' my turn
I know a few things, but I still got a lot to learn
So I'm alright with a slow burn, slow burn, slow burn
Mm, I'm alright with a slow burn"
Kacey Musgraves,Golden Hour,"[Verse 1]
All that I know
Is you caught me at the right time
Keep me in your glow
'Cause I'm having such a good time
With you

[Chorus]
Baby, don't you know?
That you're my golden hour
The color of my sky
You've set my world on fire
And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright

[Verse 2]
I used to get sad
And lonely when the sun went down
But it's different now
'Cause I love the light that I've found
In you

[Chorus]
Baby, don't you know?
That you're my golden hour
The color of my sky
You've set my world on fire
And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright

[Bridge]
You make the world look beautiful, ooh
I thought I'd seen it all before
But looking through your eyes
It looks like paradise

[Chorus]
You've set my world on fire, yeah
And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright
You're my golden hour
The color of my sky
You've set my world on fire
And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright
Yeah, I know, I know everything's gonna be alright
Golden hour"
Kacey Musgraves,Space Cowboy,"[Verse 1]
You look out the window while I look at you
Saying I don't know would be like saying that the sky ain't blue
And boots weren't made for sitting by the door
Since you don't wanna stay anymore

[Chorus]
You can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on, ride away in your Silverado
Guess I'll see you 'round again
I know my place, and it ain't with you
Well sunsets fade, and love does, too
Yeah, we had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run, there ain't no sense in closing the gate
You can have your space, cowboy

[Verse 2]
After the gold rush, there ain't no reason to stay
Shoulda learned from the movies that good guys don't run away
But roads weren't made to not go down
And there ain't room for both of us in this town

[Chorus]
So you can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on, ride away in your Silverado
I'll see you around again
'Cause I know my place, and it ain't with you
Sunsets fade, and love does, too
We had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run, ain't no sense in closing the gate
So you can have your space

[Chorus]
You can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on, ride away in your Silverado
I'll see you around again
'Cause I know my place, and it ain't with you
Sunsets fade, and love does, too
Though we had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run, ain't no sense in closing the gate
You can have your space
Yeah, you can have your space
You can have your space, cowboy"
Kacey Musgraves,Deeper Well,"[Verse 1]
My Saturn has returned
When I turned twenty-seven, everything started to change
Took a long time, but I learned
There's two kinds of people, one is a giver
And one's always tryin' to take
All they can take

[Chorus]
So I'm sayin' goodbye to the people that I feel
Are real good at wastin' my time
No regrets, baby, I just think that maybe
You go your way and I'll go mine
It's been a real good time
But you got dark energy, somethin' I can't unsee
And I've got to take care of myself
I found a deeper well

[Verse 2]
I used to wake and bake
Roll out of bed, hit the gravity bong that I made
And start the day
For a while, it got me by
Everything I did seemed better when I was high
I don't know why

[Chorus]
So I'm gettin' rid of the habits that I feel
Are real good at wastin' my time
No regrets, baby, I just think that maybe
It's natural when things lose their shine
So other things can glow
I've gotten older, now I know
How to take care of myself
I found a deeper well

[Post-Chorus]
Mm

[Verse 3]
When I was growing up
We had what we needed, shoes on our feet
But the world was as flat as a plate
And that's okay

[Chorus]
The things I was taught only took me so far
Had to figure the rest out myself
And then I found
I found a deeper well

[Post-Chorus]
Mm

If you ain't got two kids by twenty-one
You're probably gonna die alone
At least that's what tradition told you
And it don't matter if you don't believe
Come Sunday morning you best be
There in the front row, like you're s'posed to

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Same hurt in every heart
Same trailer, different park
[Chorus]
Mama's hooked on Mary Kay
Brother's hooked on Mary Jane
And Daddy's hooked on Mary two doors down
Mary, Mary, quite contrary
We get bored so we get married
And just like dust, we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
And 'round and 'round we go
Where it stops, nobody knows
And it ain't slowin' down
This merry go 'round

[Verse 2]
We think the first time's good enough
So we hold on to high school love
Say we won't end up like our parents
Tiny little boxes in a row
Ain't what you want, it's what you know
Just happy in the shoes you're wearin'

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Same checks we're always cashin'
To buy a little more distraction

[Chorus]
'Cause Mama's hooked on Mary Kay
Brother's hooked on Mary Jane
And Daddy's hooked on Mary two doors down
Mary, Mary, quite contrary
We get bored so we get married
And just like dust, we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
And 'round and 'round we go
Where it stops, nobody knows
And it ain't slowin' down
This merry go 'round

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Mary, Mary, quite contrary
We're so bored until we're buried
And just like dust we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
Merry go 'round

[Outro]
Jack and Jill went up the hill
Jack burned out on booze and pills
And Mary had a little lamb
Mary just don't give a damn no more"
Kacey Musgraves,Follow Your Arrow,"[Verse 1]
If you save yourself for marriage, you're a bore
If you don't save yourself for marriage, you're a horrible person
If you won't have a drink, then you're a prude
But they'll call you a drunk as soon as you down the first one
If you can't lose the weight, then you're just fat
But if you lose too much, then you're on crack
You're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't
So, you might as well just do whatever you want
[Chorus]
So make lots of noise (Hey)
Kiss lots of boys (Yeah)
Or kiss lots of girls, if that's somethin' you're into
When the straight and narrow gets a little too straight
Roll up a joint, or don't
Just follow your arrow wherever it points, yeah
Follow your arrow wherever it points

[Verse 2]
If you don't go to church, you'll go to Hell
If you're the first one on the front row, you're a self-righteous son of a
Can't win for losin', you'll just disappoint 'em
Just 'cause you can't beat 'em, don't mean you should join 'em

[Chorus]
So make lots of noise (Hey)
Kiss lots of boys (Yeah)
Or kiss lots of girls, if that's somethin' you're into
When the straight and narrow gets a little too straight
Roll up a joint, or don't
Just follow your arrow wherever it points, yeah
Follow your arrow wherever it points

[Bridge]
Say what you think (Say what you think)
Love who you love (Love who you love)
'Cause you just get so many trips around the sun
Yeah, you only, only live once

[Chorus]
So make lots of noise (Hey)
Kiss lots of boys (Yeah)
Or kiss lots of girls, if that's what you're into
When the straight and narrow gets a little too straight
Roll up a joint, I would
And follow your arrow wherever it points, yeah
Follow your arrow wherever it points"
Kacey Musgraves,Happy & Sad,"[Verse 1]
It's not you, it's the glow of the party
The way that you've got me lit up inside
It's the song that they're playin', the words that you're sayin'
It's never felt so right

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm the kind of person who starts getting kinda nervous
When I'm having the time of my life

[Chorus]
Is there a word for the way that I'm feeling tonight?
Happy and sad at the same time
You got me smiling with tears in my eyes
I never felt so high
No, I've never been this far off of the ground
And they say everything that goes up must come down
But I don't wanna come down

[Verse 2]
So is there a way to stop all this thinkin', just keep on drinkin'?
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
When they're turnin' the lights on and it turns out the joke's on me
'Cause it feels so right

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm the kind of person who starts getting kinda nervous
When I'm having the time of my life

[Chorus]
Is there a word for the way that I'm feeling tonight?
Happy and sad at the same time
You got me smilin' with tears in my eyes
I never felt so high
No, I've never been this far off of the ground
And they say everything that goes up must come down
But I don't wanna come down

[Bridge]
I don't mind at all, no, I'm used to fallin'
I'm comfortable when the sky is gray
But when everything is perfect, I start hidin'
'Cause I know that rain is comin' my way, my way

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm happy and sad at the same time
You got me smilin' with tears in my eyes
I never felt so high
No, I've never been this far off of the ground
And they say everything that goes up, goes up must come down
And I don't wanna come down
No, I don't wanna come down"
Kacey Musgraves,High Horse,"[Verse 1]
Oh, I bet you think you're John Wayne
Showin' up and shootin' down everybody
You're classic in the wrong way
And we all know the end of the story

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause everyone knows someone who kills the buzz
Every time they open up their mouth
Yeah, everyone knows someone who knows someone
Who thinks they're cooler than everybody else

[Chorus]
And I think we've seen enough, seen enough
To know that you ain't ever gonna come down
So, why don't you giddy up, giddy up
And ride straight out of this town?
You and your high horse, mmm-mmm
You and your high horse, mmm-mmm

I bet you think you're first place, yeah
Someone should give you a ribbon
And put you in the hall of fame
For all the games that you think that you're winning

'Cause everyone knows someone who kills the buzz
Every time they open up their mouth
Yeah, everyone knows someone who knows someone
Who thinks they're cooler than everybody else

[Chorus]
And I think we've seen enough, seen enough
To know that you ain't ever gonna come down
So, why don't you giddy up, giddy up
And ride straight out of this town?
You and your high horse, mmm-mmm
You and your high horse, mmm-mmm

[Bridge]
Darlin', you take the high horse and I'll take the high road
Mmm-mmm
If you're too good for us, you'll be good riding solo

[Chorus]
Yeah, I think we've seen enough, seen enough
To know that you ain't ever gonna come down
So, why don't you giddy up, giddy up
And ride straight out of this town?
You and your high horse, mmm-mmm
You and your high horse, mmm-mmm
High horse, mmm-mmm
You ain't ever gonna come down
You ain't ever gonna come down"
Kacey Musgraves,​justified,"[Verse 1]
It was a fun, strange summer
I rolled on, didn't think of you
We lost touch with each other
Fall came and I had to move

[Pre-Chorus]
Movin' backwards, hurt comes after
Healin' doesn't happen in a straight line

[Chorus]
If I cry just a little and then laugh in the middle
If I hate you and I love you, and then I change my mind
If I need just a little more time to deal with the fact
That you shoulda treated me right
Then I'm more than just a little justified
Mm, mm
I'm more than just a little justified

[Verse 2]
To touch somebody
You know I tried to make that you
And when you lied, said you didn't want me
Tell me, what was I supposed to do?

[Pre-Chorus]
Movin' onwards, feelin' strong, but
Healin' doesn't happen in a straight line

[Chorus]
If I cry just a little and then laugh in the middle
If I hate you and I love you, and then I change my mind
If I need just a little more time to deal with the fact
That you shoulda treated me right
Then I'm more than just a little justified
Mm, mm
I'm more than just a little justified

[Bridge]
If I die just a little, inside just a little
If I want you and I call you, then I change my mind
If I need just a little more time to deal with the fact
That I shoulda treated you right
I'm more than just a little

[Chorus]
If I cry just a little and then laugh in the middle
And I hate you and I love you, and then I change my mind (A million times)
If I need just a little more time to deal with the fact
That you shoulda treated me right
Then I'm more than just a little justified
Mm, mm
I'm more than just a little justified"

There's all kinds of magic; it's hard to believe
Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
There's all kinds of magic; it's hard to believe

Northern lights in our skies
Plants that grow and open your mind
Things that swim with a neon glow
How we all got here, nobody knows

These are real things

Kacey Musgraves,​breadwinner,"[Verse 1]
Here's what he'll do, he'll play it cool
When he hangs out with a woman like you
Say he ain't pressed by all your success
Tell you he's different than all of the rest

[Pre-Chorus]
You're gonna give it all and give it all
But you won't get it back
I'm tellin' you, it's gonna hurt
Stay away from a boy like that

[Chorus]
He wants a breadwinner
He wants your dinner
Until he ain't hungry anymore
He wants your shimmer
To make him feel bigger
Until he starts feelin' insecure
I wish somebody would've told me the truth
Say, ""He's never gonna know what to do
With a woman like you
With a woman like you""

[Verse 2]
I see the games a mile away
They only end when another heart breaks
But all of his wounds ain't an excuse
For you to put up with how he treats you

[Pre-Chorus]
You're gonna give it all and give it all
But you won't get it back
I'm tellin' you, it's gonna hurt
Stay away from a boy like that

He wants a breadwinner
He wants your dinner
Until he ain't hungry anymore
He wants your shimmer
To make him feel bigger
Until he starts feelin' insecure
I wish somebody would've told me the truth
Say, ""He's never gonna know what to do
With a woman like you

I can sleep at night
Knowing I really tried
I put in the time
But the fault isn't mine

[Chorus]
That he wants a breadwinner
He wants your dinner
Until he ain't hungry anymore (Anymore)
He wants a breadwinner
He wants your dinner
Until he ain't hungry anymore (Anymore)
He wants your shimmer
To make him feel bigger

With a woman like you and me""
He likes what he sees"
Kacey Musgraves,​star-crossed,"[Intro]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Verse]
Let me set the scene
Two lovers ripped right at the seams
They woke up from the perfect dream
And then the darkness came
I signed the papers yesterday
You came and took your things away
I moved out of the home we made
And gave you back your name

[Chorus]
What have we done?
Did we fly too high just to get burned by the sun?
No one's to blame
'Cause we called all the angels to save us
Called them by name
But I guess they got lost
Star-crossed

[Outro]
(Star-crossed, star-crossed, star-crossed, star-crossed)
(Star-crossed, star-crossed, star-crossed, star-crossed)

Kacey Musgraves,Mother,"[Verse]
Bursting with empathy
I'm feeling everything
The weight of the world on my shoulders
Hope my tears don't freak you out
They're just kinda coming out
It's the music in me and all of the colors

[Chorus]
Wish we didn't live
Wish we didn't live so far from each other
I'm just sitting here
Thinking 'bout the time that's slipping
And missing my mother
Mother
And she's probably sitting there
Thinking 'bout the time that's slipping
And missing her mother
Mother"
Kacey Musgraves,All Is Found (Kacey Musgraves Version),"[Verse 1]
Where the north wind meets the sea
There's a river full of memory
Sleep, my darling, safe and sound
For in this river all is found
All is found
When all is lost, then all is found

[Verse 2]
In her waters, deep and true
Lie the answers and a path for you
Dive down deep into her sound
But not too far or you'll be drowned

[Verse 3]
She will sing to those who'll hear
And in her song, all magic flows
But can you brave what you most fear?
Can you face what the river knows?

[Verse 4]
Until the river's finally crossed
You'll never feel the solid ground
You had to get a little lost
On your way to being found

[Verse 5]
Where the north wind meets the sea
There's a mother full of memory
Come, my darling, homeward bound
Where all is lost, then all is found

[Outro]
All is found
All is found"
Kacey Musgraves,Biscuits,"[Verse 1]
Taking down your neighbor won't take you any higher
I burned my own damn finger poking someone else's fire
I've never gotten taller making someone else feel small
If you ain't got nothing nice to say, don't say nothing at all

[Chorus]
Just ho​e your own row and raise your own babies
Smoke your own smoke and grow your own daisies
Mend your own fences and own your own crazy
Mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy
Mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy

[Verse 2]
Nobody's perfect, we've all lost and we've all lied
Most of us have cheated, the rest of us have tried
The holiest of holies even slip from time to time
We've all got dirty laundry hanging on the line

[Chorus]
So ho​e your own row and raise your own babies
Smoke your own smoke and grow your own daisies
Mend your own fences and own your own crazy
Mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy
Yeah, mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy

[Bridge]
Pouring salt in my sugar won't make yours any sweeter
Pissing in my yard ain't gonna make yours any greener
And I wouldn't know about the rocks in your shoes
So I'll just do me and, honey, you can just do you
(So, row)

[Chorus]
So ho​e your own row and raise your own babies
Smoke your own smoke and grow your own daisies
Mend your own fences and own your own crazy
Mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy
Mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy"
Kacey Musgraves,​cherry blossom,"[Verse 1]
Early April, you walked up to me
Changing colors on city streets
Petals surrounding us in every shade of pink
We happened quickly, as humans do
Summer was coming and change was, too
Look at me now, I'm falling at your feet

[Chorus]
I'm your cherry blossom, baby
Don't let me blow away
I hope you haven't forgotten
Tokyo wasn't built in a day
I'm your cherry blossom, baby
I don't wanna blow away

[Verse 2]
When we're on fire, it's something to see
No one can question the chemistry
Even in nature, timing is everything

[Chorus]
I'm your cherry blossom, baby
Don't let me blow away
I hope you haven't forgotten
Tokyo wasn't built in a day
Yeah, I'm your cherry blossom, baby
I don't wanna blow away
Away
Away

[Chorus]
I'm your cherry blossom, baby
Don't let mе blow away
I hope you haven't forgotten

Don't wanna blow away

Let's go back to the beginning
I just wanna be a good wife

[Verse 1]
Wake him up nice and slow, bring coffee in bed
Listen to his problems, tell him that I understand
Touch him so he knows in his heart he's the only one
Try to loosen up and be more fun, yeah, I could be more fun

[Chorus]
God, help me be a good wife
'Cause he needs me
Even when he's not right
He still needs me

[Verse 2]
Help me let go of all the things that make me mad
At the еnd of the day, he's gotta know that I've got his back
And if hе comes home stressed out, I could pack him a bowl
Just let him be himself, don't try to control

[Chorus]
God, help me be a good wife
'Cause he needs me
And even when he's not right
Yeah, he still needs me

[Bridge]
And the truth is

But without him
This house just wouldn't be a home
And I don't wanna be alone

God, help me be a good wife
Yeah, 'cause he needs me, oh
And even when he's not right
I know he still needs me

Kacey Musgraves,​camera roll,"[Verse 1]
Don't go through your camera roll
So much you don't know that you've forgotten
What a trip, the way you can flip
Through all the good parts of it, I shouldn't have done it

[Chorus]
Chronological order and nothing but torture
Scroll too far back, that's what you get
I don't wanna see 'em, but I can't delete 'em
It just doesn't feel right yet, not yet

[Verse 2]
All the best, that's all that's left
Cruel evidence, it does me no favors
I should know it's a place not to go
When I'm alone, I'll just feel bad later

[Chorus]
Chronological order and nothing but torture
Scroll too far back, that's what you get
I don't wanna see 'em, but I can't delete 'em
It just doesn't feel right yet, not yet

[Bridge]
Hmm, look at me, I'm living all alone
And now you're only living in my phone

[Outro]
Anyway, thanks for all the nights and the days
And everything that you gave, I'll never erase it
There's one where we look so in love
Before we lost all the sun and I made you take it"
Kacey Musgraves,Velvet Elvis,"[Verse 1]
All I ever wanted was something classic
The kind of love song that goes on 'til the end of time
All I ever wanted was a little magic
With a good laugh, jet-black sparkle in his eyes

[Chorus]
You're my velvet Elvis, I ain't never gonna take you down
Making everybody jealous when they step into my house
Soft to the touch, feels like love, knew it as soon as I felt it
You're my velvet Elvis, baby

I don't really care 'bout the Mona Lisa
I need a Graceland kind of man who's always on my mind
I wanna show you off every evening
Go out with you in powder blue and tease my hair up high

You're my velvet Elvis, I ain't never gonna take you down
Making everybody jealous when they step into my house
Soft to the touch, feels like love, knew it as soon as I felt it

Kacey Musgraves,Love Is a Wild Thing,"[Verse 1]
You can't find it sitting on a shelf in a store
If you try to hide it, it's gonna shine even more

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Even if you lose it, it will find you
There's no way to stop it, but they'll try to

[Chorus]
Running like a river tryna find the ocean
Flowers in the concrete
Climbing over fences, blooming in the shadows
Places that you can't see
Coming through the melody when the night bird sings
Love is a wild thing

Oh, I can feel it, magic in your fingertips
And I can hear it in the words coming off your lips

Even if you lose me, I will find you
There's no way to stop it, so don't try to

But not anymore, anymore, no

I got a million things to do, but I haven't done a single one, no

Kacey Musgraves,Wonder Woman,"[Verse 1]
I like where this is going
You like it too
We rarely never ever don't see eye to eye
We're going to

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I can show you strong, I can fight for you
I can try to move mountains if you want me to

[Chorus]
But, baby, I ain't Wonder Woman
I don't know how to lasso the love out of you
Don't you know I'm only human?
And if I let you down, I don't mean to
All I need's a place to land
I don't need a Superman to win my lovin'
'Cause, baby, I ain't Wonder Woman

Bet all that gold gets heavy
Weighin' on her
I wonder if it's scary
Always tryin' not to get hurt

I know how it feels, it ain't easy
There's a reason why you only see it in the movies

'Cause, baby, I ain't Wonder Woman

And if I let you down, I don't mean to

Yeah, I know I ain't Wonder Woman"
Kacey Musgraves,John Prine,"[Verse 1]
Get a little drunk, get a little loud
Stupid me and my rebel mouth
Ain't all wrong but I ain't alright
Don't see the world in black and white
My grandma cried when I pierced my nose
I never liked doing what I was told
Don't judge me and I won't judge you
'Cause I ain't walkin' in your shoes

[Chorus]
'Cause I ain't one to knock religion
Though it's always knockin' me
Always runnin' with the wrong crowd
Right where I want to be
And I ain't good at being careful
I just say what's on my mind
Like my idea of heaven
Is to burn one with John Prine

[Verse 2]
And maybe he would sit awhile
And render me an illegal smile
And I bet that he would understand
Just how I feel and who I am

[Chorus]
'Cause I ain't one to knock religion
Though it's always knockin' me
Always runnin' with the wrong crowd
Right where I want to be
And I ain't good at being careful
I just say what's on my mind
Like my idea of heaven
Is to burn one with John Prine

[Bridge]
And I play my life like truth or dare
I'm not all here but I'm all there, yeah
And all the colors people paint me
Don't they know they'll never change me, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause I ain't one to knock religion
Though it's always knockin' me
Always runnin' with the wrong crowd
Right where I want to be
And I ain't good at being careful
I just say what's on my mind
Like my idea of heaven
Is to burn one with John Prine
Yeah, my idea of heaven
Is to burn one with John Prine"
The Mavericks,All You Ever Do Is Bring Me Down,"I can't sleep a wink anymore
Ever since you first walked out the door
Then I just started drinking to forget
But I don't think the worst has happend yet

Chorus
All you ever do is bring me down
Making me a fool all over town
They all wonder why I wear a frown
That's cause honey all you ever do is bring me down

It's funny how my whole world fell apart
I think I saw it coming from the start
I tried to tell myself that you'd be true
But I expected way too much of you

All you ever do is bring me down
Making me a fool all over town
They all wonder why I wear a frown
That's cause honey all you ever do is bring me down

All you ever do is bring me down
Making me a fool all over town
They all wonder why I wear a frown
That's cause honey all you ever do is bring me down
That's cause honey all you ever do is bring me down
Honey all you ever do is bring me down

Here comes my happiness again
Right back to where it should have been
'Cause now she's gone and I am free
And she can't do a thing to me

[Chorus]
I just wanna dance the night away
With señoritas who can sway
Right now tomorrow's lookin' bright
Just like the sunny mornin' light

Please let her know that I'm well
As you can tell
And if she should tell you
That she wants me back
Tell her no
I gotta go

The Mavericks,Come Unto Me,"If your world has only done you wrong
And all you find yourself is all alone
And if there's no one there to see you through
I'll be there for you
And in your darkest hour I'll be light
I'll be your beacon through the longest night
Like Samson and Delilah once again
Until the bitter end

To persuade me to change my mind needlessly
For here I am and I will stay
To long for you in every way
To love you better, come what may
To fight for you another day, day, day
Come unto me
Come unto me
Come unto me
Come unto me
There is nothing that anyone can say to me
To persuade me to change my mind needlessly
For here I am and I will stay
To long for you in every way
To love you better, come what may
To fight for you another day, day, day
Come unto me
Come unto me
Come unto me
Come unto me

The Mavericks,(Tonight) The Bottle Let Me Down,"Well, each night I leave the barroom when it's over
Not feeling any pain at closing time
But tonight your memory found me much too sober
Well, I said I couldn't drink enough to keep you off of
My mind

Tonight the bottle let me down
And let your memory hang around
But the one and only friend I thought I'd found
Well, tonight the bottle let me down

Well, each night I need a bottle I can turn to
Lately, baby, I've been turnin' every day
But the wine don't take effect the way it used to

And I'm hurtin' in that old familiar way

Tonight the bottle let me down
And let your memory hang around
But the one and only friend I thought I'd found
Well, tonight the bottle let me down

They would know why it's no mystery
She's not ordinary, it's her love I carry
I was born, born to be blue

I'm the fool who sees tomorrow
But all that time has just been borrowed
She's the only reason that I keep believin'
I was born, born to be blue

For everybody, there's someone just for them
And like anybody, you lose one every now and then
For everybody, there's someone just for them
And like anybody, you lose one every now and then

I have found that I'm still fallin'
Maybe I have found my callin'
She's the only reason that I keep believin'
I was born, born to be blue

It's her love I carry
I was born, born to be blue
I was born, born to be blue"
The Mavericks,Back In Your Arms Again,"Back in your arms again

Once I said I never want your love again
You showed up to night and proved me wrong
Things I said I'll never do since you and I were through

I heard from someone that you were back in town
I knew I couldn't stay away
No matter how I tried this love won't be denied
And here I am back in your arms again
Woo here I am back in your arms again

I should know better
Oh what does it matter to a love sick fool
I know I said never but I know forever I'll come back to you
I'll keep coming back to you

Oh what does it matter to a love sick fool
I know I said never but I know forever I'll come back to you

Doesn't want to let you go

There go my eyes
Crying over you
My arms don't want

The Mavericks,Think Of Me (When You’re Lonely),"(Don Rich and Estella Olsson)

Think of me when you're lonely
Think of me when you're blue
Think of me when you're far away
For I'll be thinking of you

Remember all the good times
We shared in days gone by
Remember all the sadness
The day you said goodbye

Think of me when you're lonely
Think of me when you're blue
Think of me when you're far away
For I'll be thinking of you

You said that you were leavin'
But you wouldn't be gone too long
With each new day I hope and pray
That you'll come travellin' home

Think of me when you're lonely
Think of me when you're blue
Think of me when you're far away
For I'll be thinking of you

I watch the mailman come
I listen for the phone
I meet the trains at the station
But I spend my nights alone
Now the waiting is over
And the time has set the scene
Yes, God meant me for only you
And he meant you for me

Think of me when you're lonely
Think of me when you're blue
Think of me when you're far away
For I'll be thinking of you
For I'll be thinking of you"
The Mavericks,Here Comes My Baby,"(Cat Stevens)

In the midnight moonlight hour
He's walking along that lonely mile
And every time I do
I keep seeing this picture of you

Here comes my baby
Here she comes now
And it comes as no surprise to me
With another guy
Well here comes my baby
Here she comes now
Walkin' with a love, with a love
That's oh so fine
Never to be mine no matter how I try

You'll never walk alone
And you're forever talkin' on the phone
And I try to call your name
But every time it comes out the same

Here comes my baby
Here she comes now
And it comes as no surprise to me
With another guy
Well here comes my baby
Here she comes now
Walkin' with a love, with a love
That's oh so fine
Never to be mine no matter how I try

Here comes my baby
Here she comes now
And it comes as no surprise to me
With another guy
Well here comes my baby
Here she comes now
Walkin' with a love, with a love
That's oh so fine
Never to be mine no matter how I try"
The Mavericks,From Hell To Paradise,"(Raul Malo)

For thirty years they sang the
Song of promised victory
But who they've fought and who has won
Didn't matter much to me
I see them driving down the streets
In their fancy shiny cars
Crowds of people to their feet
Their faces full of scars

No pleasantries, no luxuries
No little children's milk
While minister's wives spent
All their lives
In China's finest silk
My back's been broken many times
But my spirit lingers on
The day it comes my way on
Freedom's ship
I will be gone

Chorus
From hell to paradise
I'll always pay the price
From hell to paradise
I'll always pay the price

This ninety mile trip
Has taken thirty years to make
They tried to keep
Forever what was never theirs to take
I cursed and scratched the devil's hand
As he stood in front of me
One last drag from his big cigar
And he finally set me free

Repeat chorus twice

Con ojos tiernos algun dia te mirare
Con brases abiertos algun dia abrasare
Hay mi Havana cuando pueda regresare

Translation:
With tender eyes someday I'll look at you
With open arms someday I'll embrace you
My old Havana someday I will return"
The Mavericks,Dream River,"(Raul Malo, Evan York)

Floating down the dream river
With the moon and stars above
Maybe they can help me find a way
To have your whole love

Sleeping in the darkest room
Dreaming you are in my arms
Oh how I wish my dream comes true
With all my heart

Don't want this night to end
Don't want to live without you

Floating down the dream river
With you by my side
I know it's make-believe
But please don't wake me
I don't mind

(Whistles melody)

Don't want this night to end
Don't want to live without you

Floating down the dream river
With you by my side
I know it's make-believe
But please don't wake me
I don't mind
I know it's make-believe
But please don't wake me
I don't mind"

The Mavericks,Pizziricco,"(Raul Malo and Kostas)

The sun is always shining wherever you go
And there's an angel watching over you I know
You get away with everything but not very far
That's just what you are
Everybody knows you in the neighborhood
And sometimes what they say isn't always that good
You're not misbehavin', you're misunderstood
But we still love you

Hey Pizzirico, bet you know that your mama loves you
Pizzirico, bet you know that your daddy does too
Pizzirico, wherever you go, whatever you do
Pizzirico, your dreams will come true

You and all your little friends are runnin' around
Gettin' into trouble never brings you down
You have been my happiness right from the start
The joy of my heart

Hey Pizzirico, bet you know that your mama loves you
Pizzirico, bet you know that your daddy does too
Pizzirico, wherever you go, whatever you do
Pizzirico, your dreams will come true

The Mavericks,Let It Rain (On Me),"[Verse 1]
Wherever this old road ends up winding through
May it take me home so I can be with you
As I lay in bed waiting for my dreams
I'll rest my weary head and maybe get some sleep

So it can wash away
Sorrows and pains
Before a brand new day

Before the teardrops start, let it rain on me

Take my heartlight and roses that I offer you

Maybe I'm the fool that let you walk away
With memories of your sweet embrace and loving words
I'm here to plead my case

This one thought keeps running through morning, noon and night
I want to dance in the moonlight only with you
Take my heartlight and roses that I offer you

And I'll give her what's left of my world
And I won't even put up a fight
As long as there's loving tonight

With little or nothing to say
When I know she's wrong, that's alright
As long as there's loving tonight
Well alright, OK, she wins again
Well I've seen this all before, how our story ends
The kiss I can't resist she always calls goodbye
Well in time I've come to find
It's my favorite line
Well no one else can play our crazy little games
They're meant for us and us alone
Where losing feels like winning
The end is the beginning
The better I should know
So please baby please, go easy on me
Tell me what you need
My dear I'll agree
As long as there's loving tonight
I'm hers for the rest of my life
And I won't even put up a fight

The Mavericks,I Don’t Care If You Love Me Anymore,"Well I've worked all night and day
To try to please you
To buy the things I never could afford
And now the well's run dry for me
So I must leave
But I don't care if you love me anymore
Well you go out on the town
With eyes of cheating
To see a world
You've never seen before
But my heart was alway's there
To take a beating
I don't care
If you don't love me anymore
You never showed the slightest bit
Of heartache
When I told you
I was leaving you for good
You tried to justify
What you did always
Some things are better left
Than understood
Now the world keeps turning
When we're not together
And my troubles
Have all been washed ashore
But I'll sail the seven seas
Then I'll end up knowing
I don't care
If you love me anymore
You never showed
The slightest bit of heartache
Oh when I told you
I was leaving you
You tried to justify
What you did always
Some things are better left
Than understood
Now the world keeps turning
When we're not together
And my troubles
Have all been washed ashore
But I'll sail the seven seas

Darius Rucker,Wagon Wheel,"[Verse 1]
Heading down south to the land of the pines
I'm thumbing my way into North Caroline
Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm a-hoping for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight

[Chorus]
So rock me, mama, like a wagon wheel
Rock me, mama, any way you feel
Hey, mama, rock me
Rock me, mama, like the wind and the rain
Rock me, mama, like a southbound train
Hey, mama, rock me

[Verse 2]
Running from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band
My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now
Oh, north country winters keep a-getting me down
Lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town
But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more

[Chorus]
So rock me, mama, like a wagon wheel
Rock me, mama, any way you feel
Hey, mama, rock me
Rock me, mama, like the wind and the rain
Rock me, mama, like a southbound train
Hey, mama, rock me

[Verse 3]
Walking to the south out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke
But he's a heading west from the Cumberland gap
To Johnson City, Tennessee
And I got to get a move on before the sun
I hear my baby calling my name and I know that she's the only one
And if I die in Raleigh at least I will die free

[Chorus]
So rock me, mama, like a wagon wheel
Rock me, mama, any way you feel
Hey, mama, rock me
Rock me, mama, like the wind and the rain
Rock me, mama, like a southbound train
Hey, mama, rock me
So rock me, mama, like a wagon wheel
Rock me, mama, any way you feel
Hey, hey, mama, rock me
Mama, rock me
Mama, rock me
Rock me, mama, like the wind and the rain
Rock me, mama, like a southbound train
Hey, hey, mama, rock me
You can rock me
Rock me"
Darius Rucker,If I Told You,"[Verse 1]
What if I told you about my little nothing town?
The two room house where I came from
The man that I got my name from
I don't even know where he is now

[Verse 2]
What if I told you sometimes I lose my faith?
I wonder why someone like you would even talk to me
What if I told you there's no fixing me
'Cause everybody's already tried

[Pre-Chorus]
Would you stay? Would you leave?
I could wait, it'll all come out eventually

[Chorus]
If I told you all the stupid things I've done
I blamed on being young
But I was old enough to know, I know
If I told you the mess that I can be
When there's no one there to see
Would you look the other way, could you love me anyway?

[Verse 3]
What if I told you I don't plan on staying here?
My dreams are a million miles away
And I know your family's gonna want you to stay
You know what? I don't blame them

[Pre-Chorus]
So I'll say what I don't want to
And I'll just pray you want what I do, mhmm

[Chorus]
If I told you all the stupid things I've done
I blamed on being young
But I was old enough to know, I know
If I told you the mess that I can be
When there's no one there to see
Could you look the other way, could you love me anyway?
Oh, could you love me anyway?

[Bridge]
So before we go any further here
Let a week turn into another year
There's some things you probably don't wanna hear
But you have to

[Outro]
If I told you sometimes I get jealous
Sometimes I'm half crazy
Would you say the hell with me, the hell with me?
If I told you I barely know what love is
But girl, if that's what this is
I don't wanna let it slip away, oh, no, no, no
Could you love me anyway, please?
Could you love me anyway?
Could you love me anyway, ooh?
Could you love me anyway?"
Darius Rucker,For the First Time,"[Verse 1]
You say you never danced to a dashboard singin' R.E.M. under summer stars
Never leaned back on a jet black Chevy, blowing smoke rings in the dark
You don't want to be a rumor, girl, and I feel just the same
Yeah, I know that you don't know me well but we can make that change

[Chorus]
When was the last time you did something for the first time?
Yeah, let yourself go, follow that feeling
Maybe something new is what you're needing
Like a real life, let your hair down, feel alive
When was the last time you did something for the first time?

[Verse 2]
Say you never drank from the bottle of some two dollar wine, run barefoot through the mud
Never had the right kiss stolen from your lips, while you watched the sun come up
Well, I know your friends are watching and they probably disapprove
But give me just half a chance, girl, I'm daring you

[Chorus]
When was the last time you did something for the first time?
Yeah, let yourself go, baby, follow that feeling
Maybe something new is what you're needing
Like a real life, let your hair down, feel alive
When was the last time you did something for the first time?

[Bridge]
Now the way you're looking says you're living
I hope I ain't reading wrong
Cause the way you're shining I think you're thinking
It's been way too long

[Chorus]
When was the last time you did something for the first time?
Yeah, yeah, let yourself go, come on follow that feeling
Maybe something new is what you're needing
Like a real life, let your hair down, feel alive, alive
When was the last time, oh
You did something for the first time, girl?
Come on, baby
When was the last time, yeah
You did something for the first time?"
Darius Rucker,This,"[Verse 1]
Got a baby girl sleeping in my bedroom
And her mama laughing in my arms
There's the sound of rain on the rooftop
And the game's about to start

[Verse 2]
I don't really know how I got here
But I'm sure glad that I did
And it's crazy to think that one little thing
Could've changed all of it

Maybe it didn't turn out like I planned
Maybe that's why I'm such, such a lucky man

[Chorus]
For every stoplight I didn't make
Every chance I did or I didn't take
All the nights I went too far
All the girls that broke my heart
All the doors that I had to close
All the things I knew but I didn't know
Thank God for all I missed
Cause it led me here to
This

[Verse 3]
Like the girl that I loved in high school
Who said she could do better
Or that college I wanted to go to
Till I got that letter

[Verse 4]
All the fights and the tears and the heartache
I thought I'd never get through
And the moment I almost gave up
All lead me here to you

I didn't understand it way back when
But sitting here right now it all makes perfect sense

[Chorus]
For every stoplight I didn't make
Every chance I did or I didn't take
All the nights I went too far
All the girls that broke my heart
All the doors that I had to close
All the things I knew but I didn't know
Thank God for all I missed
Cause it led me here to this

[Bridge]
How I cried when my mama passed away
But now I've got an angel looking out for me today
So nothing's a mistake

[Chorus]
For every stoplight I didn't make
Every chance I did or I didn't take
All the nights I went too far
All the girls that broke my heart
All the doors that I had to close
All the things I knew but I didn't know
Thank God for all I missed
Cause it led me here to this

[Outro]
It led me here to
This"
Darius Rucker,Alright,"[Intro]
Alright, alright
Yeah, it's alright, alright

[Verse 1]
Don't need no five star reservations
I got spaghetti and a cheap bottle of wine
Don't need no concert in the city
I got a stereo and the 'Best Of Patsy Cline'

[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't got no caviar, no Dom Perignon
But as far as I can see I got everything I want

[Hook]
Because I got a roof over my head
The woman I love laying in my bed
And it's alright, alright
I got shoes under my feet
Forever in the eyes staring back at me
And it's alright, alright
Yeah, I got all I need
And it's alright by me

[Verse 2]
Maybe later on we'll walk down to the river
Lay on a blanket and stare up at the moon
It may not be no French Riviera
But it's all the same to me as long as I'm with you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
May be a simple life but that's okay, yeah
If you ask me baby, I think I've got it made

[Hook]
Because I got a roof over my head
The woman I love laying in my bed
And it's alright, alright
I got shoes under my feet
Forever in the eyes staring back at me
And it's alright, alright
Yeah, I got all I need
And it's alright by me

[Bridge]
When I lay down at night I thank the lord above
For giving me everything I ever could dream of

[Hook]
Because I got a roof over my head
The woman I love laying in my bed
And it's alright, alright
I got shoes under my feet
Forever in the eyes staring back at me
And it's alright, alright
Yeah, I got all I need
And it's alright by me"
Darius Rucker,It Won’t Be Like This for Long,"[Verse 1]
He didn't have to wake up
He'd been up all night
Lying there in bed listening
To his new born baby cry
He makes a pot of coffee
He splashes water on his face
His wife gives him a kiss and says
It is going to be OK

[Chorus]
It won't be like this for long
One day we'll look back laughing
At the week we brought her home
This phase is going to fly by
So baby just hold on
It won't be like this for long

[Verse 2]
Four years later bout four thirty
She's crawling in their bed
And when he drops her off at preschool
She's clinging to his leg
The teacher peels her off of him
He says what can I do
She says now do not you worry
This will only last a week or two

[Chorus]
It won't be like this for long
One day soon you'll drop her off
And she won't even know you're gone
This phase is going to fly by
If you could just hold on
It won't be like this for long

[Verse 3]
Someday soon she'll be a teenager
And at times he'll think she hates him
Then he'll walk her down the aisle
And he'll raise her veil
But right now she up and crying
And the truth is that he don't mind
As he kisses her good night
And she says her prayers
He lays down there beside her
Till her eyes are finally closed
And just watching her it breaks his heart
Cause he already knows

[Chorus]
It won't be like this for long
One day soon that little girl is going to be
All grown up and gone
Yeah this phase is going to fly by
He is trying to hold on
It won't be like this for long
It won't be like this for long"
Darius Rucker,Straight To Hell,"[Verse 1: Darius Rucker, Jason Aldean, Darius Rucker & Jason Aldean, Darius Rucker, Jason Aldean & Charles Kelley]
I grew up just west of the tracks
Holding me to hold me back
Around your door she's calling out my name
I come in at 5 AM
And she is waiting for me
She said, ""Where have you been?"", I said, ""I was out!""
She said, ""You're no good cause you're running without love""

[Chorus: Darius Rucker, Jason Aldean & Charles Kelley, Jason Aldean]
And I'm going straight to hell
Just like my momma said
I'm going straight to hell (to hell, woohoo)
I'm going straight to hell
Just like my momma said
I'm going straight to hell
Oh and I'm gonna burn it down, baby

[Verse 2: Luke Bryan, Charles Kelley, Darius Rucker, Luke Bryan, Charles Kelley & Darius Rucker]
The black widow and the ladies man
Met down at the laundromat
And tried to make me understand
And just then, her mother bursts in
And said, ""You're the son of that bitch in the wind
Get out of my house and hit the road""
And I kept falling like a Rolling Stones' song

[Chorus: Luke Bryan, Charles Kelley & Darius Rucker]
'Cause I'm going straight to hell
Just like my momma said
I'm going straight to hell (oh straight to hell)
I'm going straight to hell
Just like my momma said
I'm going straight to hell

[Verse 3: Luke Bryan, Jason Aldean, Charles Kelley, All]
The stars came out and warned me so
As I walked on down the road
Fifty bucks and a suitcase steered me clear
She took my hand as we walked into the sun
A new day's promise had just begun
We'll make it alone whether you like it or not
And I turned around and shouted ""Help me momma!""

[Chorus: All, Darius Rucker]
'Cause I'm going straight to hell
Just like my momma said
I'm going straight to hell
Oh yeah, I'm going straight to hell
Ooh just like my momma said
I'm going straight to hell

[Outro]
(Oh Lord help us
Yeah I'll bring the whiskey boys
Y'all taking me with ya
Help me Jesus, help me Jesus, we all are
Oh)"
Darius Rucker,Beers and Sunshine,"[Verse 1]
Well, I ain't gonna work today
Just wanna sit around and play
Gonna hit balls off the dock
Kick back in my flip-flops
Don't owe nothin' to the lender
Nothin' spinnin' in the blender
The only thing on my agenda is

[Chorus]
Beers and sunshine
Bonfires and summertime
Back porch nights in South Carolina
Ain't nothin' finer than me and my girl strikin' up a little lighter
'Cause everybody's down in a world gone crazy
Don't know how to fix it but I think maybe
Turn on the good times, turn off the TV
Yeah, the only B.S. I need is beers and sunshine

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna call my girl and say
Let's get our friends and hit the lake
Grab a boat and get to floatin'
A little buzzed and a little toasted
We're gonna hang and have a little fun now
Flying high like we'll never come down
We're gonna roll until we run out of

Beers and sunshine
Bonfires and summertime

Bonfires and summertime, time, time
Oh, oh oh, yeah"
Darius Rucker,One Tequila,"I've been known to drink a beer or two
And I can handle whiskey ninety proof
I'm just fine with a glass of wine, champagne to cabernet
But I crossed the line when I crossed the border and hang out with those aid
Cause with one tequila, it's bring on the salt and lime
With two tequilas the whole bar's a friend of mine
But with three tequilas my legs don't work no more
Yeah it's one tequila, two tequila, three tequila floor
I might end up in a Tijuana jail
Oh and I think it's table left and up of ale
Cannonball into a neighbor's pool without a stitch of clothes
But by the end of the night I'll be tongue tied tryin to offer up some espanol
Cause with one tequila, it's bring on the salt and lime
With two tequilas the whole bar's a friend of mine
But with three tequilas my legs don't work no more
Yeah it's one tequila, two tequila, three tequila floor
I'll be glad to pour for all you senioritas
I'd rather taste salty kiss than have a sip of your margarita
Cause with one tequila, please pass me the salt and lime
With two tequilas the whole world's a friend of mine
But with three tequilas my legs won't work no more
Yeah it's one tequila, two tequila, three tequila floor
It's four tequila, five tequila, six tequila door
Somebody take me home
Dude you know I can't drink tequila, call me a cab"
Darius Rucker,Come Back Song,"[Verse 1]
I woke up again this mornin'
And wouldn't you know it pourin' rain
I went and burned a pot of coffee
And like us I poured it down the drain

[Chorus]
'Cause I didn't know I needed you so
And letting you go was wrong
And baby I know you got your radio on
So this is my my bad, come back song

[Verse 2]
I know I said I wouldn't miss you
But now I'm sayin' I'm a fool
You're on the feel good side of leavin'
And I'm the backside of a mule

[Chorus]
And I didn't know I needed you so
And letting you go was wrong
And baby I know you got your radio on
So this is my so sad, come back song

And now I'm laying down without you
In this king size empty bed
And I wish I had my arms around you
But I'll just dream of you instead

And letting you go was wrong
And baby I know you got your radio on
So this is my get packed, come back

Darius Rucker,Hands On Me,"I know where I wanna go tonight
Been thinking about it all day
I been waiting on your paradise
I know that you know the way

I let the world outside our window
Do whatever it's gonna do
We'll have a body and soul revival
Right here in this room

When your lips touch mine I'm born again
If I never get to heaven, hell, I've already been
Lead me to salvation, girl, I'm down on my knees
Turn the lights off, slide your jeans off and put your hands on me

Chase your shadow through the secret garden
You'll be waiting for me there, there
I could whisper hallelujah, baby
But I don't have a prayer

And only you can save me
From the crazy that you make me

When your lips touch mine I'm born again
If I never get to heaven, hell, I've already been
Lead me to salvation, girl, I'm down on my knees
Turn the lights off, slide your jeans off and put your hands on me

And only you can save me
From the crazy that you make me

Put your hands on me
Put your hands on me
Hands on me
Put your hands on me

When your lips touch mine I'm born again
If I never get to heaven, hell, I've already been
Lead me to salvation, girl, I'm down on my knees
Turn the lights off, and slide your jeans off and put your hands on me

Turn the lights off, slide your jeans off and put your hands on me"
Darius Rucker,Don’t Think I Don’t Think About It,"[Verse 1]
I left out in a cloud of taillights and dust
Swore I was not coming back
Said I'd enough
Saw you in the rear view standing
Fading from my life
But I wasn't turning round
No, not this time

[Chorus]
But don't think I don't think about it
Don't think I don't have regrets
Don't think it don't get to me
Between the work and the hurt and the whiskey
Do not think I do not wonder about
Could have been, should have been all worked out
I know what I felt and I know what I said
But don't think I don't think about it

[Verse 2]
When we make choices we got to live with them
Heard you found a real good man, and you married him
I wonder if sometimes I cross your mind
Where would we be today?
If I never drove that car away

[Chorus]
But don't think I don't think about it
Don't think I don't have regrets
Don't think it don't get to me
Between the work and the hurt and the whiskey
Do not think I do not wonder about
Could have been, should have been all worked out
I know what I felt and I know what I said
But don't think I don't think about it
Don't think I don't think about it

[Chorus]
But don't think I don't think about it
Don't think I don't have regrets
Don't think it don't get to me
Between the work and the hurt and the whiskey
Do not think I do not wonder about
Could have been, should have been all worked out

Darius Rucker,Homegrown Honey,"[Verse 1]
Sitting at a bar in New York City
Everybody here looking New York pretty
But you’re the kinda girl that’s got that something
Dancing to the groove like it just ain’t nothing
They ain’t never seen nothing quite like you
Long stem legs in your cowboy boots
Throwing back whiskey straight, no water
Girl there ain’t nothing hotter

[Chorus]
Ooh, I dig the way that you move
You shake it down to your roots
Did your momma teach you how to do that thing you do
Yeah, nothing sweeter than wild
I’ll take a sip of that smile
I’ll bet the boys at home can’t leave you alone
You little homegrown honey, honey, honey
You’re so money, money, money
You got a country road Carolina soul
Baby you’re just so homegrown

[Verse 2]
Trying to think of something cool to say
Turned around and saw you walking my way
Pulled me on the floor saying “Son it’s on”
And we were dancing all night long
To a sweet old Alabama song

[Chorus]
Ooh, I dig the way that you move
You shake it down to your roots
Did your momma teach you how to do that thing you do
Yeah, nothing sweeter than wild
I’ll take a sip of that smile
I’ll bet the boys at home can’t leave you alone
You little homegrown honey, honey, honey
You’re so money, money, money
You got a country road Carolina soul
Baby you’re just so homegrown

Ooh baby, baby, baby
You’re driving me crazy, crazy, crazy
I’m a long way away from where I’m from
But baby you feel like home

Ooh, I dig the way that you move
You shake it down to your roots
Did your momma teach you how to do that thing you do
Yeah, nothing sweeter than wild
I’ll take a sip of that smile

You little homegrown honey, honey, honey
You’re so money, money, money

You’re so money, money, money
You got a country road Carolina soul
Baby you’re just so homegrown"
Darius Rucker,Don’t,"[Verse 1]
If you think I could ever go a day without you
Five minutes without thinkin' about you
Don't
And if you wonder if it scares me
Thinkin' about forever with you, baby
I can tell you, baby, it don't, oh

[Chorus]
'Cause every single mornin'
My eyes fall open on you
It's like my dreams keep goin'
On and on and on, it don't
Matter what we're doin'
As long as I'm with you, and
I can't imagine anything
I couldn't love you through the bad days
There's gonna be mistakes
But, baby, I'm here to stay
And if you think that could change
Don't

[Verse 2]
Stop makin' me late for work
Wakin' me up without sayin' a word
Ooh, don't
'Cause when you whisper in my ear
Everything I wanna hear
I know you know, I need to go
But you're the reason that I don't

'Cause every single mornin'
My eyes fall open on you
It's like my dreams keep goin'
On and on and on, it don't
Matter what we're doin'

I can't imagine anything
I couldn't love you through the bad days
There's gonna be mistakes
But, baby, I'm here to stay
And if you think that could change
Don't
Oh, baby, don't

Oh, and if you ever wonder
If I regret the day I said, ""I do""
Don't

'Cause every single mornin'
My eyes fall open on you
It's like my dreams keep goin'
On and on and on, it don't
Matter what we're doin'
As long as I'm with you, and

Darius Rucker,Life’s Too Short,"Mmm that breeze feels good, don't it?
Feet up on the cooler
Them tunes pouring out of that sliding rear window
Laugh to the beat of that tape deck radio
Mmm it's a heaven on earth moment
Got a good thing going
Round and round like the wheels of this night
It's a singing along kiss, close your eyes

I don't like this living, I love it
Sweet magnolia blue skies up above it
I don't call Carolina just a place I visit
I call Carolina home
I don't like drinking beer, I love it
On the back porch swinging with my honey
Life's too short just to like it so you better get to loving
This living before it's gone
Life's too short

Better get to living if the beer's ice cold
You better get to sipping if the song's in the air
Get you out a lighter if the party's rocking
You pull an all-nighter cause life's too short

Mmm that six string's strumming, ain't it?
This scene's all God painted
I'm soaking you in while you're soaking it in
It's like a movie baby, ain't it? Oh don't waste it

I don't like this living, I love it
Sweet magnolia blue skies up above it
I don't call Carolina just a place I visit
I call Carolina home
I don't like drinking beer, I love it
On the back porch swinging with my honey
Life's too short just to like it so you better get to loving
This living before it's gone
Life's too short

Better get to living if the beer's ice cold
You better get to sipping if the song's in the air
Get you out a lighter if the party's rocking
You pull an all-nighter cause life's too short

Oh
You better get to pouring
Oh
Cause life's too short now

I don't like this living, I love it
Sweet magnolia blue skies up above it
I don't call Carolina just a place I visit
I call Carolina home
I don't like drinking beer, I love it
On the back porch swinging with my honey
Life's too short just to like it so you better get to loving
This living before it's gone
Life's too short

Yeah you better get to living (The beer's ice cold)
Oh you gotta get to sipping (The song's in the air)
I'm gonna get you out a lighter (The party's rocking)
Girl you gotta pull an all-nighter cause life's too short"
Darius Rucker,"You’re a Mean One, Mr. Grinch","You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch
You really are a heel
You're as cuddly as a cactus
You're as charming as an eel, Mr. Grinch
You're a bad banana with a greasy black peel!
You're a monster, Mr. Grinch
Your heart's an empty hole
Your brain is full of spiders
You've got garlic in your soul, Mr. Grinch
I wouldn't touch you with a thirty-nine-and-a-half foot pole!

You're a foul one, Mr. Grinch
You have termites in your smile
You have all the tender sweetness
Of a seasick crocodile, Mr. Grinch
Given the choice between the two of you
I'd take the seasick crocodile!

You're a foul one, Mr. Grinch
You're a nasty wasty skunk
Your heart is full of unwashed socks
Your soul is full of gunk, Mr. Grinch
The three words that best describe you are as follows, and I quote
""Stink, stank, stunk!""

You're a rotter, Mr. Grinch
You're the king of sinful sots
Your heart's a dead tomato splotched
With moldy purple spots, Mr. Grinch
Your soul is an appalling dump heap
Overflowing with the most disgraceful assortment of deplorable rubbish imaginable
Mangled up in tangled up knots!
You nauseate me, Mr. Grinch
With a nauseous super ""naus""
You're a crooked dirty jockey
And you drive a crooked horse, Mr. Grinch
You're a three-decker sauerkraut
And toadstool sandwich with arsenic sauce!"
Darius Rucker,Fires Don’t Start Themselves,"[Verse 1]
We don't get too many nights
All alone, peace and quiet
Call it busy, call it a life
And I don't tell you near enough
Just how much I'm missing us
And making that temperature rise
But girl, I'm gonna show you tonight

[Chorus]
So, let's drink what's left of this bottle of wine
Move a little closer 'til the sparks start flyin'
Turn the lights down low and pull the Conway off of the shelf
Then we'll dance through the kitchen and straight down the hall
Let my old blue jeans and your sundress fall
Girl, we're holding the lighter
And fires don't start themselves

[Verse 2]
Well, I wanna take my time
Love you slow, love you right
Shadows dancing on the wall
Your lips, your hips, your fingertips
Every inch of you just fits
Like the shirt that I got on
Gonna love you, baby, all night long

[Chorus]
So, let's drink what's left of this bottle of wine
Move a little closer 'til the sparks start flyin'
Turn the lights down low and pull the Conway off of the shelf
Then we'll dance through the kitchen and straight down the hall
Let my old blue jeans and your sundress fall
Girl, we're holding the lighter
And fires don't start themselves
No, fires don't start themselves

[Bridge]
No, there ain't no putting it out
Might just burn this whole place down
Starting right now

[Chorus]
So, let's drink what's left of this bottle of wine
Move a little closer 'til the sparks start flyin'
Turn the lights down low and pull the Conway off of the shelf (Oh yeah)
Then we'll dance through the kitchen and straight down the hall
Let my old blue jeans and your sundress fall
Girl, we're holding the lighter
And fires don't start themselves, no, no
Fires don't start themselves
Ah, ah, oh"
Darius Rucker,This Is My World,"[Intro]
The look on your face
It could never explain your heart
And the touch of my lips
It could never tell you my thoughts

[Verse 1]
And you want me to change
I can't get used to
All you want me to be
I just can't pretend
To be anyone else
Cause it's not really me

[Pre-Chorus]
This is my world
This is who I am
And I'm not gonna give up myself
To make your life better

[Chorus]
She said
This is how it is
I got my own life to live
And you can either accept me
Or baby

[Verse 2]
And if it's love
That we share
Then we can withstand all
The obstacles that life brings forth
And I will receive you
For who you are who you were
And baby who U will be

[Verse 3]
But you want me to change
Girl I can't get used to
All you want me to be
And I just can't pretend
To be anyone else, oh
Cause it's not really me

[Pre-Chorus]

[Bridge]
This is how it is
I got my own life to live
And you can either accept me
Or baby

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
You said I promise you the stars
And I'm
Giving you all I can now
You said love is not enough
And I know
You will see
If your life turns around
In my heart there is room for you

[Pre-Chorus]


[Chorus]

[Pre-Chorus]

[Verse 5]
Oh, this is how
And I got my life
And you can either accept me
Or baby let me go

This is my world
My world
Baby let me go

Oh, this is who I am
Where I live
Got my own life to give

[Outro]
Oh, oh oh
My world
I'm not trying to change you
This is who I am
Please let me be me, yeah"
Darius Rucker,Radio,"[Verse 1]
Seventeen, the only way I had a car
Is after I dropped my mama off where she needed to go
Four bald tires, with the ceiling fallin' and the window stuck
But the only thing I cared about was the radio
We'd turn it on, turn it up to ten, and everybody would jump on in

[Chorus]
Riding down the highway
Who wants to be the DJ
I'll find a spot on the side of the road
You find something on the radio
Like a feel-real good song
We'll know it when it comes on
Didn't have no money, no place to go
All we needed was a radio

[Verse 2]
I'd grab my girl, we'd look for somewhere to watch the stars
The perfect place to put it in park and take it slow
She'd sing along, to even the ones that she barely knew
She still sounded good, a little out of tune, but we didn't care
I'd look at her, she'd look at me, I'll never forget that melody

[Chorus]
Riding down the highway
Who wants to be the DJ
I'll find a spot on the side of the road
You find something on the radio
Like a feel real good song
We'll know it when it comes on
Didn't have no money, no place to go
All we needed was a radio

[Verse 3]
Shhh, hey y'all be quiet
That's my favorite song
Hey man turn it up loud
Come on, come on, come on

[Chorus]
Riding down the highway
Who wants to be the DJ
I'll find a spot on the side of the road
You find something on the radio
Like a feel-real good song
We'll know it when it comes on
Didn't have no money, no place to go
All we needed was a radio

[Outro]
All we needed, all we needed now
Was a, was a, was a radio"
Darius Rucker,Never Been Over,"[Verse 1]
We've been good and bad, hot and cold
And fightin' mad, solid gold
Been sunny days, straight line wind
Been driven slow and guilty as sin

[Verse 2]
Been backroads lost and blue lights found
Dead of quiet, rockstar loud
Been up and down like we’re built on springs
We've been a lot of things

[Chorus]
But we've never been splittin' up friends, splittin' up records
Puttin' up walls, burnin' down letters
Grass is greener 'cause there's something better
Waitin' down the line
We've never been a headlights-weaving, taillights fadin'
So long, move on, goodbye waitin'
Never been one last long look across your shoulder
We'vе been a lot of things, but we've nevеr been over

[Verse 3]
We've been two pink lines to up all night
Brake on the left, gas on the right
Been eighteen years around the sun
Knowing that day will come

[Chorus]
But we've never been splittin' up friends, splittin' up records
Puttin' up walls, burnin' down letters
Grass is greener 'cause there's something better
Waitin' down the line
We've never been a headlights weaving, taillights fadin'
So long, move on, goodbye waitin'
Never been one last long look across your shoulder
We've been a lot of things, but we've never been over

[Bridge]
We've been holdin' onto love so long
That we don't know how to run

[Chorus]
But we've never been splittin' up friends, splittin' up records
Puttin' up walls, burnin' down letters
Grass is greener 'cause there's something better
Waitin' down the line
We've never been a headlights weaving, taillights fadin'
So long, move on, goodbye waitin'
Never been one last long look across your shoulder
We’ve been a lot of things
We’ve been a lot of things
We’ve been a lot of things, but we’ve never been over"
Darius Rucker,Bring It On,"Bring your wild, bring your innocence
Bring that smile when you bite your lip
Bring that two-glass tipsy kiss
That stayed just a little too long
Baby, bring on your little short fuse
Your ""can you carry my high heel shoes?""
Your little small town attitude
Makes me feel right at home

Bring it on, bring it on
Bring the fire, bring the storm
All your love like a flood
Raining down on me
Bring that laugh, bring those stars
Bring your jagged little heart
All those pieces of you
I ain't scared to love you
Baby bring it on
Baby bring it on

Come on with your heart on your sleeve
That makeup that you don't need
That angel that you don't see
When you look in the mirror
Bring your future, bring your past
Bring your ""scared to fall too fast""
All those perfect imperfections
Bring that girl I gotta have

Bring it on, bring it on
Bring the fire, bring the storm
All your love like a flood
Raining down on me
Bring that laugh, bring those stars
Bring your jagged little heart
All those pieces of you
I ain't scared to love you
Baby bring it on

Gotta love them back, go ahead just fall
Everything you have, girl, I want it all
Put your hand in mine, let me hold your heart
Baby let me see everything you are

Baby bring it on, bring it on
Bring the fire, bring the storm
All your love like a flood
Raining down on me
Bring that laugh, bring those stars
Bring your jagged little heart
All those pieces of you
I ain't scared to love you
Baby bring it on
Oh (baby bring it on)

Bring that smile when you bite your lip
Bring that two-glass tipsy kiss
Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on
Baby bring on your little short fuse
Your small town attitude
Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on
Bring it on, bring it on"
Darius Rucker,What God Wants for Christmas,"Old man playing Santa Claus
Blue in a town with old Jack Frost
Now he's handing out candy canes and smiles for free
People scoring with their lists
Rushing around to buy those gifts that will
End up wrapped up underneath the tree
I'm sitting at this red light looking at a manger scene
Watching snowflakes kiss that baby
And it makes me think

I wonder what God wants for Christmas
Something that you can't find in a store
Maybe peace on Earth, no more empty seats in church
Might be what's on His wishlist
I wonder what God wants for Christmas

What do you give someone
Who give His only Son
What if we believe in Him
Like He belives in us

I wonder what God wants for Christmas
What might put a smile on His face
Every bubble with no dust, the devil given up
Might be what's on His wishlist

I wonder what God wants for Christmas
What kind of gift from you and me
More sister, more brother, more lovin' one another
Yean I wonder, I wonder what God wants
By now we ought a know what God wants for Christmas"
Darius Rucker,She,"She could've been born and raised in a Kentucky blue grass town
East Carolina, South Alabama
Anywhere you might hear a screen door slam
In a doublewide or a little white house her daddy built
By a cotton, corn or a tobacco field
Green grass growing up around that Oldsmobile out in the yard
The one her Uncle Bobby took apart
Anybody's guess if and when
It'll ever get put together again

Yeah she's old black water
She's southern comfort
She's sweet magnolia sugar cane
Yeah she's every jet trail sky
There's wild horses in her eyes
And her heart you know you'd love to try and tame

She's probably got saved on a red oak Baptist back road pew
Summers in the sun at Waterloo
Whiskey bonfire buzz, yeah she's had a few
And she's just like you
Midnight singin' with the windows down
Slip string driftin' down a road she found
The kind of girl that makes your world go around

And she's old black water
She's southern comfort
She's sweet magnolia sugar cane
Yeah she's every jet trail sky
There's wild horses in her eyes
And her heart you know you'd love to try and tame

Yeah she's old black water
She's southern comfort
She's sweet magnolia sugar cane
Yeah she's every jet trail sky
There's wild horses in her eyes
And her heart you know you'd love to try and tame

On a sunset back road taillights drift away

Yeah she's old black water
She's southern comfort
She's sweet magnolia sugar cane
Yeah she's every jet trail sky
There's wild horses in her eyes
And her heart you know you'd love to try and tame"
Darius Rucker,True Believers,"[Verse 1]
Church bells ringing on our wedding day
Climbed in that limo and rode away
Guess you'll always hear some people say
Man, they're never going to make it

We settled in and we settled down
In this quiet little seaside town
You are the rock I built my world around
And life will never break it

[Chorus]
We are one heartbeat in the darkness
We are one lasting answered prayer
We are one unbroken promise
And we are two, true believers

[Verse 2]
It wasn't easy getting here today
Sometimes you stumbled or I lost my way
But every roadblock was a chance to say
Take my hand I'm here beside you

We worked and made it through the toughest parts
Now every day is another chance to start
To look around and see where we are
It's where we were trying to get to

[Chorus]
We are one heartbeat in the darkness
We are one lasting answered prayer
We are one unbroken promise
And we are two, true believers

[Verse 3]
We are one before our God in Heaven
Oh, we are one road when the going gets rough
We are one now and forever
We are one name, one life, one flame

[Chorus]
We are one heartbeat in the darkness
We are one lasting answered prayer
We are one unbroken promise
And we are two, true believers"
Darius Rucker,Southern Style,"[Verse 1]
Sun kissed hair and not much makeup
High-heeled boots that lace up
Two first names that came from
Her grandmas on both sides
She ain't ever read much Faulkner
But she could've been his daughter
She grew up on muddy water
Southern style

[Chorus]
Southern style, free and easy
Southern style, warm and breezy
If you met her, man believe me
You'd want her to stay a while
Says, she don't believe in strangers
Only sinners with a savior
Cause her mom and daddy raised her
Southern style

[Verse 2]
She's a Friday night light lover
A Billy Graham fan like her mother
Wants her daddy and both brothers
To walk her down the aisle
She likes oysters raw for dinner
A little Wayne and Lynyrd Skynyrd
Keeps her tan lines in the winter
Southern style

[Chorus]
Southern style, free and easy
Southern style, warm and breezy
If you met her, man believe me
You'd want her to stay a while
Says, she don't believe in strangers
Only sinners with a savior
Cause her mom and daddy raised her
Southern style

[Instrumental Break]

Southern style, free and easy
Southern style, warm and breezy
If you met her, man believe me
You'd want her to stay a while
She says, she don't believe in strangers
Only sinners with a savior
Cause her mom and daddy raised her
Southern style

[Outro]
You can love her, you can hate her
But you're never going to change her
If you want her then you'll take her
Southern style
Southern style
Southern style

Vern Gosdin,If Jesus Comes Tomorrow (What Then),"If Jesus comes tomorrow to spend some time with you
Would you answer all His questions or lie to hide the truth
Would you welcome Him with open arms or even let Him in
If Jesus comes tomorrow what then

If Jesus calls your number could you leave today
Are you ready to lay down your worldly goods and walk away
Would it take a month of Sundays just to tell Him of your sin
If Jesus comes tomorrow what then

If the sky turns black as midnight in the middle of the day
And somehow you knew that Jesus would soon be on His way
Would you have to beg forgiveness or could you reach out and take His hand
If Jesus comes tomorrow what then"
Vern Gosdin,"Jesus, Hold My Hand","As I travel through this pilgrim land
There is a friend, who walks with me
Leads me safely through the sinking sand
It is the Christ of Calvary

This would be my prayer dear Lord each day
To help me do the best I can
For I need the light to guide me day and night
Blessed Jesus hold my hand


Jesus, hold my hand, I need, thee every hour
Through, this pilgrim land, protect me by Thy power
Hear my feeble plea, O Lord, look down on me
*When I kneel in prayer I hope to meet you there
*Blessed Jesus hold my hand
Instrumental – Follow pattern of last two lines in Chorus*
Let me travel in the light divine
That I may see, the blessed way
Keep me that I may be wholly Thine
And sing redemption's song some day
I will be a soldier brave and true
And ever firmly take a stand
As I onward go and daily meet the foe
Blessed Jesus hold my hand
Repeat Chorus
When I kneel in prayer I hope to meet you there
Blessed Jesus hold my hand"
Vern Gosdin,Set ’Em Up Joe,"They got a vintage Victrola 1951
Full of my favorite records that I grew up on
They got ole Hank and Lefty and there's B24
Set 'em up Joe, and play 'Walking The Floor'
Set 'em up Joe, and play 'Walking The Floor'
I'm gonna spend the night like every night before
Playin' ET and I'll play him some more
I've gotta have a shot of them old troubadours

Set 'em up Joe, and play 'Walking The Floor'
Set 'em up Joe, and play 'Walking The Floor'

All my neon neighbors they like what I play
Cause they've heard it every night since you've walked away
Every day they replace old B24
'Cause every night I run a needle through 'Walking The Floor'

Every night I run a needle through 'Walking The Floor'
I'm gonna spend the night like every night before
Playin' ET and I'll play him some more
I've gotta have a shot of them old troubadours

Set 'em up Joe, and play 'Walking The Floor'
Set 'em up Joe, and play 'Walking The Floor'
I said set 'em up Joe, and play 'Walking The Floor'"
Vern Gosdin,I’m Gonna Be Movin’,"This old world is no place for livin'
Not enough care, not enough givin'
Sometime clouds of sin and sorrow hide the way
But this life of stormy weather
Ain't gonna be my home forever
Gonna be movin' - one of these days
I'm gonna be movin' - movin' away
Gonna be movin' - one of these days
When I leave this life behind me
Troubles and cares are never gonna find me
Gonna be movin' - one of these days
There won't be any time for cryin'
No more sickness, toil or dyin
Joy awaits me in that mansion far away
When I rest from all my labor
The Lord's gonna be my next door neighbor
Gonna be movin' - one of these days
I'm gonna be movin' - movin' away
Gonna be movin' - one of these days
When I leave this life behind me
Troubles and cares are never gonna find me
Gonna be movin' - one of these days"
Vern Gosdin,"Dim Lights, Thick Smoke (And Loud, Loud Music)","Dim lights, thick smoke and loud, loud music
Is the only kind of life you'll ever understand
Dim lights, thick smoke and loud, loud music
You'll never make a wife to a home loving man

A home and little children mean nothing to you
A house filled with love and a husband so true
You'd rather have a drink with the first guy you meet
The only home you know is that bar down the street

Dim lights, thick smoke and loud, loud music
Is the only kind of life you'll ever understand
Dim lights, thick smoke and loud, loud music
You'll never make a wife to a home loving man

Drinking and dancing, to a honky tonk band
Is the only kind of life you'll ever understand
Go run and have your fun, you think you played it smart
I'm sorry for you and your honky tonk heart"
Vern Gosdin,Chiseled In Stone,"You ran cryin' to the bedroom
I ran off to the bar
Another piece of heaven gone to hell
The words we spoke in anger
Just tore my world apart
And I sat there feeling sorry for myself

Then that old man sat down beside me
And looked me in the eye
And said ""Son, I know what you're going through
You ought to get down on your knees
And thank your lucky stars that you got someone to go home to.""

(Chorus)
You don't know about lonely
Or how long nights can be
Till you lived through the story
That's still livin' in me
And you don't know about sadness
'til you faced life alone
You don't know about lonely
'til it's chiseled in stone

So I brought these pretty flowers
Hoping you would understand
Sometimes a man is such a fool
Those golden words of wisdom
From the heart of that old man
Showed me I ain't nothing without you

You don't know about lonely
Or how long nights can be
Till you lived through the story
That old man just told me
And you don't know about sadness
'til you faced life alone
You don't know about lonely
'til it's chiseled in stone
You don't know about lonely
'til it's chiseled in stone"
Vern Gosdin,Dream of Me,"My life on the road has always been hard on me and you
And every time we say goodbye, it gets harder to do
But when I'm far away somewhere alone and the missin' you starts
All I got to do is picture you and I can feel you in my heart
So dream of me every time you get to feelin' blue
Dream of me and I'll be dreaming of you
I've been a lot of places but there's just no place like home
And I'm always on my way back to you every minute that I'm gone
So when you get to feelin' lonely just remember we won't always be apart
Close your eyes and think of me and you can feel me in your heart
So dream of me every time you get to feelin' blue
Dream of me and I'll be dreaming of you
So dream of me every time you get to feelin' blue
Dream of me and I'll be dreaming of you"
Vern Gosdin,Praying,"They were prayin’
Prayin’ for someone like me
Not long ago, I was thinkin’ of home
And I wondered if Mama was there all alone
I thought I'd drop by, as I had before
But the sound from within made me stop at the door
She was prayin’, a sound that the world seldom hears
Prayin’ her words were pleading and clear
The sound of her voice, as she spoke my name
Brought tears to my eyes, my heart filled with shame
She was prayin’, prayin’ for someone like me
Walkin’ one night, I felt so alone
My heart was so heavy from the trouble I’ve known
I hadn’t noticed, a church that was near
‘Til the sound from within seem to fill the air
They were prayin’, a sound that the world seldom hears
Prayin’, the children that God loves so dear
Outside in the darkness, I could not see
But I could picture them down on their knees
Prayin’, prayin’ for someone like me"
Vern Gosdin,Do You Believe Me Now,"[Verse 1]
Don't you think you should have called to tell me you were coming down?
Oh, you look so out of place on this troubled side of town
It's a place where losers go when they know there's nothing left
And after losing you, I just lost the will to live

[Chorus]
Do you believe me now?
I told you time and time again
My heart and soul is your hands
Do you believe me now?
Do you believe me now?
Look at the living, dying proof
I ain't nothing without you
Do you believe me now?

[Verse 2]
I don't know what changed your mind, I won't ask if this is real
I don't know if you're a dream, I only know how good it feels
If you could find it in your heart to say the fire for me still burns
I'll find a place to turn around down this road of no return

[Chorus]
Do you believe me now?
I told you time and time again
My heart and soul is your hands
Do you believe me now?
Do you believe me now?
Look at the living, dying proof
I ain't nothing without you
Do you believe me now?"
Vern Gosdin,Is It Raining At Your House,"Is it raining at your house like it's raining at mine
Do you miss me like I miss you, is it cloudy all the time
Do you tremble when the phone rings and you think I'm on the line
Is it raining at your house like it's raining at mine

Does it thunder and lightnin' even when the sun shines
Is it raining at your house like it's raining at mine

Is it raining at your place just like it is over here
If it is then sweetheart like me I know you're scared
I just called you to console you like any old friend would do
Is it raining at your house and by the way, I still love you"
Vern Gosdin,Till The End,"If I never see your loving face again
I'll go on loving you till the end
And if my broken hearted love don't find a way to mend
I'll go on loving you till the end

The years and miles may separate you from me
The pain may lessen more as time goes by
But as for me memories will never fade
And I'll go on loving you till the end

If we're ever free to love again I know

Straight to your waiting arms is where I'll go
And there's I'll stay forever and I'll prove to you again
I'll go on loving you till the end
I'll go on loving you till the end"
Vern Gosdin,If You’re Gonna Do Me Wrong (Do Me Right),"[Verse 1]
There's a closet full of dresses that I bought you
And here's the keys to the new car in the drive
And before you leave our room, put on your best perfume
If you're gonna do me wrong, do it right

[Verse 2]
Ohh, the next time the phone rings, I won't answer
I don't wanna be the fool I was tonight
I don't wanna know the truth, I don't wanna see the proof
If you're gonna do me wrong, do it right

[Chorus]
If you're gonna break my heart all to pieces
Just walk right out and leave me and end it all tonight
Take off your wedding band, when he takes you by the hand
If you're gonna do me wrong, do it right

[Outro]
Take off your wedding band, when he takes you by the hand
If you're gonna do me wrong, do it right"
Vern Gosdin,That Just About Does It,"Every night you go to bed crying
There's nothing left to do when love is dying
So before the whole world knows how we're hurtin
Don't you think it's time we pulled the curtains

So many times I talked you out of leavin'
And so many times you've tried to fight the feeling
I guess we've tried and failed once too often
Now the suitcase down the hallway does the talking

That just about does it, don't it
That'll just about kill it, won't it
Maybe we should call a truce
We could but what's the use?
That just about does it, don't it

It's sad to think that words could come between us
And what I said, God knows, I didn't mean it
It's time we realized this time it's over
It's tearing us apart to stay together

And that just about does it, don't it
That'll just about kill it, won't it
Maybe we should call a truce
We could but what's the use?
That just about does it, don't it

Maybe we should call a truce
We could but what's the use?
That just about does it, don't it"
Vern Gosdin,Just Enough To Keep Me Hangin’ On,"It's true you have me twisted around your finger
It seems that's where I belong
You know how to hold me to thrill me and control me
Just enough to keep me a hanging on  ah-ha-ah
Just enough to keep me a hanging on

My heart is like a yo-yo on a string
I'm tied to you right or wrong
My love keeps a growing cause your love keeps a showing
Just enough to keep me a hanging on  ah-ha-ah
Just enough to keep me a hanging on

A love that's strong as mine will make me do most anything
Like hiding tears and heartaches and dreaming silly dreams
You've got me where you want me you keep stringing me along
Just enough to keep me a hanging on ah-ha-ah
Just enough to keep me a hanging on"
Vern Gosdin,Baby That’s Cold,"You said sit down here and listen
There is something that I need to say to you
Something here is missing
Just maybe you can tell me what to do

I felt the hurt start crawling
As I waited for the other shoe to fall
Then you looked at me and told me
You never really cared for me at all

Baby that's cold that really hurts
Down through my soul clear to the bone
It cut like a knife more than you know
That really hurts baby that's cold

Maybe someday I'll forget you
And with luck I'll get over you in time
I'll do anything I have to
To wash away your memory from my mind

It still tears my heart out to know
That you don't want me anymore
I've been through a lot of heartaches
But nothing's ever hurt that bad before

Baby that's cold that really hurts
Down through my soul clear to the bone
It cut like a knife more than you know
That really hurts baby that's cold

That really hurts baby that's cold"
Vern Gosdin,Rainbows And Roses,"You’re as warm as you are pretty
And you feel so good to hold
Every inch of you a lady
You’re a comfort to my soul
You’re my rainbows and roses
You’re all I ever need to see me through
You’re my rainbows and roses
And like a rose there’s only one of you
You make lovin’ you so easy
Just the way it ought to be
Heaven knows I love you Babe
You mean all the world to me
You’re my rainbows and roses
You’re all I ever need to see me through
You’re my rainbows and roses
And like a rose there’s only one of you
You’re my rainbows and roses"
Vern Gosdin,Way Down Deep,"This highway of heartache is rocky and rough
Lord, I learned a long time ago
You can't build a fire from the ashes of love
Roses don't bloom in the snow

Down deep inside my soul
Where once it was cold and dark
I feel your love take a-hold
Way down deep in my heart

You were my light on the darkest of days
Though storms that were raging within
And slowly but surely the clouds rolled away
And the sun started shining again

Down deep inside my soul
Where once it was cold and dark
I feel your love take a-hold
Way down deep in my heart

Down deep inside my soul
Where once it was cold and dark
I feel your love take a-hold
Way down deep in my heart

Down deep inside my soul
Where once it was cold and dark
I feel your love take a-hold
Way down deep in my heart"
Vern Gosdin,I’ll Fly Away,"I'll fly away, oh glory, I'll fly away
When I die, hallelujah by and by, I'll fly away
Some bright morning when this life is over, I'll fly away
To a land on God's celestial shore, I'll fly away
I'll fly away, oh glory, I'll fly away
When I die, hallelujah by and by, I'll fly away
When the shadows of this life have grown, I'll fly away
Like a bird from these prison walls, I'll fly away
I'll fly away, oh glory, I'll fly away
When I die, hallelujah by and by, I'll fly away
Oh how glad and happy when we meet, I'll fly away
No more cold iron shackles on my feet, I'll fly away
I'll fly away, oh glory, I'll fly away
When I die, hallelujah by and by, I'll fly away
Just a few more weary days and then, I'll fly away
To a land where joy will never end, I'll fly away
I'll fly away, oh glory, I'll fly away
When I die, hallellujah by and by, I'll fly away"
Vern Gosdin,The Other Side Of Life,"Praise God I feel like singing
I'm on the other side of life now
On a bed with sorrow and tears for my love ones
Oh I wish I could tell them all the joy that I feel
Though my body is weary my soul is up lifted
My sins are forgiven and my Jesus is near
Repeat #1
Though my eyes are dim I can see heaven clearly
Though my voice grows feeble I will sing just the same
In my heart there’s a song as I see the gates open
I'll sing forever in His joyous refrain"
Vern Gosdin,This Ain’t My First Rodeo,"You say your mama called and you must go
She's down in the bed and need you so
And you don't know if you'll be coming home tonight or not
But, honey ain't your mama sick a lot?

Lately, your head hurts every night
Could it be you wear your clothes too tight?
Since you don't seem to hear or see a thing I say or do
Then I know there's nothing I can do for you

This ain't my first rodeo
This ain't the first time this old cowboy's been throwed
This ain't the first I've seen this dog and pony show
This ain't my first rodeo

You're telling me you lost your wedding band
Somehow you say it slipped right off your hand
And when I asked about those boxes stacked there by the door
You say it's just some old things you don't wear no more

I didn't make it all the way through school
But my mama didn't raise any fool
I may not be the Einstein of our time
But honey, I'm not dumb and I'm not blind

This ain't my first rodeo
This ain't the first time this old cowboy's been throwed
This ain't the first I've seen this dog and pony show
Honey, this ain't my first rodeo

This ain't my first rodeo
This ain't the first time this old cowgirl's been throwed
This ain't the first I've seen this dog and pony show
Honey, this ain't my first rodeo
No, this ain't my first rodeo"
Vern Gosdin,Hangin’ On,"It's true you have me twisted around your finger
It seems that's where I belong
You know how to hold me to thrill me and control me
Just enough to keep me a hanging on ah-ha-ah
Just enough to keep me a hanging on

My heart is like a yo-yo on a string
I'm tied to you right or wrong
My love keeps a growing cause your love keeps a showing
Just enough to keep me a hanging on ah-ha-ah
Just enough to keep me a hanging on

A love that's strong as mine will make me do most anything
Like hiding tears and heartaches and dreaming silly dreams
You've got me where you want me you keep stringing me along
Just enough to keep me a hanging on ah-ha-ah
Just enough to keep me a hanging on"
Vern Gosdin,Stone Cold Heart,"It’s over this time, it’s the end of the line
And when you awake I’ll be gone
It’s plain now to see, there’s no room for me
In a heart that’s made of stone
There may come a day the world blows away
And mountains will crumble apart
But I know too well, all the fires of hell
Cannot melt your stone cold heart
Lyin’ close to you, turns me blue
When you turn away from my arms
Love is dyin’ to live, and I’m willin’ to give
But your heart has turned to stone
There may come a day the world blows away
And mountains will crumble apart
But I know too well, all the fires of hell
Cannot melt your stone cold heart
Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm …"
Vern Gosdin,I Wonder Where We’d Be Tonight,"Time is sure passin' slow
Lord, it's only half past ten
One too many times tonight
You just crossed my mind again

I just can't help but wonder
Why we had that final fight
And if we hadn't given up
I wonder where we'd be tonight

It's just about all that I can do
To keep from pickin' up the phone
'Cause I'm afraid that if you answer
I might find you're not alone

I can't stand the thought that someone else
Could make your world seem bright
And if we were still together, girl
I wonder where we'd be tonight

How would it be
Would you still love the way you used to
Would you believe in me
Could I still be inside the heart of you?

Would you take me in your lovin' arms
And make everything all right
And if we were still hangin' on
I wonder where we'd be tonight

I just can't get you off my mind
God I wonder where you are tonight..."
Vern Gosdin,I Can Tell By The Way You Dance (You’re Gonna Love Me Tonight),"I can see every time I look into your eyes
You don't care a thing about those other guys
Without words you make me understand what's on your mind
The rhythm of your body close to mine
I can tell by the way you dance
That you're gonna love me tonight
Sometimes it's cold sometimes it's hot
Love's either right or it's wrong
Feels so good, love you a lot
Right here beside me is where you belong
I don't care if everybody knows the way I feel
Until the dream of holding you is real
I can tell by the way you dance
That you're gonna love me tonight
Sometimes it's cold sometimes it's hot
Love's either right or it's wrong
Feels so good, love you a lot
Right here beside me is where you belong
I don't care if everybody knows the way I feel
Until the dream of holding you is real
I can tell by the way you dance
That you're gonna love me tonight
I can tell by the way you dance
That you're gonna love me tonight
I can tell by the way you dance
That you're gonna love me tonight
I can tell by the way you dance
That you're gonna love me tonight"
Vern Gosdin,Take Me Home To Alabama,"Alabama, Arkansas
I do love my Ma and Pa
Not the way that I do love you

Well, holy moly me oh my
You're the apple of my eye
Girl, I've never loved one like you

Man, oh, man, you're my best friend

- Yes, I do
- Well, there's something I never told you about that night
- What didn't you tell me?
- Well, while you were sitting in the back seat smoking a cigarette you thought was gonna be your last, I was falling deep, deeply in love with you, and I never told you till just now!

Home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you
Home, let me come home

Rascal Flatts,Life Is a Highway,"[Intro]
Woo
Mm, yeah

[Verse 1]
Life's like a road that you travel on
When there's one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There's a world outside every darkened door
Where blues won't haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore

[Pre-Chorus 1]
We won't hesitate
To break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today, yeah

[Chorus]
Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
If you're goin' my way
Well, I wanna drive it all night long

[Verse 2]
Through all these cities and all these towns
It's in my blood and it's all around
I love you now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the hands
From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights
Knock me down, I'm back up again
You're in my blood, I'm not a lonely man

[Pre-Chorus 2]
There's no load I can't hold
A road so rough, this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Just tell 'em we're survivors

[Chorus]
Life is a highway
Well, I wanna ride it all night long (Woo)
If you're goin' my way
I wanna drive it all night long (All night long)
A gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, yeah
Life is a highway
Well, I wanna ride it all night long (Mm, yeah)
If you're goin' my way (You're goin' my way)
I wanna drive it all night long (All night long)

[Bridge]
There was a distance between you and I (Between you and I)
A misunderstanding once
But now we look it in the eye
Ooh, yeah (Mm, yeah)

[Instrumental Break]

[Refrain]
There ain't no load that I can't hold
The roads are rough, this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Tell 'em we're survivors

[Chorus]
Life is a highway
Well, I wanna ride it all night long (All night long, yeah)
If you're goin' my way
Well, I wanna drive it all night long (A gimme, gimme, gimme, a gimme, gimme, yeah)
Life is a highway (Life is a highway)
I wanna ride it all night long (Woo, yeah)
If you're goin' my way (You're goin' my way)
I wanna drive it all night long (All night long, yeah; come on, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, yeah)
Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long (Yeah, I wanna drive it all night long, baby)
If you're goin' my way (You're goin' my way)
I wanna drive it all night long (All night long)"
Rascal Flatts,Bless the Broken Road,"[Verse 1]
I set out on a narrow way many years ago
Hoping I would find true love along the broken road
But I got lost a time or two
Wiped my brow and kept pushing through
I couldn't see how every sign pointed straight to you

[Chorus]
That every long lost dream led me to where you are
Others who broke my heart, they were like Northern stars
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road that led me straight to you
(Yes, he did)

[Verse 2]
I think about the years I spent just passing through
I'd like to have the time I lost and give it back to you
But you just smile and take my hand
You've been there, you understand
It's all part of a grander plan that is coming true

[Chorus]
Every long lost dream led me to where you are
Others who broke my heart, they were like Northern stars
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road that led me straight to you, ooh
Yeah

[Bridge]
And now I'm just rolling home
Into my lover's arms
This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road that led me straight to you

[Outro]
That God blessed the broken road
That led me straight to you
Ooh, mm"
Rascal Flatts,My Wish,"[Intro]
Ooh

[Verse 1]
I hope that the days come easy and the moments pass slow
And each road leads you where you wanna go
And if you're faced with a choice and you have to choose
I hope you choose the one that means the most to you
And if one door opens to another door closed
I hope you keep on walkin' 'till you find the window
If it's cold outside, show the world the warmth of your smile
But more than anything, more than anything

[Chorus]
My wish for you is that this life becomes all that you want it to
Your dreams stay big, your worries stay small
You never need to carry more than you can hold
And while you're out there gettin' where you're gettin' to
I hope you know somebody loves you and wants the same things, too
Yeah, this is my wish

[Verse 2]
I hope you never look back, but you never forget
All the ones who love you and the place you left
I hope you always forgive and you never regret
And you help somebody every chance you get
Oh, you'd find God's grace in every mistake
And always give more than you take
But more than anything (More than anything)
Yeah, more than anything

[Chorus]
My wish for you is that this life becomes all that you want it to
Your dreams stay big, your worries stay small
You never need to carry more than you can hold
And while you're out there gettin' where you're gettin' to
I hope you know somebody loves you and wants the same things, too
Yeah, this is my wish
Yeah, yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
My wish for you is that this life becomes all that you want it to
Your dreams stay big, your worries stay small
You never need to carry more than you can hold
And while you're out there gettin' where you're gettin' to
I hope you know somebody loves you and wants the same things, too
Yeah, this is my wish (My wish for you)

[Outro]
This is my wish (My wish for you)
I hope you know somebody loves you (My wish for you)
May all your dreams stay big (My wish for you)"
Rascal Flatts,What Hurts The Most,"[Verse 1]
I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house
That don't bother me
I can take a few tears now and then and just let 'em out
I’m not afraid to cry every once in a while
Even though goin' on with you gone still upsets me
There are days every now and again I pretend I’m okay
But that’s not what gets me

[Chorus]
What hurts the most
Was being so close
And havin' so much to say
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowin’
What could've been
And not seein' that loving you
Is what I was tryin' to do

[Verse 2]
It’s hard to deal with the pain of losin' you everywhere I go
But I’m doin’ it
It’s hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I’m alone
Still harder gettin' up, gettin' dressed, livin' with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart (Trade it)
That I left unspoken

[Chorus]
What hurts the most
Is being so close
And havin' so much to say (Much to say)
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowin'
What could've been
And not seeing that loving you
Is what I was tryin' to do, oh

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, yeah
Woo

[Chorus]
What hurts the most
Was being so close
And havin' so much to say (Much to say)
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowin'
What could have been
And not seeing that loving you
Is what I was tryin' to do

[Outro]
Not seeing that loving you
That’s what I was trying to do
Ooh"
Rascal Flatts,Yours If You Want It,"[Verse 1]
There's one more sip in this bottle of wine
A lonely star hangin' in the sky with a wish left on it
And it's yours if you want it
And this wildflower from the neighbor's yard
A real slow dance in the moonlight dark
This hand in my pocket
Oh baby, just call it
Cause it's yours if you want it

[Chorus]
And every bit of love left in this beat up, banged up, scarred up heart
That's been waitin' on a girl like you
I know it ain't much
But it comes alive with every touch
Every kiss already feels like you own it
Baby, it's yours if you want it

[Verse 2]
Half of this rickety front porch swing
Every word of every song I sing
My jacket when it's cold
Oh baby, don't you know?
You've got a place to lay your head
On the other side of my empty bed
And it's just made for fallin'
And it's yours if you want it
It's yours if you want it

[Chorus]
And every bit of love left in this beat up, banged up, scarred up heart
That's been waitin' on a girl like you
I know it ain't much
But it comes alive with every touch
Every kiss already feels like you own it
Baby, it's yours if you want it

[Post-Chorus]
It's yours if you want it

[Bridge]
Every dollar, every dime, every drop of rain, every single thing I could beg, steal, or borrow
Every yesterday and tomorrow
Well every grain of sand on the beach
Every blade of grass under our feet
Baby, your name is written on it
And it's yours if you want it

[Chorus]
And every bit of love left in this beat up, banged up, scarred up heart
That's been waitin' on a girl like you
And I know it ain't much
But it comes alive with every touch
Every kiss already feels like you own it
Baby it's yours if you want it

[Outro]
Oh, oh
I swear, every dollar, every dime, every drop of rain, every single thing
That I could beg, steal, or borrow
Baby, your name is written on it
Baby, it's yours if you want it"
Rascal Flatts,Fast Cars and Freedom,"[Intro]
Mhm
Ooh, yeah
Mhm

[Verse 1]
Starin' at you takin' off your makeup
Wonderin' why you even put it on
I know you think you do, but baby, you don't need it
Wish that you could see what I see when it's gone

[Chorus]
I see a dust trail following an old red Nova
Baby blue eyes, your head on my shoulder
Wait, baby, don't move, right there it is
A T-shirt hangin' off a Dogwood Branch
That river was cold, but we gave love a chance
Yeah, yeah, to me
You don't look a day over fast cars and freedom
That sunset river bank, first time feelin'
Oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Yeah, smile and shake your head as if you don't believe me
I'll just sit right here and let you take me back
I'm on that gravel road, look at me
On my way to pick you up
You're standing on the front porch looking just like that
Remember that

[Chorus]
I see a dust trail following an old red Nova
Baby blue eyes, your head on my shoulder
Wait, baby, don't move, right there it is
A T-shirt hangin' off a Dogwood Branch
That river was cold, but we gave love a chance
Yeah, yeah, to me
You don't look a day over fast cars and freedom
That sunset river bank, first time feelin'

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I see a dust trail following an old red Nova
Baby blue eyes, your head on my shoulder
You don't look a day over fast cars and freedom
That sunset river bank, first time feelin'

[Outro]
I see a dust trail following an old red Nova (No, no, no)
Baby blue eyes, your head on my shoulder
(You don't look a day over fast cars and freedom)
A T-shirt hangin' off a Dogwood Branch (That river bank)
That river was cold, but we gave love a chance"
Rascal Flatts,Back to Life,"[Verse 1]
She got that ""hey y'all"" little southern drawl that she got from her mama
Likes coffee with her sugar in the morning
She likes to leave little red lipstick love notes on the mirror
Loves the rain on a tin roof when it's pouring

[Pre-Chorus]
Doesn't matter what we're listening to
Spinning her around the living room
And I fall apart every time

[Chorus]
She puts that beat in my chest
Pounds like a drum, shakes me like thunder
Taking my hand, pulling me up when I'm going under
My dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes
She brings me back to life
Yes, she does

[Verse 2]
She's got her feet on the dash
Hair blowing back, hand out the window
Making up half the words that she's singing
And she takes an hour to pick a  movie out
Five minutes in and she's passing out
And I wouldn't dare wake her up when she's sleeping

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd stay there forever if I could
Doing nothing never felt so good
And I wish that I could stop time

[Chorus]
She puts that beat in my chest
Pounds like a drum, shakes me like thunder
Taking my hand, pulling me up when I'm going under
My dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes
She brings me back to life
Oh, yes she does
And I don't wanna think about where I would be without her, oh
She puts that beat in my chest
Pounds like a drum, shakes me like thunder
Taking my hand, pulling me up when I'm going under
My dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes, whoa
Yeah, my dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes
She brings me back to life

[Outro]
Oh, she does
Back to life"
Rascal Flatts,I’m Movin’ On,"[Verse 1]
I've dealt with my ghosts and I've faced all my demons
Finally content with a past I regret
I've found you find strength in your moments of weakness
For once, I'm at peace with myself
I've been burdened with blame, trapped in the past for too long
I'm movin' on

[Verse 2]
I've lived in this place and I know all the faces
Each one is different, but they're always the same
They mean me no harm, but it's time that I face it
They'll never allow me to change
But I never dreamed home would end up where I don't belong
I'm movin' on

[Bridge]
I'm movin' on
At last I can see (At last I can see)
Life has been patiently waiting for me
And I know there's no guarantees, but I'm not alone
There comes a time in everyone's life
When all you can see are the years passing by (All the years passing by)
And I have made up my mind that those days are gone

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I sold what I could and packed what I couldn't
Stopped to fill up on my way out of town
I've loved like I should, but lived like I shouldn't
I had to lose everything to find out
Maybe forgiveness will find me somewhere down this road
I'm movin' on

[Outro]
I'm movin' on
I'm movin' on"
Rascal Flatts,These Days,"[Verse 1]
Hey baby, is that you?
Wow, your hair got so long
Yeah, yeah, I love it, I really do
""Norma Jean"", ain't that the song we'd sing in the car?
Driving downtown, top down, making the rounds
Checking out the bands on Doheeney Avenue
Yeah, life throws you curves
But you learned to swerve
Me, I swung and I missed and the next thing ya know
I'm reminiscing
Dreaming old dreams, wishing old wishes
Like you would be back again

[Chorus]
I wake up in teardrops that fall down like rain
I put on that old song we danced to and then
I head off to my job
Guess not much has changed
Punch the clock, head for home
Check the phone, just in case
Go to bed, dream of you
That's what I'm doing these days
Yeah, that's what I'm doing

[Verse 2]
Someone told me after college, you ran off to Vegas
You married a rodeo cowboy
Wow, that ain't the girl I knew
Me, I've been a few places
Mostly here and there, once or twice
Still sortin' out life, but I'm doing alright
Yeah, it's good to see you too
Well, hey girl, you're late
And those planes, they don't wait
But if you ever come back around this sleepy old town
Promise me you'll stop in to see an old friend
And until then...

[Chorus]
I wake up in teardrops that fall down like rain
I put on that old song we danced to and then
I head off to my job
Guess not much has changed
Punch the clock, head for home
Check the phone, just in case
Go to bed, dream of you
That's what I'm doing these days
These days

[Instrumental Break]
Baby

[Chorus]
I wake up in teardrops that fall down like rain
I put on that old song we danced to and then
I head off to my job
Guess not much has changed
Punch the clock, head for home
Check the phone, just in case
Go to bed, dream of you
That's what I'm doing these...
I wake up in teardrops that fall down like rain
I put on that old song we danced to and then
I wake up in teardrops that fall down like rain
I put on that old song we danced to and then
I wake up in teardrops that fall down like rain
I put on that old song we danced to and then"
Rascal Flatts,Backwards,"[Verse 1]
I was sitting on a bar stool
In a barbecue joint in Tennessee
When this old boy walked in
And he sat right down next to me
I could tell he'd been through some hard times
There were tear stains on his old shirt
Then he said, ""Do you wanna know what you get
When you play a country song backwards?""

[Chorus]
You get your house back
You get your dog back
You get your best friend Jack back
You get your truck back
You get your hair back
You get your first and second wives back
Your front porch swing
Your pretty little thing
Your bling, bling, bling, and a diamond ring
You get your farm and the barn and the boat and the Harley
First night in jail with Charlie
It sounds a little crazy, a little scattered and absurd
But that's what you get when you play a country song backwards

[Verse 2]
Well, I never heard it said quite like that
It hit me in the face cause that's where I'm at
I almost fell flat out on the floor
He said, ""Wait a minute, that's not all, there's even more""

[Chorus]
You get your mind back
You get your nerves back
Your first heart attack back
You get your pride back
You get your life back
You get your first real love back
You get your big screen TV, a DVD and a washing machine
You get the pond and the lawn and the bale and the mower
You go back where you don't know her
It sounds a little crazy (A little crazy), a little scattered and absurd
But that's what you get when you play a country song backwards
Oh, play that song
Woo

[Bridge]
We sat there and shot the bull about how it would be
If we could turn it all around and change this C-R-A-P

[Chorus]
You get your house back
You get your dog back
You get your best friend Jack back
You get your truck back
You get your hair back
You get your first and second wives back
Your front porch swing
Your pretty little thing
Your bling, bling, bling, and a diamond ring
You get the farm and the barn and the boat and the Harley
First night in jail with Charlie (Yeah)
You get your mind back
You get your nerves back
Your first heart attack back
You get your pride back
You get your life back
You get your first real love back (Oh)
You get your big screen TV, a DVD and a washing machine
You get the pond and the lawn and the bale and the mower
You go back where you don't know her
It sounds a little crazy (A little crazy), a little scattered and absurd
But that's what you get when you play a country song backwards

Hey"
Rascal Flatts,How They Remember You,"[Verse 1]
Sprayed my name on a water tower
Carved it in an old cottonwood tree
Signed a bunch of high school yearbooks
So they wouldn't forget about me
It wasn't 'til I saw my daddy's name in stone I knew
It ain't a question of if they will
It's how they remember you

[Chorus]
Did you stand or did you fall?
Build a bridge or build a wall
Hide your love or give it all
What did you do? What did you do?
Did you make 'em laugh or make 'em cry?
Did you quit or did you try?
Live your dreams or let 'em die?
What did you choose? What did you choose?
When it all comes down
It ain't if, it's how they remember you

[Verse 2]
When you're down to your last dollar
Will you give or will you take?
When the stiff wind blows the hardest
Will you bend or will you break? (Will you break?)
You're gonna leave a legacy, no matter what you do
It ain't a question of if they will
It's how they remember you

[Chorus]
Did you stand or did you fall?
Build a bridge or build a wall
Hide your love or give it all
What did you do? What did you do?
Did you make 'em laugh or make 'em cry?
Did you quit or did you try?
Live your dreams or let 'em die
What did you choose? What did you choose?
When it all comes down
It ain't if, it's how they remember you

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Did you make 'em laugh or make 'em cry?
Did you quit or did you try?
Live your dreams or let 'em die
What did you choose? (What did you choose?)
Oh, when it all comes down
It ain't if, it's how they remember you

[Outro]
How they, how they remember you
How they, how they remember you
How they, how they remember you (How they remember)
How they, how they remember you
How they, how they remember you
How they, how they remember you
How they, how they remember you (How they remember)
How they, how they remember you (How they remember you)"
Rascal Flatts,I Won’t Let Go,"[Verse 1]
It's like a storm
That cuts a path
It breaks your will
It feels like that
You think you're lost
But you're not lost
On your own
You're not alone

[Chorus]
I will stand by you
I will help you through
When you've done all you can do
And you can't cope
I will dry your eyes
I will fight your fight
I will hold you tight
And I won't let go

[Verse 2]
It hurts my heart
To see you cry
I know it's dark
This part of life
Oh, it finds us all
And we're too small
To stop the rain
Oh, but when it rains

[Chorus]
I will stand by you
I will help you through
When you've done all you can do
And you can't cope
I will dry your eyes
I will fight your fight
I will hold you tight
And I won't let you fall

[Bridge]
Don't be afraid to fall
I'm right here to catch you
I won't let you down
It won't get you down
You're gonna make it
Yeah, I know you can make it

[Chorus]
'Cause I will stand by you
I will help you through
When you've done all you can do
And you can't cope
And I will dry your eyes
I will fight your fight
I will hold you tight
And I won't let go

[Outro]
Oh, I'm gonna hold you
And I won't let go
Won't let you go
No, I won't"
Rascal Flatts,Here Comes Goodbye,"[Verse 1]
I can hear the truck tires coming up the gravel road
And it's not like her to drive that slow, nothin's on the radio
Footsteps on the front porch, I hear my doorbell
She usually comes right in, now I can tell

[Chorus]
Here comes goodbye
Here comes the last time
Here comes the start of every sleepless night
The first of every tear I'm gonna cry
Here comes the pain
Here comes me wishing things had never changed
And she was right here in my arms tonight, but here comes goodbye

[Verse 2]
I can hear her say I love you like it was yesterday
And I can see it written on her face that she had never felt this way
One day I thought I'd see her with her daddy by her side
And violins would play here comes the bride

[Chorus]
Here comes goodbye
Here comes the last time
Here comes the start of every sleepless night
The first of every tear I'm gonna cry
Here comes the pain
Here comes me wishing things had never changed
And she was right here in my arms tonight, but here comes goodbye

[Bridge]
Why does it have to go from good to gone?
Before the lights turn on, yeah and youre left alone
All alone, but here comes goodbye

[Chorus]
Here comes goodbye
Here comes the last time
Here comes the start of every sleepless night
The first of every tear I'm gonna cry
Here comes the pain
Here comes me wishing things had never changed
And she was right here in my arms tonight, but here comes goodbye"
Rascal Flatts,Why,"[Verse 1]
You must have been in a
Place so dark
You couldn't feel the light
Reachin' for you through
That stormy cloud
Now here we are
Gathered in our little hometown
This can't be the way
You meant to draw a crowd

[Chorus]
Oh why, that's what I keep asking
Was there anything I could've
Said or done
Oh, I had no clue you were masking
A troubled soul, God only knows
What went wrong and why
You would leave the stage
In the middle of a song

[Verse 2]
Now in my mind I'll keep you frozen
As a seventeen-year-old
Rounding third to score the winning run
You always played with passion
No matter what the game
When you took the stage
You'd shine just like the sun

[Chorus]
Oh why, that's what I keep asking
Was there anything I could've
Said or done
Oh, I had no clue you were masking
A troubled soul, , God only knows
What went wrong and why
You would leave the stage
In the middle of a song

[Bridge]
Now the oak trees are swaying
In the early autumn breeze
A golden sun is shining on my face
Through tangled thoughts
I hear a mockingbird sing
This old world really ain't that
Bad of a place

[Chorus]
Oh why, there's no comprehending
And who am I to try to judge or explain
Oh, but I do have one burning question
Who told you life wasn't worth the fight
They were wrong, they lied
Now you're gone and we cry
Cause it's not like you to walk away
In the middle of a song

[Outro]
Your beautiful song
Your absolutely beautiful song"
Rascal Flatts,Back to Us,"[Verse 1]
I don't say what I mean
I don't mean what I say
It's almost like ain't it me that keeps pushing you away
How many nights have you laid here with me feeling like I left?
Waking up in a stranger's bed

[Verse 2]
Don't know how I got lost
I don't know how to get back
Don't know how you haven't hit the door with your bags all packed
Every morning I hear you pray for the old me
Instead of waking up in a stranger's bed

[Chorus]
I'm gonna run straight back to us baby
No more same old someone else
Back to the one you used to love like crazy
Maybe, you'll save me from myself
When the sun comes around again
You won't be waking up in a stranger's bed

[Verse 3]
I know I say too little
Yeah, I'm gone too much
I don't even remember the last time we touched
Every night it's like you're sleeping with someone you've never met
And waking up in a stranger's bed
I remember the words that you haven't heard for so long
You're not gone yet

[Chorus]
I'm gonna run straight back to us baby
No more same old someone else
Back to the one you used to love like crazy
Maybe, you'll save me from myself
When the sun comes around again
You won't be waking up in a stranger's bed
Oh no, oh woah

[Bridge]
I don't say what I mean
I don't mean what i say
It's almost like it ain't me that keeps pushing you away

[Chorus]
I'm gonna run straight back to us baby
No more same old someone else
Back to the one you used to love like crazy
Maybe, you'll save me from myself

Well, I'm gonna run back to us baby
No more same old someone else
Back to the one you used to love like crazy
Maybe, you'll save me from myself
When the sun comes around again
You won't be waking up in a stranger's bed
Ooh"
Rascal Flatts,Stand,"[Verse 1]
You feel like a candle in a hurricane
Just like a picture with a broken frame
Alone and helpless, like you've lost your fight
But you'll be alright, you'll be alright

[Chorus]
'Cause when push comes to shove
You taste what you're made of
You might bend 'til you break
'Cause it's all you can take
On your knees you look up
Decide you've had enough
You get mad, you get strong
Wipe your hands, shake it off
Then you stand, then you stand

[Verse 2]
Life's like a novel with the end ripped out
The edge of a canyon with only one way down
Take what you're given before it's gone
And start holdin' on, keep holdin' on

[Chorus]
'Cause when push comes to shove
You taste what you're made of
You might bend 'til you break
'Cause it's all you can take
On your knees you look up
Decide you've had enough
You get mad, you get strong
Wipe your hands, shake it off
Then you stand, yeah, then you stand

[Bridge]
Every time you get up
And get back in the race
One more small piece of you
Starts to fall into place, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause when push comes to shove
You taste what you're made of
You might bend 'til you break
'Cause it's all you can take
On your knees you look up
Decide you've had enough
You get mad, you get strong
Wipe your hands, shake it off
Yeah, then you stand
Yeah, baby
Woo hoo, woo hoo
Woo hoo, woo hoo
Then you stand, yeah yeah"
Rascal Flatts,I Like the Sound of That,"[Verse 1]
I love hearing that shower turn on
Bet there's nothing but a towel on on you
You sing along with some Timberlake bumping
But he ain't got nothing on you
I don't wanna hear the coffee pouring
A goodbye kiss, then locking the door, yeah
Sounds like leaving you, oh

[Chorus]
It's a little too loud on the highway
I wanna pull back in your driveway
It's way too quiet at my place
Wanna come on over, come on over
I just wanna hear that ringtone
I like it turned up when you're blowing up my phone
Wanna hear you say come on over
'Cause when you tell me to come on over
I like the sound of that

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
I like the sound, I like the sound of that
Oh-oh-oh
I like the sound, I like the sound of that

[Verse 2]
Love the sound of the thunder rolling
It makes you move a little closer to me
Girl, I bet that your neighbors hate us
'Cause we could laugh all night and never sleep
We can worry 'bout the world in the morning
Light up a candle, lock the door
Wanna stay right here with you, yes I do

[Chorus]
It's a little too loud on the highway
I wanna pull back in your driveway
It's way too quiet at my place
Wanna come on over, come on over
I just wanna hear that ringtone
I like it turned up when you're blowing up my phone
Wanna hear you say come on over
'Cause when you tell me to come on over
I like the sound of that

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
I like the sound, I like the sound of that
Oh-oh-oh
I like the sound, I like the sound of that

[Bridge]
Turn your radio on, baby, turn down the lights
I ain't going nowhere, I'm all yours tonight

[Chorus]
It's a little too loud on the highway
I wanna pull back in your driveway
It's way too quiet at my place
Wanna come on over, come on over
I just wanna hear that ringtone
I like it turned up when you're blowing up my phone
Wanna hear you say come on over
'Cause when you tell me to come on over
I like the sound of that

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
I like the sound and I love the sound of that
Oh-oh-oh
I like the sound, I like the sound of that
Oh-oh-oh
I like the sound, I like the sound of that
Oh-oh-oh (Yes, I do)
I like the sound, I like the sound of that"
Rascal Flatts,Come Wake Me Up,"[Verse 1]
I can usually drink you right off of my mind
But I miss you tonight
I can normally push you right out of my heart
But I'm too tired to fight
Yeah the whole thing begins
And I let you sink into my veins
And I feel the pain like it's new
Everything that we were
Everything that you said
Everything that I did and that I couldn't do
Plays through tonight

[Chorus]
Tonight your memory burns like a fire
With every one, it grows higher and higher
And I can't get over it
I just can't put out this love
I just sit in these flames
And pray that you'll come back
Close my eyes tightly, hold on and
Hope that I'm dreaming
Come wake me up

[Verse 2]
Turn the TV up loud just to drown out your voice
But I can't forget
Now I'm all out of ideas and, baby
I'm down to my last cigarette
Yeah, you're probably asleep deep inside of your dreams
While I'm sitting here crying and trying to see
Yeah, wherever you are, baby now I am sure you moved on
And aren't thinking twice about me and you tonight

[Chorus]
Tonight your memory burns like a fire
With every one, it grows higher and higher
And I can't get over it
I just can't put out this love
I just sit in these flames
And pray that you'll come back
Close my eyes tightly, hold on and
Hope that I'm dreaming

[Bridge]
I know that you're movin' on
I know I should give you up
But I keep hopin' that you'll trip
And fall back in love
Time's not healin' anything
Baby, this pain is worse than it ever was
I know that you can't hear me
But baby I need you to save me tonight

[Chorus]
Tonight your memory burns like a fire
With every one it grows higher and higher
And I can't get over it
I just can't put out this love
I just sit in these flames
And pray that you'll come back
Close my eyes tightly, hold on and
Hope that I'm dreaming
Come wake me up

[Outro]
Oh, I'm dreaming
Come wake me up
Oh, I'm dreaming"
Rascal Flatts,Rewind,"[Verse 1]
Wish I could reach up and reset that sun
Reverse these wheels go back and re-pick you up
Went by so fast oh so sweet
Make me wanna remake a memory
Wish I had me a time machine
Oh

[Chorus]
I float the moon back up in the sky
Put a cork back into that sweet red wine
Put your midnight hair back up so you can let it fall one more time
Untouch your skin
Unkiss your lips and kiss 'em again
So good so right this is one night I'm wishing I could rewind

[Verse 2]
I turn back that radio dial, reopen your door
Try to talk George Strait into giving us an encore
Re-spin you around replay that sound, of you laughing when we hit the ground
I can see it now how bout we

[Chorus]
I float the moon back up in the sky
Put a cork back into that sweet red wine
Put your midnight hair back up so you can let it fall one more time
Untouch your skin
Unkiss your lips and kiss 'em again
So good so right this is one night I'm wishing I could rewind

[Bridge]
I wanna re-fall and re-fly
Baby re-live this night

[Chorus]
I float the moon back up in the sky
Put a cork back into that sweet red wine
Put your midnight hair back up so you can let it fall one more time
Untouch your skin
Unkiss your lips and kiss 'em again
So good so right this is one night I'm wishing I could rewind

[Outro]
I'm wishing I could rewind
I wanna relive this night
So good, so right"
Rascal Flatts,Are You Happy Now,"[Verse 1: Rascal Flatts]
Someone let your secret out
Everybody 'round here's talking about, how your knight in shining armor let you down
And now you're alone, I told you so
This is what you wanted, baby, now you got it
Something's wrong and you can't put your finger on it
Could it be that maybe, you did that to me, baby
And now you found

[Chorus: Rascal Flatts & Lauren Alaina]
What goes around comes back around
It's been that way forever
Baby, just look at you now, barely holding it together
We were so in love, but you gave that up
Just look around, are you happy now?
Oooh, are you happy now?

[Verse 2: Lauren Alaina]
Yeah, you're gonna  spend some sleepless nights
Crying in the glow of the TV light
With some sad song on and a glass of wine
Just to sit in the pain, baby, what a shame
This is what you wanted, baby now you got it
Something's wrong and you can't put your finger on it
Could it be that maybe, you did that to me, baby
And now you found

[Chorus: Rascal Flatts & Lauren Alaina]
What goes around comes back around
It's been that way forever
Baby, just look at you now, barely holding it together
We were so in love, but you gave that up
Just look around
Are you happy now?

[Bridge: Rascal Flatts & Lauren Alaina]
Now that I'm not around (now that I'm not around)
Now that you've finally lost what you thought that you needed
Never would have treated your heart like you did

[Chorus: Rascal Flatts & Lauren Alaina]
What goes around comes back around
It's been that way forever
Baby, just look at you now, barely holding it together
Oh, we were so in love, oh, but you gave that up
Just look around
Just look around

[Chorus: Rascal Flatts & Lauren Alaina]
What goes around comes back around
It's been that way forever
We were so in love (we were so in love)
But you gave that up (but you gave it up)
Just look around
Just look around
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?
Are you happy?

What goes around comes back around"

Na na

Nanananana
Nananananana

[Verse 1]
Sometimes it feels like this world's spinning faster
Than it did in the old days
So naturally, we have more natural disasters
From the strain of a fast pace
Sunday was a day of rest
Now, it's one more day for progress
And we can't slow down (and we can't slow down) 'cause more is less ('cause more is less)
It's all an endless process

[Chorus]
I miss Mayberry
Sittin' on the porch, drinkin' ice-cold cherry coke
Where everything is black and white
(Na-na, na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na)
Pickin' on the six string
People pass by and you call them by their first name
Watchin' the clouds roll by
Bye, bye (Bye, bye)

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I can hear this old earth shoutin'
Through the trees, as the wind blows
That's when I climb up here on this mountain
To look through God's window
Now I can't fly, but I got two feet
To get me high up here
Above the noise and city streets
My worries disappear

[Chorus]
I miss Mayberry
Sittin' on the porch, drinkin' ice-cold cherry coke
Where everything is black and white
(Na-na, na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na)
Pickin' on the six string
People pass by and you call them by their first name
Watchin' the clouds roll by
Bye, bye (Bye)

[Bridge]
Sometimes I dream I'm drivin' down an old dirt road (Down an old dirt road)
Not even listed on a map (Ooh, yeah)
I pass a dad and son carrying a fishing pole
But I always wake up every time I try to turn back

[Chorus]
I miss Mayberry
Sittin' on the porch, drinkin' ice-cold cherry coke
Where everything is black and white
(Na-na, na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na)
Pickin' on the six string
Where people pass by and you call them by their first name
Watchin' the clouds roll by
Bye, bye (Bye)
Bye, bye (Bye)

Rascal Flatts,Skin (Sarabeth),"[Verse 1]
Sarabeth is scared to death
To hear what the doctor will say
She hasn't been well
Since the day that she fell
And the bruise, it just won't go away
So she sits and she waits, with her mother and dad
And flips through an old magazine
'Til the nurse with a smile
Stands at the door
And says, 'Will you please come with me?'

[Verse 2]
Sarabeth is scared to death
'Cause the doctor just told her the news
Between the red cells and white
Something's not right
But we're gonna take care of you
Six chances in ten, it won't come back again
With the therapy, we're gonna try
It's just been approved
It's the strongest there is
And I think we caught it in time

[Chorus]
Sarabeth closes her eyes
And she dreams she's dancin'
Around and around, without any cares
And her very first love is holding her close
And the soft wind is blowing her hair

[Verse 3]
Sarabeth is scared to death
As she sits, holding her mom
Says it would be a mistake
For someone to take
A girl with no hair to the prom
For just this mornin', right there on her pillow
Was the cruelest of any surprise
And she cried when she gathered it all in her hands
The proof that she couldn't deny

[Chorus]
Sarabeth closes her eyes
And she dreams she's dancing
Around and around, without any cares
And her very first love was holding her close
And the soft wind is blowing her hair

[Bridge]
It's quarter to seven, that boy's at the door
And her daddy ushers him in
When he takes off his cap, they all start to cry
'Cause this morning where his hair had been
Softly, she touches just skin

[Outro]
They go dancin'
Around and around, without any cares
And her very first, true love is holding her close
And for a moment, she isn't scared"
Rascal Flatts,I’ll Be Home For Christmas,"I'll be home for Christmas

If only in my dreams

I'll be home, I'll be home
If only in my dreams
I'll be home, I'll be home

Ooh, hiya
I miss you so much
Your light, your smile, your way
And everything about us
Now you're gone
You're still here in my heart, in my tears
Yeah, you sure left your mark
And we were just getting started

[Chorus]
It wasn't long enough
It wasn't long enough together
But it was long enough
Yeah, it was long enough to last forever

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I get so mad, I scream, I swear at this
'Cause this isn't how we planned it
I sit here in a cold room
Prayin', waitin' on you
To run back through that door
To the way is was before
You left

It wasn't long enough
It wasn't long enough together
But it was long enough
Yeah, it was long enough to last forever

I've been cheated (I've been Cheated)

It wasn't long enough
It wasn't long enough

Rascal Flatts,Riot,"[Verse 1]
I'd be ridin' in a cab goin' downtown
Findin' faces I know in a big crowd
Tryin' to drink the pain away, mhmm
And I'd be stayin' out all night, never goin' home
Girl you know I'd lose all control
If I lost you

[Chorus]
There would be a riot
Breakin' of my heart, I'd try to fight it
I could go out every night but I'd be lyin'
If I said I could live and breathe
Without you
There'd be a lot of lonely
Wishin' and prayin' that you would hold me
I would do most anything baby
If only you would come back to me
Come back to me
There would be a riot
Oh yeah, oooh

I'd be checkin' on my phone every minute
Waitin' 'round for it to start ringin'
And prayin' it would be you
I don't know what I'd do

There would be a riot
Breakin' of my heart, I'd try to fight it
I could go out every night but I'd be lyin'

Tennessee Ernie Ford,Sixteen Tons,"[Verse 1]
Some people say a man is made out of mud
A poor man's made out of muscle and blood
Muscle and blood and skin and bones
A mind that's weak and a back that's strong

[Chorus]
You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

[Verse 2]
I was born one morning when the sun didn't shine
I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine
I loaded sixteen tons of number 9 coal
And the straw boss said, ""Well-a bless my soul!""

[Chorus]
You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

[Verse 3]
I was born one morning, it was drizzlin' rain
Fightin' and trouble are my middle name
I was raised in the canebrake by an old mama lion
Can't no high-toned woman make me walk the line

[Chorus]
You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

[Verse 4]
If you see me comin' better step aside
A lot of men didn't, a lot of men died
One fist of iron, the other of steel
If the right one don't getcha then the left one will

[Chorus]
You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store"

Tennessee Ernie Ford,Shenandoah,"Oh, Shenandoah
I hear you calling
Hi-O, you rolling river
Oh, Shenandoah
I long to hear you
Hi-O, I'm bound away
’Cross the wide Missouri
Missouri, she's a mighty river
Hi-O, you rolling river
When she rolls down
Her tops'll shiver
Hi-O, I’m bound away
'Cross the wide Missouri
Farewell my dearest
I'm bound to leave you
Hi-O, you rolling river
Oh, Shenandoah
I'll not deceive you
Hi-O, I'm bound away
'Cross the wide Missouri"
Tennessee Ernie Ford,The Fall of Charleston,"Oh have you heard the glorious news, is the cry from every mouth
Charleston is taken, and the rebels put to rout;
And Beauregard the chivalrous, he ran to save his bacon—
When he saw General Sherman’s Yanks, and “Charleston is taken!”

With a whack, rowdy-dow
A hunky boy is General Sherman
Whack, rowdy-dow
Invincible is he!

This South Carolina chivalry, they once did loudly boast
That the footsteps of a Union man, should ne’er pollute their coast
They’d fight the Yankees two to one, who only fought for booty
But when the mudsills came along it was “Legs, do your duty!”

With a whack, rowdy-dow
Babylon is fallen
Whack, rowdy-dow
The end is drawing near!

And from the “Sacred City,” this valiant warlike throng;
Skedaddled in confusion, although thirty thousand strong—
Without a shot, without a blow, or least sign of resistance
And leaving their poor friends behind, with the Yankees for assistance!

With a whack, rowdy-dow
How are you, Southern chivalry?
Whack, rowdy-dow
Your race is nearly run!

And again o’er Sumter’s battered walls, the Stars and Stripes do fly
While the chivalry of Sixty-one in the last ditch does lie;—
With Sherman, Grant and Porter too, to lead our men to glory
We’ll squash poor Jeff’s confederacy, and then get hunkydory!

With a whack, rowdy-dow
How are you, neutral Johnny Bull?
Whack, rowdy-dow
We’ll settle next with you!"
Tennessee Ernie Ford,The Watermelon Song,"Down in Tennessee I used to sit upon the fence
A-wonderin' about the lack of people's common sense

What I didn't understand then couldn't keep concealed
Was one great big fat watermelon layin' in the field

See that watermelon hangin' on the vine
I wish that watermelon could be mine

The farmer must be careless
Without a lick of sense
Or he wouldn't leave it hangin'
On the vine

Cornbread is sweet
Pork chops are good
Blackeyed peas are mighty, mighty fine
But give me, oh give me
I really wish you would
That watermelon hangin' on the vine

Got a gal who loves me
She always treats me fine
She lets hug and kiss her all the time
I wish that all her kisses
Could taste half as sweet
As the watermelon hangin' on the vine

Oh kissin' is sweet
Huggin' is good
Cherry lips taste mighty, mighty fine
But give me, oh give me
I really wish you would
That watermelon hangin' on the vine

Well I see that watermelon
So thick, so fat, so fine
What a shame to go leavin' it behind

I know my baby's waitin'
She won't be waitin' long
Now that I got that watermelon off the vine

Oh cornbread is sweet
Pork chops are good
Blackeyed peas are mighty, mighty fine
But I ought to tell you
I really think I should
For lickin' good eatin'
Eat a watermelon hangin' on the vine"
Tennessee Ernie Ford,The Shot Gun Boogie,"There it stands in the corner with the barrel so straight
I looked out the winder and over the gate
The big fat rabbits are jumpin' in the grass
Wait 'till they hear my old shotgun blast

Shotgun boogie, I done saw your track
Look out Mr. Rabbit when I cock my hammer back

Well, over on the ridge is a scaly bark
Hickory nuts so big you can see'em in the dark
The big fat squirrels, they scratch and they fight
I'll be on that ridge before daylight

With a shotgun boogie, all I need is one shot
Look out bushy-tails, tonight you'll be in the pot

Well, I met a pretty gal, she was tall and thin
I asked her what she had, she said a Fox four-ten
I looked her up and down, said boy this is love
So we headed for the brush to shoot a big fat dove

Shotgun boogie, boy the feathers flew
Look out Mr. Dove when she draws a bead on you

I sat down on a log, took her on my lap
She said wait a minute bud, you got to see my pap
He's gotta sixteen gauge choked down like a rifle
He don't like a man that's gonna trifle

Shotgun boogie, draws a bead so fine
Look out big boy, he's loaded all the time

Well, I called on her pap like a gentleman oughter
He said no brush hunter's gonna get my daughter
He cocked back the hammer right on the spot
When the gun went off I outrun the shot

Shotgun boogie, I wanted weddin' bells
I'll be back little gal, when your pappy runs out of shells"
Tennessee Ernie Ford,The Girl I Left Behind Me,"The hour was sad, I left the maid
A lingering farewell taking
Her sighs and tears, her steps delayed
I thought her heart was breaking
In hurried words, her name I blessed
I breathed the vows that bind me
And to my heart in anguish pressed
The girl I left behind me

Then to the south we bore away
To win a name in story
And there where dawns the sun of day
There dawned our sun of glory
Both blazed in noon on freedom's height
Where in the post assigned me
I shared the glory of that fight
Sweet girl I left behind me

Full many a name our banners bore
Of former deeds of daring
But they were days of seventy six
In which we had no sharing
But now our laurels freshly won
With the old ones shall entwine thee
Still worthy of our sires, each son
Sweet girl I left behind me

The hope of final victory
Within my bosom burning
Is mingling with sweet thoughts of thee
And of my fond returning
But should I ne'er return again
Still worth thy love thou't find me
Dishonors breath shall never stain
The name I left behind me"
Tennessee Ernie Ford,Hambone,"Hambone! Hambone!

Hambone, hambone
Where you been?
Round the world and I'm going again
What you gonna do when you come back?
Take a little walk by the railroad track
Hambone

Hambone, hambone
Have you heard?
Papa's gonna buy me a mocking bird
And if that mocking bird don't sing
Papa's gonna buy me a diamond ring
And if that diamond ring don't shine
Papa's gonna take it to the five and dime
Hambone

Hambone, hambone
Where you been?
Round the world and I'm going again
I just skinned an alley cat
To make my wife a Sunday hat
Took the hide right off a goat
To make my wife a Sunday coat

Hambone, hambone
Where's your wife
Out to the kitchen, cooking beans and rice
Hambone
Hambone

Hambone, hambone
Trying to eat
Ketchup on his elbow, pickle on his feet
Bread in the basket
Chicken in the stew
Supper on the fire for me and you

Look at him holler, look at him moan
That hambone just can't hambone
Hambone
Hambone"
Tennessee Ernie Ford,The Bonnie Blue Flag,"We are a band of brothers
And native to the soil
Fighting for the property
We gained by honest toil;
And when our rights were threatened
The cry rose near and far-
""Hurrah for the Bonnie Blue Flag
That bears a single star!""

[Chorus:]
Hurrah! Hurrah!
For Southern rights hurrah!
Hurrah for the Bonnie Blue Flag
That bears a single star
As long as the Union
Was faithful to her trust
Like friends and like brothers
Both kind were we and just;
But now, when Northern treachery
Attempts our rights to mar
We hoist on high the Bonnie Blue Flag
That bears a single star

[Chorus]
First gallant South Carolina
Nobly made the stand
Then came Alabama
Who took her by the hand
Next quickly Mississippi
Georgia and Florida
All raised on high the Bonnie Blue Flag
That bears a single star

[Chorus]
Ye men of valor, gather round
The banner of the right;
Texas and fair Louisiana
Join us in the fight
Davis, our loved president
And Stephens statesmen are;
Now rally round the Bonnie Blue Flag
That bears a single star

[Chorus]
And here's to old Virginia-
The Old Dominion State-
Who with the young Confederacy
At length has linked her fate;
Impelled by her example
Now other states prepare
To hoist on high the Bonnie Blue Flag
That bears a single star

[Chorus]
Then cheer, boys, cheer;
Raise the joyous shout
For Arkansas and North Carolina
Now have both gone out;
And let another rousing cheer
For Tennessee be given
The single star of the Bonnie Blue Flag
Has grown to be eleven

[Chorus]
Then here's to our Confederacy
Strong are we and brave;
Like patriots of old we'll fight
Our heritage to save
And rather than submit to shame
To die we would prefer;
So cheer for the Bonnie Blue Flag
That bears a single star

[Chorus]"
Tennessee Ernie Ford,Dark as a Dungeon,"Come listen you fellers, so young and so fine
And seek not your fortune in the dark dreary mines
It'll form as a habit and seep in your soul
Till the stream of your blood is as black as the coal

It's dark as a dungeon and damp as the dew
Where the danger is double and pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls and the sun never shines
It's dark as a dungeon way down in the mines

It's many a man I have known in my day
Who live just to labor his young life away
Where the dеmons of death often come by surprisе
One fall of a slate and you're buried alive

I hope when I'm gone and the ages shall roll
My body will blacken and turn into coal
Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home
And pity the miner digging my bones

It's dark as a dungeon and damp as the dew
Where danger is double and pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls and the sun never shines
It's dark as a dungeon way down in the mines"
Tennessee Ernie Ford,River of No Return,"There is a river called the river of no return
Sometimes it's peaceful and sometimes wild and free!
Love is a traveler on the river of no return
Swept on forever to be lost in the stormy sea

(Wail-a-ree) I can hear the river call (no return, no return)
Where the roarin' waters fall wail-a-ree
I can hear my lover call ""Come to me"" (no return, no return)
I lost my love on the river and forever my heart will yearn
Gone, gone forever down the river of no return
Wail-a-ree (Wail-a-ree), wail-a-ree
She'll never return to me! (no return, no return, no return)"
Tennessee Ernie Ford,Marching Through Georgia,"Bring the good old bugle boys, we'll sing another song!
Sing it with the spirit that will start the world along!
Sing it as we used to sing it, 50, 000 strong!
While we were marching through Georgia!

Hurrah! Hurrah! We bring the jubilee!
Hurrah! Hurrah! The flag that makes you free!
So we sang the chorus from Atlanta to the sea!
While we were marching through Georgia!

There were many Union men who wept with joyful tears!
When they saw the honored flag they had not seen for years!
Hardly could they be restrained from breaking forth in cheers!
While we were marching through Georgia!

Hurrah! Hurrah! We bring the jubilee!
Hurrah! Hurrah! The flag that makes you free!
So we sang the chorus from Atlanta to the sea!
While we were marching through Georgia!

So we made a thoroughfare for Freedom and her train!
Sixty miles in latitude, three hundred to the Maine!
Treason fled before us for resistance was in vain!
While we were marching through Georgia!
Hurrah! Hurrah! We bring the jubilee!

Hurrah! Hurrah! The flag that makes you free!
So we sang the chorus from Atlanta to the sea!

While we were marching
While we were marching
While we were marching through Georgia!"
Tennessee Ernie Ford,Goober Peas,"Sitting by the Roadside on a summer's day
Chatting with my messmates passing time away
Lying in the shadow underneath the trees
Goodness how delicious, eating goober peas!

Peas! Peas! Peas! Peas!
Eating goober peas!
Peas! Peas! Peas! Peas!
Eating goober peas!
Goodness how delicious, eating goober peas!

To cry out at their loudest ""Mister here's your mule""

He turns around in wonder, and what do you think he sees
The Georgia Militia, eating goober peas!

Peas! Peas! Peas! Peas!
Eating goober peas!
Peas! Peas! Peas! Peas!
Eating goober peas!
Goodness how delicious, eating goober peas!
Peas! Peas! Peas! Peas!
Delicious goober peas

I think my song has lasted almost long enough
The subject's interesting, but rhymes are mighty rough
I wish this war was over when free from rags, and fleas
We'd kiss our wives and sweethearts, and gobble goober peas!

Peas! Peas! Peas! Peas!
Eating goober peas!

Eating goober peas!

Tennessee Ernie Ford,My Task,"To love someone more dearly every day
To help a wandering child to find his way
To ponder o'er a noble thought and pray (Ponder and pray)
And smile when evening falls
And smile when evening falls
This is my task

To follow truth as blind men long for light
To do my best from dawn of day till night
To keep my heart fit for His holy sight
And answer when He calls
And answer when He calls
This is my task

And then my Savior by and by to meet
When faith hath made her task on Earth complete
And lay my homage at the Master's feet
Within the jasper walls
Within the jasper walls
This is my task
This is my task"

Tennessee Ernie Ford,The Army of the Free,"In the army of the Union we are marching in the van
And will do the work before us, if the bravest soldiers
Can
We will drive the Rebel forces from their strongholds
To the sea
And will live and die together in the Army of the Free

We may rust beneath inaction, we may sink beneath
Disease
The summer sun may scorch us or the winter's blasts may
Freeze
But whatever may befall us, we will let the Rebels see
That unconquered we shall still remain the Army of the
Free

The Army of the Free, in the Army of the Free
That unconquered we shall still remain the Army of the
Free

We have Butterfield the daring and we've Martindale the

School
Add Morell to the list of names and we must all agree
We have the finest Generals in the Army of the Free

The Army of the Free, in the Army of the Free
We have the finest Generals in the Army of the Free

Tennessee Ernie Ford,Virginia’s Bloody Soil,"Come all you loyal unionists, wherever you may be
I hope you'll pay attention and listen unto me
For well you know the blood and woe, the misery, the toil
It took to down secession on Virginia's bloody soil

When our good flag, the Stars and Stripes, from Sumter's walls was hurled
And high overhead on the forwardest walls the Rebel's flag unfurled
It aroused each loyal Northern man and caused his blood to boil
For to see that flag, Secession's rag, float o'er Virginia's soil

Then from the hills and mountain tops there came that wild alarm
Rise up ye gallant sons of North
Our country calls to arms
Come from the plains o'er hill and dale, ye hardy sons of toil
For our flag is trampled in the dust on Virginia's bloody soil

And thousands left their native homes, some never to return
And many's the wife and family dear were left behind to mourn
There was one who went among them who from danger would ne'er recoil
His bones lie bleaching on the fields of Virginia's bloody soil

When on the field of battle, he never was afraid
When cannons loud would rattle, he stood there
Undismayed
When bullets rained around him, he stood there with a
Smile
Saying, ""We'll conquer, boys, or leave our bones on
Virginia's bloody soil""

In the great fight of the Wilderness, where many's the
Brave man fell
He boldly led his comrades on through Rebel shot and
Shell
The wounded 'round they strewed the ground; the dead
Lay heaped in piled
The comrades weltered in their blood on Virginia's
Bloody soil

The Rebels fought like fury, or tigers drove to bay
They knew full well, if the truth they'd tell, they could not win the day
It was hand to hand they fought 'em. The struggle was fierce and wild
Till a bullet pierced our captain's brain, on Virginia's bloody soil

But above that din of battle, what was that dreadful
Cry?
The woods are all afire, where our dead and wounded lie
The sight to behold next morning would make the stoutest heart recoil
To see the charred remains of thousands on Virginia's bloody soil

And now our hero's sleeping with thousands of the brave
No marble slab does mark the place that shows where he was laid
He died to save our Union
He's free of care and toil
Thank God
The Stars and Stripes still wave above Virginia's soil"
Tennessee Ernie Ford,Bringing In The Sheaves,"Sowing in the morning, sowing seeds of kindness
Sowing in the noontide and the dewy eve;
Waiting for the harvest, and the time of reaping
We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves

Refrain

Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the sheaves
We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves
Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the sheaves
We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves

Sowing in the sunshine, sowing in the shadows
Fearing neither clouds nor winter's chilling breeze;
By and by the harvest, and the labor ended
We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves

Refrain

Going forth with weeping, sowing for the Master
Though the loss sustained our spirit often grieves;
When our weeping's over, He will bid us welcome
We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves

Tennessee Ernie Ford,The Ballad of Davy Crockett,"[Verse 1]
Born on a mountain in Tennessee
Greenest state in the land of the free
Raised in the woods so's he knew every tree
He killed him a b'ar when he was only three

[Chorus]
Davy, Davy Crockett, king of the wild frontier

[Verse 2]
Fought single-handed thru the Injun war
'Till the Creeks was whipped and the peace was in store
And while he was a'handlin' this risky chore
Made hisself a legend forever more

[Chorus]
Davy, Davy Crockett, the man who don't know fear

[Verse 3]
When he lost his love, his grief was gall
In his heart, he wanted to leave it all
And lose hisself in the forest tall
But he answered, instead, his country's call

[Chorus]
Davy, Davy Crockett, the choice of the whole frontier

[Verse 4]
He went off to Congress and served a spell
Fixin' up the government and laws as well
Took over Washington, so I hear tell
And patched up a crack in the Liberty Bell

[Chorus]
Davy, Davy Crockett, seein' his duty clear

[Verse 5]
When he came home, his politickin' done
Why, the big western march had just begun
So he packed his gear and his trusty gun
And lit out a'grinnin' to follow the sun

[Chorus]
Davy, Davy Crockett, leadin' the pioneer

[Verse 6]
His land is the biggest, his land is the best
From grassy plaines to the mountain crest
He's ahead of us all and meetin' the test
And a'follern' his legend right into the west

[Chorus]
Davy, Davy Crockett, king of the wild frontier
Davy, Davy Crockett, king of the wild frontier"
Tennessee Ernie Ford,Marching Song of the First Arkansas Negro Regiment,"Oh, we’re the bully soldiers of the “First of Arkansas”
We are fighting for the Union, we are fighting for the law
We can hit a Rebel further than a white man ever saw
As we go marching on

Glory, glory hallelujah
Glory, glory hallelujah
Glory, glory hallelujah
As we go marching on

We heard the Proclamation, master hush it as he will
The bird he sing it to us, hopping on the cotton hill
And the possum up the gum tree, he couldn’t keep it still
As he went climbing on

Glory, glory hallelujah
Glory, glory hallelujah
Glory, glory hallelujah
As we go marching on

We have done with hoeing cotton, we have done with hoeing corn
We are colored Yankee soldiers, now, as sure as you are born
When the masters hear us yelling, they’ll think it’s Gabriel’s horn
As we go marching on

Glory, glory hallelujah
Glory, glory hallelujah
Glory, glory hallelujah
As we go marching on

Then fall in, colored brethren, you’d better do it soon
Don’t you hear the drum a-drumming the Yankee Doodle tune?
We are with you now this morning, we’ll be far away at noon
As we go marching on

Glory, glory hallelujah
Glory, glory hallelujah
Glory, glory hallelujah
As we go marching on
As we go marching on"
Tennessee Ernie Ford,The Cry of the Wild Goose,"[Verse 1]
Tonight I heard the wild goose cry
Wingin' north in the lonely sky
Tried to sleep, but it ain't no use
'Cause I am the brother to the old wild goose

[Chorus]
My heart knows what the wild goose knows
And I must go where the wild goose goes
Wild goose, brother goose, which is best
A wanderin' foot or a heart at rest

[Verse 2]
The cabin is warm and the snow is deep
And I've got a woman, she lies asleep
When she wakes at tomorrow's dawn
She'll find, poor critter, that her man is gone

[Chorus]
My heart knows what the wild goose knows
And I must go where the wild goose goes
Wild goose, brother goose, which is best
A wanderin' foot or a heart at rest

[Verse 3]
My woman was kind and true to me
Thinks she loves me, the mournful she
She's gotta learn that it ain't no use
To love the brother to the old wild goose

[Chorus]
My heart knows what the wild goose knows
And I must go where the wild goose goes
Wild goose, brother goose, which is best
A wanderin' foot or a heart at rest

[Verse 4]
Spring is comin' and the ice will break
And I can't linger for a woman's sake
She'll see a shadow pass overhead
She'll find a feather beside my bed

[Chorus]
My heart knows what the wild goose knows
And I must go where the wild goose goes
Wild goose, brother goose, which is best
A wanderin' foot or a heart at rest
Wild goose"
Tennessee Ernie Ford,Stonewall Jackson’s Way,"Come, stack arms, men. Pile on the rails
Stir up the campfire bright;
No matter if the canteen fails
We'll make a roaring night
Here Shenandoah brawls along
There burly Blue Ridge echoes strong
To swell the brigade's rousing song
Of ""Stonewall Jackson's way.""

We see him now, the old slouched hat
Cocked o'er his eye askew
The shrewd, dry smile, the speech so pat
So calm, so blunt, so true
That ""Blue-Light Elder"" knows 'em well
Says he, ""That's Banks; he's fond of shell
Lord save his soul! We'll give him""...well
That's ""Stonewall Jackson's way.""

Silence! Ground arms! Kneel all! Caps off!
Old Blue Light's going to pray;
Strangle the fool that dares to scoff;
Attention; it's his way!
Appealing from his native sod
In forma pauperis to God--
""Lay bare thine arm; stretch forth thy rod;
Amen."" That's ""Stonewall's way.""

He's in the saddle now! Fall in!
Steady, the whole brigade!
Hill's at the ford, cut off! He'll win
His way out, ball and blade
What matter if our shoes are worn?
What matter if our feet are torn?
""Quick step--we're with him ere the dawn!""
That's ""Stonewall Jackson's way.""

The sun's bright glances rout the mists
Of morning, and, by George!
There's Longstreet struggling in the lists
Hemmed in an ugly gorge--
Pope and his Yankees whipped before
""Bayonet and grape!"" hear Stonewall roar
""Charge, Stuart! Pay off Ashby's score
In Stonewall Jackson's way.""

Ah, maiden! wait and watch and yearn
For news of Stonewall's band!
Ah, widow! read with eyes that burn
That ring upon thy hand!
Ah, wife! sew on, pray on, hope on
Thy life shall not be all forlorn
The foe had better ne'er been born
That gets in Stonewall's way"
Tennessee Ernie Ford,The New York Volunteer,"'Twas in the days of seventy-six
When freemen young and old
All fought for Independence then
Each hero brave and bold!
'Twas then the noble Stars and Stripes
In triumph did appear
And defended by brave patriots
The Yankee Volunteers
'Tis my delight to march and fight
Like a New York Volunteer!

Now, there's our City Regiments
Just see what they have done:
The first to offer to the State
To go to Washington
To protect the Federal Capital
And the flag they love so dear!
And they've done their duty nobly
Like New York Volunteers!
'Tis my delight to march and fight
Like a New York Volunteer!
The Rebels out in Maryland
They madly raved and swore
They'd let none of our Union troops
Pass through Baltimore
But the Massachusetts Regiment
No traitors did they fear
But fought their way to Washington
Like Yankee Volunteers!
'Tis my delight to march and fight
Like a New York Volunteer!"
Mel Tillis,Send Me Down to Tucson,"No one wants to go down to Tucson in the summer
So this time the boss chose me
I’ve been sort of restless yes he thought it might help if
I got away from my wife and family

There’s been no other woman since the mother of my children
And in each and every way she’s a lady
Now there’s one that I’ll remember a sultry night we spent together
And she satisfied the love inside of me

Go on and send me down to Tucson and I’ll get the job done
And call up the one whose love is free
She may be easy and I love my lady
But the lady don’t satisfy the love inside of me

I know the lady’s not to blame cause they raised her prime and proper
While another takes her pleasures where she can
The one in Tucson she don’t hide it and when she gets excited
She makes you feel your every inch a man

But if I could have a wish that I knew would be granted
Don’t you know that one wish would be
Just to lay beside my lady and she’d be the kind of lady
To satisfy the love inside of me

Go on and send me down to Tucson and I’ll get the job done
And call up the one whose love is free
She may be easy and I love my lady
But the lady don’t satisfy the love inside of me

Go on and send me down to Tucson and I’ll get the job done
Go on and send me down to Tucson and I’ll get the job done"
Mel Tillis,Coca Cola Cowboy,"[Verse 1]
I called collect on the phone
You say you're tired and alone
But it sounds like someone else is lying there
She said, ""Don't call me no more
I've changed the locks on my door
It's too late now, I know you'll never change
And she said...

[Chorus]
You're just a Coca Cola cowboy
You got an Eastwood smile and a Robert Redford hair
But you walked across my heart like it was Texas
You taught me how to say I just don't care

[Verse 2]
She said, just leave me alone
And let me hang up this phone
'Cause he'll see me cry, and think I still love you
She said don't call me no more
I've changed the locks on my door
It's too late now and I hope you understand
And she said...

[Chorus]
You're just a Coca Cola cowboy
You got an Eastwood smile and a Willie Nelson hair
But you walked across my heart like it was Texas
Taught me how to say I just don't care (Haha)

[Bridge]
And she said...

[Chorus]
You're just a Coca Cola cowboy
You got an Eastwood smile and a Porter Wagoner hair
But you walked across my heart like it was Texas
You taught me how to say I just don't care
Yeah, you walked across my heart like it was Texas
You taught me how to say I just don't care

[Outro]
Yeah, thank you so much"
Mel Tillis,Ain’t No California,"Well I live my life on highways, from sea to shining sea
So listen to my story, save yourself some agony
Forget that urge to wander, like a shadow on the ground
Find yourself a woman, get a job and settle down

Cause there ain’t no California, where the water tastes like wine
Ain’t no Big Rock Candy Mountain, where you feel good all the time
I ain’t found that old blue bayou, thou I roamed my whole life long
Searching for my blue heaven, heard somewhere it’s called home

So don’t you listen to those freight trains, let them scream into the night
Don’t watch those greyhound buses, semi-trucks and airplane lines
Let someone else be lonely, let someone else be cold
Let someone else make sure those lies and stories all get told

Cause there ain’t no California, where the water tastes like wine
Ain’t no Big Rock Candy Mountain, where you feel good all the time
I ain’t found that old blue bayou, thou I roamed my whole life long
Searching for my blue heaven, heard somewhere it’s called home

Cause there ain’t no California, where the water tastes like wine
Ain’t no Big Rock Candy Mountain, where you feel good all the time
I ain’t found that old blue bayou, thou I roamed my whole life long
Searching for my blue heaven, heard somewhere it’s called home"
Mel Tillis,Memory Maker,"Walkin' all over this lonely city
Nothing in my heart but I could stand pity
'Cause I'm still in love with a girl that didn't do me right

But there ain't no way for me to forget her
I ain't never been cheated any better
And I'll bet she's cheatin' someone else tonight

She's a heart breaker, she's a love taker, she's a memory maker
And I'll bet she's a makin' memories tonight

(Interlude)

Well her memory's like a bug and it keeps on a crawlin'
Over my mind and the tears keep a fallin'
Thinkin' about the thing that might have been

Well this old heart of mine can't take it
I still love her and I can't shake it
I'll bet she's shakin' someone else tonight

She's a heart breaker, she's a love taker, she's a memory maker
And I'll bet she's makin' memories tonight

She's a heart breaker, she's a love taker, she's a memory maker........fades
And I'll bet she's a makin' memories tonight"
Mel Tillis,Who’s Julie,"Cross the table over coffee just this morning
My woman caught me by surprice without a warning
She said honey you talked in your sleep and then she began to weep
And she said tell me now and tell me truly who's Julie

With a blank look on my face I searched my mind
For an answer or excuse of some kind
But the words wouldn't come and my mind was blank slowly my head just sank
When she said honey you know I love you truly but who's Julie
Oh Julie what's this hold you've got on me
On my mind in my dreams you know you shouldn't be there Julie

I'd like to say Julie's just a friend of mine
But I know that would not satisfy your mind
You see Julie gave me something you did not she remembered what you forgot
And honey I'm sorry I have to tell you so cruely
But now you know and don't you ever ask me again who's Julie mhm"
Mel Tillis,New Patches,"Now and then an old friend tries to help me
By telling me there's someone that I should meet
Hey, but I don't have the heart to start all over
'Cause my heart is laying at another's feet

You just don't put new patches on old garments
Hey, I don't want no one else on my mind
I just don't need nobody new to cling to, Lord
'Cause I still love someone I've known a long, long time

I have built my world around a memory
And she's the only one that I let in
'Cause every time I've tried to love somebody, Lord
In my mind I'm loving her again

You just don't put new patches on old garments
Hey, and I don't want no one else on my mind
I just don't need nobody new to cling to, Lord
'Cause I still love someone I've known a long, long time
Yes, I still love someone I've known a long, long time"
Mel Tillis,I Got The Hoss,"Hey baby, let me see your brand new saddle
Let's that pretty thing up on my horse
Let's get it on real tight now
'Cause we don't want you falling off

Well, I got the horse and you got the saddle
We like to ride side by side
Aw, I got the horse and she got the saddle
Together we're gonna ride, ride, ride

In the moonlight by the river
By the honeysuckle vine
We'll be riding, peeping and hiding
Till we see the morning light

Well, I got the horse and you got the saddle
We like to ride side by side
Aw, I got the horse and she got the saddle
Together we're gonna ride, ride, ride

Hey, baby, let's stop for a little while
I need to give my old horse a rest
And you know there ain't no use
In us trying to wear out your new saddle

Hear the crickets singing softly
Never heard a sweeter sound
And you know crickets do their singing
By just rubbing their legs around

Well, I got the horse and you got the saddle
We like to ride side by side
Aw, I got the horse and she got the saddle
Together we're gonna ride, ride, ride

Well, I got the horse and you got the saddle
We like to ride side by side
Aw, I got the horse and she got the saddle
Together we're gonna ride, ride, ride"
Mel Tillis,Sawmill,"Well, once I was a slave at the sawmill
Talk about a poor boy, talk about a poor boy
Never saw a dollar bill

Well, my work was so hard at the sawmill
Think about a poor boy, think about a poor boy
When you go to write your will

Well, seen my teardrops falling down
My wife left this sawmill town
She said, sawmill life had many sins
'Cause the gravy was too thin

I can't work no more at the sawmill
Mercy on a poor boy, mercy on a poor boy
Let me have a dollar bill

If you bring your wife to the sawmill
Well, how you gonna please her, how you gonna please her
When she wants a dollar bill

They're not satisfied at the sawmill
Women like a dollar, women like a dollar
Yes, and women always will

Seen my teardrops falling down
My wife left this sawmill town
She said the sawmill life had many sins, Lord
'Cause the gravy was too thin

I can't work no more at the sawmill
Mercy on a poor boy, mercy on a poor boy
Let me have a dollar bill
Mercy on a poor boy, mercy on a poor boy
Let me have a dollar bill"
Mel Tillis,That’s Where My Money Goes,"Oh boy that's where my money goes
I've got a gal in Monroeville she won't dance but her sister will
Oh boy that's where my money goes
And I've got a gal out in Florida she won't swing but the show will sway
Oh boy that's where my money goes
Work my fingers to the bone so I can take more dollars home
Workin' over time at the mill turn the pay for my baby's bills
My gal wears fancy clothes red tall shoes and rolldown hose
Oh boy that's where my money goes

My gal drives a limousine and you know who buys the gasoline
Oh boy that's where my money goes
My gal lives like a movie star pink champaigne and caviar
Oh boy that's where my money goes
Work my fingers to the bone...
Oh boy that's where my money goes"
Mel Tillis,Best Way I Know How,"I look up and there you stand before me
Looking so surprised at what you see
Did you really think I'd be the same without you
And stay the way that you remember me

I had reasons for resisting all temptation
And the reason's standing right before me now
And I hope you'll take into consideration
That I'm getting by the best way I know how

All the empty bottles on the tables
And I seldom even shave or comb my hair
No I didn't drink so much that I'm not able
It's just that I'm not going anywhere

Seeing me like this I hope you won't feel guilty
And don't blame yourself for what I'm doing now
I'm just right back where I was before you met me
And I'm getting by the best way I know how

And I'm getting by the best way I know how..."
Mel Tillis,Southern Rains,"[Verse 1]
Sometimes my soul gets weary and my mind begins to wander
And like that old train ""The Hummingbird"" it goes to Alabam
They say home is where the heart is and mine is down in Dixie
And when you go down to Dixie, you're heading for higher ground

[Chorus]
(Southern rain)
Blowing from the coast of Mississippi
(Southern rain)
I fell better when those southern waters hit me
I can't get into Jordan seven times to ease the pain
But I can pray for help and hope for southern rain
(Southern rain)
Like the sunshine it's a blessing sent from heaven
(Southern rain)
They can wash away your cares if you let them
You may not believe my story and you may think I'm insane
But they're the closest thing to home those southern rains

[Verse 2]
Homesick is a feeling that a body can't get over
There's no such thing as healing and it won't go away with time
When were young we want to get away when we're old we want to go back
And we spend our lives replacing all the things we leave behind

[Chorus]
(Southern rain)
Blowing from the coast of Mississippi
(Southern rain)
I fell better when those southern waters hit me
I can't get into Jordan seven times to easy the pain
But I can pray for help and hope for southern rain
(Southern rain)
Like the sunshine it's a blessing sent from heaven
(Southern rain)
They can wash away your cares if you let them
You may not believe my story and you may think I'm insane
But they're the closest thing to home those southern rains"
Mel Tillis,Heart Over Mind,"I love you so much that I can't leave you even though my mind tells me I should
But then you make me think you really want me
Then all my thoughts of leaving do no good
You've got me heart over mind worried all the time
Knowing you will always be the same
You keep hurting me I know but I just can't let you go
Cause my heart won't let my love for you change

Now friends tell me they see you out with others and in my heart I try hard to forget
But you come home and tell me you still love me
And I still hope there's some chance for us yet
You've got me heart over mind...
Cause my heart won't let my love for you change"
Mel Tillis,"Midnight, Me and the Blues","Long train rumbles low in the distance hear it blow
Don't engineers know I miss you?
And they're reminding me how lonely nights can be
When it's midnight, me and the blues

Car's going down the street, no traffic jams to meet
This time of night they'll drive right through
And they all go right by and they don't know I cry
When it's midnight, me and the blues

Midnight's the loneliest time in the world
Me, I'm the loneliest guy with no girl
These blues began when it ended with you
Now it's midnight, me and the blues

Jet plane low overhead rumbles my lonely bed
Crumbles my lovely dreams of you
They don't care that you're gone or if midnight lasts till dawn
When it's midnight, me and the blues

Midnight's the loneliest time in the world
Me, I'm the loneliest guy with no girl
These blues began when it ended with you
Now it's midnight, me and the blues
Midnight, me and the blues"
Mel Tillis,The Arms of a Fool,"So many times you've told me that you love me
And just as many times I found that it's not true
So if you've had your fun and you still need someone
Come on home to the arms of a fool
My foolish eyes still cry when my ears believe a lie
And my foolish heart keeps sayin' I love you
So with your new flamed eyes and you're still burning with desire
Come on home to the arms of a fool

Now even if I'm standing in for someone
It's all right because I'm standing next to you
You'll find an open door and I'll take you back once more
Come on home to the arms of a fool
My foolish eyes still cry...
Come on home to the arms of a fool"
Mel Tillis,Burning Memories,"(Burning mem'ries burning mem'ries)
Tonight I'm burning old love letters photographs and memories of you
Hoping somehow I'll feel better and when the smoke is gone I won't want you
Burning mem'ries burning mem'ries memories of you that I can't use
My heart to you no longer matters and I can't live on memories
Into the fire those dreams you've shattered
And when the smoke is gone then I'll be free
(Burning mem'ries burning mem'ries)"
Mel Tillis,What Did I Promise Her Last Night,"There she lies still sleeping
Dreaming the whole world is in her hands
What she thought was love last night
Was just the wine and the weakness in a man

But now the passion's gone and all that's left
Is cold gray facts and cold gray morning light
As I promptly close the door I wonder
What did I promise her last night

I guess I should have wakened her
And told her that I must be moving on
But I told myself the truth might hurt her
Worse than waking up to find me gone

But my conscience knows the truth
And it's so hard to convince myself I'm right
And as I slowly drive away
I wonder what did I promise her last night

I guess by now she's waking up
And packing up her things and heading home
With memories of a temporary love
She wishes never came along

How many one-night stands must she go through
Before she finds a love that right?
And as I'm driving down the road I wonder
What did I promise her last night

I guess by now she's waking up
And packing up her things and heading home
With memories of a temporary love
She wishes never came along

How many one-night stands must she go through
Before she finds a love that right?
And as I'm driving down the road I wonder
What did I promise her last night"
Mel Tillis,Stateside,"Well the Japany's moon is bright tonight and Tokio is full of life
Busy people everywhere but busy people just don't care
I wanna go stateside oh Lord I wanna go stateside
In and out the honky tonks but nothing's there I really want
Sat awhile and look around get up and leave and walk the town
I wanna go stateside oh Lord I wanna go stateside

The giashy girls don't understand the lonely life of a service man
When his heart is far away to a girl in the USA
I wanna go stateside oh Lord I wanna go stateside
I've heard say a man don't cry but I can't keep my blue eyes dry
I've been away about two years I know I've cried a million tears
I wanna go stateside oh Lord I wanna go stateside oh Lord I wanna go stateside"
Mel Tillis,Stomp Them Grapes,"Stomp, stomp them grapes and make that wine
Put it in a bottle, boys, and ship it on down the line

Well, I got up this morning and made it downtown
Started mighty early just makin' my rounds
Well, I had me a woman she left me alone
I got to lose these blues before I take myself back home

So stomp, stomp them grapes and make that wine
Put it in a bottle, boys, and ship it on down the line
I said stomp, stomp them grapes and make that wine
'Cause there's a trouble man in trouble with a woman on his mind

Yesterday she loved me, today it's history
Why she should want to leave me is a deep dark mystery
I may not find the answer but I find me a jug
'Cause I'm gonna do some drinkin', boys, it's really got me fog

So stomp, stomp them grapes and make that wine
Put it in a bottle, boys, and ship it on down the line
I said stomp, stomp them grapes and make that wine
There's a trouble man in trouble with a woman"
Mel Tillis,I Ain’t Never,"[Chorus]
Well, I ain't never, I ain't never
Seen nobody like you, no, no, no
Never have I ever
Seen nobody like you

[Verse 1]
Lord, you call me up and say, ""Meet me at nine
I'll have to hurry, hurry, but I'm there on time
I walk right up and I knock on your door
The landlord says, ""She ain't a-here no more""

[Chorus]
I ain't never, oh, darlin'
Seen nobody like you, woop-woop
But I love you, god, I love you, girl
I love you just the same

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Well, you tell me sweet things that you don't mean
You got me living in a haunted dream
You make me do things I don't wanna do
My friends ask me, ""Tillis, what's wrong with you""

[Chorus]
I ain't never, oh, darlin'
Seen nobody like you, woop-woop
But I love you, god, I love you, girl
I love you just the same
Love you just the same
Love you just the same"
Mel Tillis,Ruby Don’t Take Your Love to Town,"You've painted up your lips and rolled and curled your tinted hair
Ruby are you contemplating goin' out somewhere
The shadow on the wall tells me the sun is going down
Oh Ruby don't take your love to town
It wasn't me that started that old crazy Asian war
But I was proud to go and do my patriotic chores
And yes it's true I'm not the man that I used to be
Oh but Ruby I still need some company
It's hard to love a man whose legs are bent and paralized
And the wants and the needs of a woman your age Ruby I realize
But it won't be long I've heard them say until I'm not around
Oh Ruby don't take your love to town
She's leaving now cause I just heard the slamming of the door
The way I know I've heard it slam one hundred times before
And if I could move I'd get my gun and put her in the ground
Oh Ruby don't take your love to town Ruby for God sake's turn around"
Mel Tillis,Kissing Your Picture,"Kissing your picture is so cold
Pictures have no arms that I can hold
Living with a heartache for a friend
Wondering if I'll ever hold you in my arms again

A thousand blue thoughts every day
Looks like my heartache's here to stay
New lips offer me no thrill
Only your lips ever will

Kissing your picture is so cold
Pictures have no arms that I can hold
Living with a heartache for a friend
Wondering if I'll ever hold you in my arms again

I turn your picture to the wall
If I fall I could forget it all
But from your love I can't be free
And this picture's all that's left for me

Kissing your picture is so cold
Pictures have no arms that I can hold
Living with a heartache for a friend
Wondering if I'll ever hold you in my arms again
Wondering if I'll ever hold you in my arms again"
Mel Tillis,Life Turned Her That Way,"If she seems cold and bitter I beg of you
Just stop and consider all she's gone through
Don't be quick to condemn her for things she might say
Just remember life turned her that way
She's been stepped on and walked on so many times
And I hate to admit it but that last footprint's mine
She was crying when I met her she cries harder today
So don't blame her life turned her that way

She's been stepped on..."
Mel Tillis,Heaven Everyday,"If an angel wears a housewife's dress
And fills a home with happiness
One wakes me gently every morning
And serves my coffee with a kiss

My life is heaven everyday
Because of all the love you give
Your smile drives all my cares away
And makes life heaven everyday

If heaven is all they say
I know for certain I've found mine
Your tender touch and understanding
Makes my life heaven all the time

My life is heaven everyday
Because of all the love you give
Your smile drives all my cares away
And makes life heaven everyday"
Mel Tillis,These Lonely Hands Of Mine,"Any girl who hangs out in a honky-tonk
Who smokes my cigarettes and drinks my wine
Some call her a bad girl but to me she means the world
Cause she's holding these lonely hands of mine

She listens while I cry on her shoulder
She runs her slender fingers through my hair
Other men may hold her tight, but right now tonight
She's holding these lonely hands of mine

She's holding the hands that once held you so tight
She smiles each time I call her by name
She listens to my same sad story every night
She says I'm right and she gives you the blame

Any girl who hangs out in a honky-tonk
Who smokes my cigarettes and drinks my wine
Some call her a bad girl but to me she means the world
Cause she's holding these lonely hands of mine
Holding these lonely hands of mine"
Mel Tillis,Loco Weed,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up steed
In the mornin' you will get
A bale of loco weed

Now ole Jimmy Jackie was a ring tail tooter
He could shoot nine times from a colt 6 shooter
He got a wild one night and he threw his a lasso
Surrounded the whole town of El Paso

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up steed
In the mornin' you will get
A bale of loco weed

Now Jack cut his teeth on a 45 slug
His mama weaned him on a white lightin' jug
He rode upon a big a red eyed steed
A fed that horse a steady diet of them a loco weed

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up nag
I'd buy you some oats
But you ain't worth a bag

He rode into Dodge and he drank about a keg
A told Chester he was gonna break his other leg
A Chester run to the Marshall said stop that villain
Jack said you don't want none of me Mister Dillon

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up nag
I'd buy you some oats
But you ain't worth a bag

Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up nag
I'd buy you some oats
But you ain't worth a bag

Luke Bryan,Most People Are Good,"[Verse 1]
I believe kids oughta stay kids as long as they can
Turn off the screen, go climb a tree, get dirt on their hands
I believe we gotta forgive and make amends
'Cause nobody gets a second chance to make new old friends

I believe in working hard for what you've got
Even if it don't add up to a hell of a lot

[Chorus]
I believe most people are good
And most mamas oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better under neon or stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Ain't nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world ain't half as bad as it looks
I believe most people are good

[Verse 2]
I believe them streets of gold are worth the work
But I'd still wanna go even if they were paved in dirt
I believe that youth is spent well on the young
'Cause wisdom in your teens would be a lot less fun
I believe if you just go by the nightly news
Your faith in all mankind would be the first thing you lose

[Chorus]
I believe most people are good
And most mamas oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better under neon or stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Ain't nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world ain't half as bad as it looks
I believe most people are good

[Bridge]
I believe that days go slow and years go fast
And every breath's a gift, the first one to the last

[Chorus]
I believe most people are good
And most mamas oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better under neon or stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Ain't nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world ain't half as bad as it looks
I believe most people are good

[Outro]
I believe most people are good
I believe most people are good"
Luke Bryan,Country Girl (Shake It for Me),"[Intro]
Hey girl
Go on now
You know you've got everybody lookin'

[Verse 1]
I got a little boom in my big truck
Gonna open up the doors and turn it up
Gonna stomp my boots in the Georgia mud

Tangle me up like grandma's yarn

Luke Bryan,Rain is a Good Thing,"[Verse 1]
My daddy spent his life lookin' up at the sky
He'd cuss, kick the dust, sayin', ""Son, it's way too dry""
It clouds up in the city, the weatherman complains
But where I come from, rain is a good thing

[Chorus]
Rain makes corn, corn makes whiskey
Whiskey makes my baby feel a little frisky
Back roads are boggin' up, my buddies piled up in my truck
We hunt our hunnies down, we take 'em into town
Start washin' all our worries down the drain
Rain is a good thing

[Verse 2]
Ain't nothing like a kiss out back in the barn
Wringing out our soakin' clothes, ridin' out a thunderstorm
When the tin roof gets to talkin', that's the best love we make
Yeah, where I come from, rain is a good thing

[Chorus]
Rain makes corn, corn makes whiskey
Whiskey makes my baby feel a little frisky
Back roads are boggin' up, my buddies piled up in my truck
We hunt our hunnies down, we take 'em into town
Start washin' all our worries down the drain
Rain is a good thing

[Bridge]
Farmer Johnson does a little dance
Creeks on the rise, roll up yo pants
Country girls, they want to cuddle
Kids out playin' in a big mud puddle

[Chorus]
Rain makes corn, corn makes whiskey
Whiskey makes my baby— Hahahaha
Back roads are boggin' up, my buddies piled up in my truck
We hunt our hunnies down, we take them into town
Start washin' all our worries down the drain
Rain is a good thing

[Outro]
Rain is a good thing
Rain is a good thing
Rain is a good thing"
Luke Bryan,What She Wants Tonight,"[Verse 1]
She walks up, velvet rope unhooks
She snaps her fingers and a drink comes
She locks you down with just one look
She's got this whole club undone
If she's on the rebound, you ain't gonna know it
Coming off a heartbreak, she ain't gonna show it
She's eyes caught, red dot, locked on me, yeah

[Chorus]
She wants my hands on her body
She wants to burn like she's made of fire
Said she ain't going home 'til we
Drink every drop of Kentucky dry
Don't even know what she'll do when she does it
Palm of her hand, I'm hers in the blink of an eye
She don't take no and I love
She gets what she wants
And I get to be what she wants tonight
I get to be what she wants tonight

[Verse 2]
I get to catch all her secrets
Sequins bouncing off flashing lights
If she wants it, then we're leaving
Get me home, park the truck, cut the tires
I get to be where she goes when she's lonely
The last door of the night she's closing
Oh, I know she could have anything, but

[Chorus]
She wants my hands on her body
She wants to burn like she's made of fire
Said she ain't going home 'til we
Drink every drop of Kentucky dry
Don't even know what she'll do when she does it
Palm of her hand, I'm hers in the blink of an eye
She don't take no and I love
She gets what she wants
And I get to be what she wants tonight
I get to be what she wants tonight

[Bridge]
And I don't know how I got to be
The only thing she needs right now, uh

[Chorus]
She wants my hands on her body
She wants to burn like she's made of fire
Said she ain't going home 'til we
Drink every drop of Kentucky dry
Don't even know what she'll do when she does it
Palm of her hand, I'm hers in the blink of an eye
She don't take no and I love
She gets what she wants
And I get to be what she wants tonight
I get to be what she wants tonight (Tonight), yeah
I get to be what she wants tonight, tonight"
Luke Bryan,That’s My Kind of Night,"[Verse 1]
I got that real good, feel good stuff
Up under the seat of my big black jacked up truck
Rollin' on 35's, pretty girl by my side
You got that sun tan skirt and boots
Waiting on you to look my way and scoot
Your little hot self over here
Girl hand me another beer, yeah!

[Chorus]
All them other boys want to wine you up and take you downtown
But you look like the kind that likes to take it way out
Out where the corn rows grow, row, row my boat
Floatin' down the Flint River, catch us up a little catfish dinner
Going to sound like a winner, winner, when I lay you down and love you right
Yeah, that's my kind of night!

[Verse 2]
Might sit down on my diamond plate tailgate
Put in my country-rock, hip-hop mixtape
Little Conway, a little T-Pain, might just make it rain
You can hang your t-shirt on a limb
Hit that bank and we can ease on in
Soak us up a little moonlight
You know I know what you like, yeah!

[Chorus]
All them other boys want to wine you up and take you downtown
But you look like the kind that likes to take it way out
Out where the corn rows grow, row, row my boat
Floatin' down the Flint River, catch us up a little catfish dinner
Going to sound like a winner, winner, when I lay you down and love you right
Yeah, that’s my kind of night!
Yeah, that’s my kind of night!

[Bridge]
My kinda-- your kind-- is this kind of night
We dance in the dark and your lips land on mine
Oh oh oh oh oh, gonna get our love on
Oh oh oh oh oh, time to get our buzz on

[Chorus]
All them other boys want to wine you up and take you downtown
But you look like the kind that likes to take it way out
Out where the corn rows grow, row, row my boat
Floatin' down the Flint River, catch us up a little catfish dinner
Going to sound like a winner, winner, when I lay you down and love you right
Yeah, that’s my kind of night!

[Outro]
Yeah, that's my kind of night!
That's my kind of night!
Yeah, that's my kind of night!
Come on"
Luke Bryan,Play It Again,"[Verse 1]
She was sittin' all alone over on the tailgate
Tan legs swingin' by a Georgia plate
I was lookin' for her boyfriend
Thinkin', ""no way, she ain't got one""
Soon as I sat down, I was fallin' in love
Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off

[Chorus]
She was like, ""Oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is""
She was like, ""Come here, boy, I wanna dance""
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' me around 'til it faded out
And she gave me a kiss
And she said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""
And I said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""

[Verse 2]
I'da gave that DJ my last dime
If he would have played it just one more time
But a little while later
We were sittin' in the drive in my truck
Before I walked her to the door
I was scannin' like a fool; AM, FM, XM too
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove
Man, you should have seen her light up

[Chorus]
She was like, ""Oh my God, this is my song
We've been listenin' to the radio all night long
I can't believe that it came back on, but here it is""
She was like, ""Come here boy, I wanna dance""
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights, she gave me a goodnight kiss
And I said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""
And she said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""

[Bridge]
The next Friday night we were sittin' out under the stars
You should have seen her smile when I broke out my guitar

[Chorus]
She was like, ""Oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is""
She was like, ""Come here boy, I wanna dance""
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights, she gave me a goodnight kiss
And she said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""
And I said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""

[Outro]
Yeah, play it again, play it again, play it again
Somebody play it again, play it again, play it again"
Luke Bryan,Light It Up,"[Verse 1]
I open my eyes, reach for the phone
Not a word from you baby
It don’t leave my sight since we had that fight
Can’t remember but maybe
I blew you up
In the middle of the night again
You were drinking with your friends
You ignored it but you got it

[Chorus]
I get so neurotic about it baby
‘Cause I know you’re reading your phone
I can’t help from going crazy
Thinking you might not be all alone
I wake up, I check it, I shower and I check it
I feel the buzz in my truck
And I almost wreck it
I always got it on me
Just in case you want me
So, if you’re looking for my love
Then light it up

[Verse 2]
Every time I unlock my screen
I hope I see one of them red lipstick ‘I miss you’ pictures
I’m on your clock, you’re in control
You want me now baby go figure
My worlds at the tips of your fingers

[Chorus]
I get so neurotic about it baby
‘Cause I know you’re reading your phone
I can’t help from going crazy
Thinking you might not be all alone
I wake up, I check it, I shower and I check it
I feel the buzz in my truck
And I almost wreck it
I always got it on me
Just in case you want me
So, if you’re looking for my love
Then light it up
Yeah baby, then light it up

[Chorus]
I go to sleep, I check it
In the middle of the night, I check it
I feel the buzz in my bed
And I don’t get no rest
I always got it on me
Just in case you want me
So, if you’re looking for my love
Then light it up
Yeah baby, light it up"
Luke Bryan,Drunk on You,"[Verse 1]
Cottonwood fallin' like snow in July
Sunset, riverside, four wheel drives in a tail light circle
Roll down the windows, turn it on up
Pour a little crown in a dixie cup
Get the party started

[Chorus]
Girl, you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mm-mm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money maker gotta be
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey, I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime

[Verse 2]
If you ain't a 10, you're a 9.9
Tippin' n' spillin' that home-made wine
On your tied up T-shirt
Every little kiss is drivin' me wild
Throwin' little cherry bombs into my fire
Good God almighty

[Chorus]
Girl, you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mm-mm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money maker gotta be
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey, I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime

[Bridge]
Let's slip on out where it's a little bit darker
And when it gets a little bit hotter
We'll take it off on out in the water

[Chorus]
Girl, you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mm-mm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money maker gotta be
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey, I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime

[Outro]
Yeah, I'm a little drunk on you"
Luke Bryan,Strip It Down,"[Verse 1]
Let it fade to black
Let me run my fingers down your back
Let's whisper, let's don't talk
Baby, leave my t-shirt in the hall
Like a needle finds a groove
Baby, we'll remember what to do
To drown out every distraction
It's time we made it happen

[Chorus]
Strip it down, strip it down
Back to you and me like it used to be
When it was an old back road with an old school beat
Cowboy boots by your little bare feet
Let it out, tell me right now
Everything I need in them white cotton sheets
Dirty dance me slow in the summertime heat
Feel my belt turn loose from these old blue jeans
We both know that we lost it somehow
Let's get it found
Strip it down, down, down

[Verse 2]
I wanna drop this cell phone now
And let it shatter on the ground
They ain’t holdin’ nothin’, these two hands
Until they’re holding you again

[Chorus]
Oh, strip it down, strip it down
Back to you and me like it used to be
When it was an old back road with an old school beat
Cowboy boots by your little bare feet
Let it out, tell me right now
Everything I need in them white cotton sheets
Dirty dance me slow in the summertime heat
Feel my belt turn loose from these old blue jeans
We both know that we lost it somehow
Let’s get it found
Strip it down, down, down
Strip it down, down, down

[Bridge]
I don’t wanna let you go
No, not tonight
I just wanna love you so bad, baby
So let's close our eyes

[Chorus]
And strip it down, strip it down
Back to you and me like it used to be
When it was an old back road with an old school beat
Cowboy boots by your little bare feet
Let it out, tell me right now
Everything I need in them white cotton sheets
Dirty dance me slow in the summertime heat
Feel my belt turn loose from these old blue jeans
We both know that we lost it somehow
Let’s get it found
Strip it down, down, down
Strip it down, down, down
Strip it down, down, down
Strip it down, down, down"
Luke Bryan,Drink a Beer,"[Verse 1]
When I got the news today
I didn't know what to say
So I just hung up the phone
I took a walk to clear my head
This is where the walking lead
Can't believe you're really gone
Don't feel like going home

[Chorus]
So I'm gonna sit right here
On the edge of this pier
Watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer

[Verse 2]
Funny how the good ones go
Too soon, but the good Lord knows
The reasons why, I guess
Sometimes the greater plan
Is kinda hard to understand
Right now it don't make sense
I can't make it all make sense

[Chorus]
So I'm gonna sit right here
On the edge of this pier
Watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer

[Bridge]
So long my friend
'till we meet again
I'll remember you
And all the times that we used to...

[Chorus]
Sit right here
On the edge of this pier
Watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer
Drink a beer, yeah"
Luke Bryan,Kick the Dust Up,"[Intro]
Kick the dust up, c'mon

[Verse 1]
All week long it’s a farmin’ town
They’re makin’ that money grow
Tractors, plows with flashing lights
Backin’ up a two lane road
They take one last lap around
That sun up high goes down
And then it's on, come on
Girl kick it on back
Z71 like a Cadillac

[Chorus]
We go way out where
There ain’t nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin’ up a back road song
Park it and we pile out
Baby, watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up
Back it on up
Fill your cup up
Let’s tear it up, up
And kick the dust up (kick the dust up...)

[Verse 2]
Bar downtown they got a line
Of people way out the door
$10 dollar drinks, it’s packed inside
I don’t know what they’re waitin for
Got me a jar full of clear
And I got that music for your ears
And it’s like knock, knock, knock goes the diesel
If you really wanna see the beautiful people

[Chorus]
We go way out where
There ain’t nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin’ up a back road song
Park it and we pile out
Baby, watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up
Let's back it on up
Fill your cup up
Let’s tear it up, up
And kick the dust up (c'mon)

[Bridge]
Just follow me down ‘neath the 32 bridge
Y'all be glad you did (kick it)

[Chorus 2]
We go way out where
There ain’t nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin’ up a back road song
Park it and we pile out
Baby watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up
Back it on up
Fill your cup up
That’s what’s up, up
Let’s kick the dust up"
Luke Bryan,To the Moon and Back,"[Verse 1]
Through the dirt and the gravel
Through the years and the miles
Every road that you traveled
Through the tears and the smiles
Through the clear and the muddy
Through the thick and thin
The quiet nights, the howling wind
Through the good and the ugly
The blue and the black
To the ends of the Earth
To the moon and back

[Verse 2]
Through all of the words
The mean and the kind
Through the strings that unravel
And the ties that bind
From the crazy and the different
To the more of the same
From the coast is clear
To a hurricane
Yeah, I'll be right beside you
On a roll or off the tracks
To the ends of the Earth
To the moon and back
To the moon and back

[Verse 3]
Through the bitter and the sweet
The cold and the fire
Lonely cotton sheets
And the burning desire
Until our song is over
Til the stars all fade to black
I'm gonna love you
To the ends of the Earth
To the moon and back
Yeah, I'm gonna love you
All the way to the moon and back
To the moon and back"
Luke Bryan,"Huntin’, Fishin’ and Lovin’ Every Day","[Intro]
Woah, woah-whoa
Mm-mm

[Verse 1]
If I could make a livin' from walkin' in the woods
You can bet I'd be sittin' pretty good
High on a hill lookin' at a field downwind
If I could make a nickel off of turning 'em bass
Never worry 'bout the price of gas
I'd be wheelin' and dealin' and sittin' there reelin' 'em in

[Chorus]
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
That's the prayer that a country boy prays
Thank God, He made me this way
Huntin', and fishin' and lovin' every day
Early in the mornin', late in the evenin'
I'm gettin' red dirt rich and Flint River paid
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day

[Verse 2]
I get a little Farm Pond buzz
Sound of gravel when I'm backin' up
Pullin' the string on a nine point nine two-stroke, Mercury
I love it when my baby wants to roll with me
Throws her boots on, climbs in a tree
Tuckin' her hair in my hat, and she's ready to go

[Chorus]
And we get to huntin', fishin', lovin' every day
That's the prayer that a country boy prays
Thank God, He made me this way
Huntin', and fishin' and lovin' every day
Early in the mornin', late in the evenin'
I'm getting red dirt rich, and Flint River paid
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day, yeah
Woo

[Bridge]
So while y'all are up there
Breathin' in that old dirty air
I'll be down here, knee-deep, in the Muckalee (Ha)
Huntin' and fishin', lovin' every day
I wanna see them tall pines sway
Y'all close them eyes
Let's go there in our mind

[Chorus]
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day
That's the prayer this country boy prays
Thank God, He made me this way
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day
Black coffee in the mornin', dark whiskey in the evenin'
I'm gettin' red dirt rich and Flint River paid
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day (Woo)
Come on

[Outro]
Won't you come along with me
Won't you come along with me
I know you wanna see
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day, yeah"
Luke Bryan,One Margarita,"[Verse 1]
Everybody here ain't from here
But we're here doin' our thing
Lettin' go a little, little by little
Sippin' on a frozen drink

[Pre-Chorus]
Tiki bars tik'n, pourin' all weekend
Clouds ain't leakin' no rain
Two pieces shakin', white caps a-breakin'
We ain't feelin' no pain, it goes like

[Chorus]
One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, shot
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow, leave all your sorrow out here on the floatin' dock
When that sun lays down, we'll be on our way
One more barefoot round, one more last chance to say
""Hey, señorita, don't you think we need a salt and a Buffett song?""
One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, we'll be gone

[Verse 2]
Ice blue skies, shades on the eyes
To tuck the bloodshot away
Hair of the dog, shouldn't take long
But who cares, we got all day
Palm trees a-leanin', sunburn screamin'
But we'll all be alright, after

[Chorus]
One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, shot
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow, leave all your sorrow out here on the floatin' dock
When that sun lays down, we'll be on our way
One more barefoot round, one more last chance to say
""Hey, señorita, don't you think we need a salt and a Marley song?""
One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, we'll be gone

[Post-Chorus]
We'll be gone

[Pre-Chorus]
Tiki bars tik'n, pourin' all weekend
Clouds ain't leakin' no rain
Two pieces shakin', white caps a-breakin'
We ain't feelin' no pain, feelin' no pain
It goes like

[Chorus]
One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, shot
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow, leave all your sorrow out here on the floatin' dock
When that sun lays down, we'll be on our way
One more barefoot round, one more last chance to say
""Hey, señorita, don't you think we need a salt and a Chesney song?""
One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, we'll be gone

[Post-Chorus]
We'll be gone
We'll be gone"
Luke Bryan,Fast,"[Verse 1]
Fast
That's the kind of car you wanna drive when you're sixteen
Fast
That's the kind of boys that you want on your home team
Fast
Yeah, you think you're gonna catch your big dreams just like that
Fast
And here you are, looking back

[Chorus]
Sixty seconds now feels more like thirty
Tick-tock, won't stop, around it goes
Sand through the glass sure falls in a hurry
All you keep trying to do is slow it down, soak it in
You're trying to make the good times last as long as you can
But you can't, man
It just goes too fast

[Verse 2]
Fast
That's what your parents said when we were falling in love
It's too fast
There ain't no way the two of us were ever going to last
But we did, and here we are, and our only problem is

[Chorus]
Sixty seconds now feels more like thirty
Tick-tock, won't stop, around it goes
Sand through the glass sure falls in a hurry
All you keep trying to do is slow it down, soak it in
You're trying to make the good times last as long as you can
But you can't, man
It just goes too fast

[Bridge]
Looking at you looking out the window right now
Those eyes, that dress, that smile, that laugh
If I could hit pause, I would somehow
But it don't work like that

[Chorus]
Sixty seconds now feels more like thirty
Tick-tock, won't stop, around it goes
Sand through the glass sure falls in a hurry
All you keep trying to do is slow it down, soak it in
You're trying to make the good times last as long as you can
But you can't, man
It goes too fast
It just goes too fast
Way too fast"
Luke Bryan,Home Alone Tonight,"[Intro: Karen Fairchild & Luke Bryan]
Oh
Oh

[Verse 1: Luke Bryan & Karen Fairchild]
What you doing in this place?
Well, I could probably ask you the same thing
Another round, girl, what you think?
If you're buying, well, you know I'll drink
So make it seven on seven
Do you want it on the rocks?
A double shot of heaven
Spilling out the top

[Chorus: Luke Bryan & Karen Fairchild, Karen Fairchild & Luke Bryan]
And we'll go shot for shot for shot
'Til we forgot what we came here to forget
Ain't a clock, a tick, a tock that's gonna stop
A night we won't regret
So put your drink down, throw your camera up
Flip it around and snap a payback picture
I'll send it to my ex, I'll send it to my ex
And send 'em both a text saying
""We ain't going home alone tonight""
Girl, you ain't gotta, I ain't gotta go
Home alone tonight

[Verse 2: Luke Bryan & Karen Fairchild]
Slow country from a cover band
I got you covered if you don't know how to dance
But if you want, we could grab a cab
Girl, we got all night, I got a bottomless tab

[Chorus: Luke Bryan & Karen Fairchild, Karen Fairchild & Luke Bryan]
So let's go shot for shot for shot
'Til we forgot what we came here to forget
Ain't a clock, a tick, a tock that's gonna stop

It feels too good to let it end right here
I ain't going home alone tonight
So let's not let it end, let it end right here
Girl, you're going home with me tonight

So let's go shot for shot for shot
'Til we forgot what we came here to forget

Luke Bryan,Knockin’ Boots,"[Verse 1]
This truck needs a half tank
These wheels need a two-lane
This radio needs three songs to play
To get me 'cross town to you
That dress needs to slip off
That hair needs to come down
Friday nights need to do
What Friday nights need to do
That's the truth

[Chorus]
Yeah, birds need bees and ice needs whiskey
Boys like me need girls like you to kiss me
""Fishin' in the Dark"" needs Nitty Gritty
Under that pale moon
Sweet tea needs that sugar stirrin'
Small town nights need both ends burnin'
Shades need drawin', hearts need fallin'
Boots need knockin', knockin' boots
Knockin' boots, me and you, oh

[Verse 2]
Long weeks need a weekend
Cheap drinks need a-slingin'
That dance floor needs some me on you
And you on me tonight
Singalongs need to be sung
Tip bells need to be rung
Last calls need a call that cab
And backseats need I want you so bad

[Chorus]
Yeah, birds need bees and ice needs whiskey
Boys like me need the girls like you to kiss me
""Fishin' in the Dark"" needs Nitty Gritty
Under that pale moon
Sweet tea needs that sugar stirrin'
Small town nights need both ends burnin'
Shades need drawin', hearts need fallin'
Boots need knockin', knockin' boots
Knockin' boots, girl, me and you

[Bridge]
Doors need shuttin'
Lights need cuttin'
Lips need lockin'
Boots need knockin'

[Chorus]
And birds need bees and ice needs whiskey
Boys like me need girls like you to kiss me
""Fishin' in the Dark"" needs Nitty Gritty
Under that pale moon
Sweet tea needs that sugar stirrin'
Small town nights need both ends burnin'
Shades need drawin', hearts need fallin'
Boots need knockin', knockin' boots
Mmm, knockin' boots, me and you, oh
Knockin' boots"
Luke Bryan,Build Me a Daddy,"[Verse 1]
A boy walks past a window of a glowin' open sign
Full of wooden toys and trucks and painted trains
Rings a bell up on the counter, hands a picture to the man
Of a kid beside a soldier smiling away
Said, ""Sir, I've heard you can build anything""

[Chorus]
Could you build me a daddy?
Strong as Superman
Make him ten feet tall with a southern drawl
And a crooked smile if you can
'Cause I sure miss him
Maybe you could bring him back
If I walked in with him, it'd sure make mama happy
If you could build me a daddy

[Verse 2]
There's an old Winchester rifle, back home hangin' on the wall
He promised me he'd teach me how to aim
And he said when I got older, we could work on that curveball
I know he'd never wanna miss a game
So here's a little money that I've saved

[Chorus]
Could you build me a daddy?
Strong as Superman
Make him ten feet tall with a southern drawl
And a crooked smile if you can
I sure miss him
Maybe you could bring him back
If I walked in with him, it'd sure make mama happy
If you could build me a daddy

[Bridge]
Give him a big heart, make his arms wide open
I know he misses me, so mister, I was hopin'

[Chorus]
You could build me a daddy
Strong as Superman
Make him ten feet tall with a southern drawl
And a fishing pole in his hand
'Cause I sure miss him
Maybe you could bring him back?
If I walked in with him, it'd sure make my mama happy
If you could you build me a daddy

[Outro]
Could you build me a daddy?"
Luke Bryan,What Makes You Country,"[Verse 1]
People talkin' ’bout what is and what ain’t country
What gives ’em the right to wear a pair of beat-up boots?
Is it the size of your tires and your fires, or your wild ass buddies?
Well, give me a minute, let me hit you with some hometown truth

[Pre-Chorus]
You could be a cowboy on the Texas plain
Or a plowboy waitin’ on the rain
We’re all a little different, but we’re all the same
Everybody doin' their own thing

[Chorus 1]
I got my dirt road cred when I was twelve
On a no cab tractor hauling them bales
Backing in boats, fishing limb lines
Running bird dogs through the Georgia pines
Step side cover down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight, and that was us
It might not have been you, but I can't judge
Just be proud of what makes you country

[Verse 2]
Does it run in your blood?
Did it come from your daddy and mama?
Were you converted by an Alabama song on the radio?
That feels so right
Did you lock eyes with a little green-eyed girl from Jackson?
Tell me what got ya, I just gotta know

[Chorus 2]
Me, I got my Sunday learning in a live oak church
Silver Queen corn in a backyard dirt
Waiting for the fall to finally come along
So I can grab my gun and get my outside on
Step side cover down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight, and that was us
It might not have been you, but I can't judge
Just be proud of what makes you country

[Brdge]
Might be from a city or a little farm town
Whatever kind of square that you drove around
Do you wear it on your sleeve or keep it deep down?
You know you gotta let it out

[Chorus 1]
I got my dirt road cred back when I was twelve
On a no cab tractor hauling them bales
Backing in boats, fishing limb lines
Running bird dogs through them Georgia pines
Step side cover down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight, and that was us
It might not have been you, but I ain't judging
And just be proud of what makes you country
Whatever makes you country

[Outro]
You do your kind of country
They doing they kind of country
I do my kind of country
Whatever makes us country"
Luke Bryan,Do I,"[Verse 1]
Baby, what are we becomin'?
It feels just like we're always runnin'
Rollin' through the motions every day

[Verse 2]
I could lean in to hold you
Or act like I don't even know you
Seems like you could care less either way

[Pre-Chorus]
What happened to that girl I used to know?
I just want us back to the way we were before

[Chorus]
Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you, baby?
Does the sight of me wantin' you drive you crazy?
Do I have your love? Am I still enough?
Tell me, don't I? Or tell me, do I, baby?
Give you everything that you ever wanted?
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely?
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life?
Baby, do I?

[Verse 3]
Remember when we didn't have nothin'
But a perfect simple kind of lovin'?
Baby, those sure were the days

[Pre-Chorus]
There was a time our love ran wild and free
But now I'm second guessin' everything I see

[Chorus]
Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you, baby?
Does the sight of me wantin' you drive you crazy?
Do I have your love? Am I still enough?
Tell me, don't I? Or tell me, do I, baby
Give you everything that you ever wanted?
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely?
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life?
Baby, do I

[Bridge]
Still give you what you need?
Still take your breath away?
Light up the spark way down deep?
Baby, do I?!

[Chorus]
Whoa! Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you, baby?
Does the sight of me wantin' you drive you crazy?
Do I have your love? Am I still enough?
Tell me, don't I? Or tell me, do I, baby
Give you everything that you ever wanted?
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely?
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life?
Tell me, baby, do I get one more try?
Do I?
Baby, do I?"
Luke Bryan,Crash My Party,"[Verse 1]
It don't matter what plans I got, I can break 'em
Yeah, I can turn this thing around at the next red light
And I don't mind tellin' all the guys I can't meet 'em
Hell, we can all go raise some hell on any other night
Girl, I don't care, oh, I just gotta see what you're wearin'
Your hair, is it pulled up or fallin' down?
Oh, I just have to see it now

[Chorus]
If you wanna call me, call me, call me (Call me, call me, call me)
You don't have to worry 'bout it, baby
You can wake me up in the dead of the night
Wreck my plans, baby, that's alright
This is a drop everything kind of thing (Drop everything)
Swing on by, I'll pour you a drink
The door's unlocked; I'll leave on the lights
Baby, you can crash my party anytime

[Verse 2]
Ain't a spot downtown that's rockin' the way that you rock me
Ain't a bar that can make me buzz the way that you do
I could be on the front row of the best show
And look down and see your face on my phone
And I'm gone so long, hang on
I'll meet you in a minute or two

[Chorus]
If you wanna call me, call me, call me (Call me, call me, call me)
You don't have to worry 'bout it, baby
You can wake me up in the dead of the night
Wreck my plans, baby, that's alright
This is a drop everything kind of thing (Drop everything)
Swing on by, I'll pour you a drink
The door's unlocked; I'll leave on the lights
Baby, you can crash my party anytime

[Bridge]
If it's two in the mornin' and you're feelin' lonely
And wonderin' what I'm doing

[Chorus]
Go ahead and call me, call me, call me (Call me, call me, call me)
You don't have to worry 'bout it, baby
You can wake me up in the dead of the night
Wreck my plans, baby that's alright
This is a drop everything kind of thing (Drop everything)
Swing on by, I'll pour you a drink
The door's unlocked; I'll leave on the lights
Baby, you can crash my party anytime
(Call me, call me, call me)
Baby, you can crash my party anytime"
Luke Bryan,I Don’t Want This Night to End,"[Verse 1]
Girl, I know I don't know you
But your pretty little eyes so blue
Are pullin' me in
Like the moon on your skin
I'm so glad you trusted me
To slide up on this dusty seat
And let your hair down
And get out of town

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Got the stars comin' out over my hood
And all I know now is it's going good

[Chorus]
You got your hands up
You're rockin' in my truck
You got the radio on
You're singin' every song
I'm set on cruise control
I'm slowly losin' hold
Of everything I've got
You're looking so damn hot

[Post-Chorus]
And I don't know what road we're on
Or where we've been
From starin' at you, girl
All I know is I don't want this night to end

[Verse 2]
Gonna cuss the mornin' when it comes
'Cause I know that the risin' sun
Ain’t no good for me
'Cause you'll have to leave
Gonna make the most of every mile
Do anything to make your smile
Land on my lips
Get drunk on your kiss

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Clock on the dash says 3:35
There's plenty of gas, and the night's still alive

[Chorus]
You got your hands up
You’re rockin' in my truck
You got the radio on
You're singin' every song
I'm set on cruise control
I'm slowly losin' hold
Of everything I've got
You're looking so damn hot

[Post-Chorus]
And I don't know what road we're on
Or where we've been
From starin' at you, girl
All I know is I don't want this night to end

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
You got your hands up
You're rockin' in my truck
You got the radio on
You're singin' every song
I'm set on cruise control
I'm slowly losin' hold
Of everything I've got
You're looking so damn hot

[Post-Chorus]
And I don't know what road we're on
Or where we've been
From starin' at you, girl
All I know is I don't want this night to end

[Outro]
I don't want this night to end
No, I don’t want this night to end"
Luke Bryan,"Sunrise, Sunburn, Sunset","[Verse 1]
Your daddy had a lakehouse
He had me paint it that summer sophomore year
Said I could stay for free
A couple buddies, a couple weeks
You rode in in a little red Honda
And headed straight for the pier
Tank top and cutoff jeans
A little PacSun underneath
Who knew it was 'bout to be

[Chorus]
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Moonlight, all night, crashing into me
Nothing will ever be easy as you and me
Tangled up with nowhere to be
Just sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat, ayy

[Verse 2]
I turned those shutters the color of your eyes
'Til the day turned into night
And took turns with a jar
Turn that boat dock into a bar
And then we passed the guitar around the fire to each other
And watched all of our friends pair off with one another
But we felt like the stars we were under
And everybody knew that that was our summer

[Chorus]
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Moonlight, all night, crashing into me
Nothing will ever be easy as you and me
Tangled up with nowhere to be
Just sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Yeah

[Bridge]
Whoa
We set July on fire
Whoa
Yeah, girl, you and I were
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat

[Chorus]
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Moonlight, all night, crashing into me
Nothing will ever be easy as you and me
Tangled up with nowhere to be
Just sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Yeah

[Outro]
Whoa
We set July on fire
Whoa
Yeah, girl, you and I were
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat"
Luke Bryan,"Love You, Miss You, Mean It","[Verse 1]
We were small-town meant to be
My momma loved her, her daddy loved me
We burned up the road between her house and mine
We'd kiss in her driveway
And by the time I hit the highway
She called to tell me goodnight one more time

[Chorus]
And she'd say, ""Love you, miss you, mean it
Boy, I'll see you when I'm dreamin'
I can't wait to feel you hold me again
Till then, I'll be countin' down the minutes
I'll be climbin' up these walls
Your kiss, I want it, need it
Love you, miss you, mean it, baby""

[Verse 2]
When graduation came
UGA was callin' her name
We thought two hundred miles wasn't nothin' we couldn't get through
But after that first fall
The time got longer between the calls
And I couldn't help but wonder what happened to

[Chorus]
My little love you, miss you, mean it
Girl, I'll see you when I'm dreamin'
I can't wait to feel you hold me again
Till then I'll be countin' down the minutes
I'll be climbin' up these walls
Your kiss, I want it, need it
Love you, miss you, mean it, baby, yeah
(Woo, uh)

[Bridge]
Years went by, pages got turned
But I never did forget about her
Late one night, out of the blue
My phone lit up and my heart did too

[Chorus]
She said, ""I don't know about you
But I love you, miss you, meant it
I still see you when I'm dreamin'
I just wanna feel you hold me again
And I've been countin' down the minutes
I'll keep climbin' up these walls
Your kiss, I want it, need it
Love you, miss you, mean it, baby""

[Outro]
(Love you, miss you, mean it)
Love you, miss you, mean it, baby
(Love you, miss you, mean it)
Love you, miss you, mean it, baby"
Luke Bryan,Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye,"[Verse 1]
All we do right is make love
And we both know now that ain’t enough

[Chorus]
Ain’t gonna beg you to stay
Ain't gotta ask you what's wrong
Ain’t no reason running after something already gone
Take off your leavin' dress
Let’s do what we do best
I guess everybody’s got their way of moving on
Girl rest your head one more time in my bed
Love me like you loved me when you loved me
And you didn’t have to try
Let’s lay down tonight
And kiss tomorrow goodbye

[Verse 2]
Baby who we are just didn’t work
But maybe we can leave with something out of all this hurt

[Chorus]
Ain’t gonna beg you to stay
Ain’t gotta ask you what’s wrong
Ain’t no reason running after something already gone
Take off your leavin' dress
Let’s do what we do best
I guess everybody’s got their way of moving on
Girl rest your head one more time in my bed
Love me like you loved me when you loved me
And you didn’t have to try
Let’s lay down tonight
And kiss tomorrow goodbye

[Chorus]
Ain’t gonna beg you to stay
Ain’t gotta ask you what’s wrong
Ain’t no reason running after something already gone
Take off your leavin' dress
Let’s do what we do best
I guess everybody’s got their way of moving on
Girl rest your head one more time in my bed
Love me like you loved me when you loved me
And you didn’t have to try
Let’s lay down tonight
And kiss tomorrow goodbye
Let’s kiss tomorrow goodbye"
Dottie West,What Are We Doin’ in Love,"[Verse 1]
We're like summer and winter
We're not one bit alike
We're like satin and cinders
I'm definitely not your type

[Chorus]
Well, then what are we doin' in love?
What are we doin' in a mess like this?
What are we doin' in love?
Why were you someone I couldn't resist?
What are we doin' in love?

[Verse 2]
We're like paper and matches
We'll probably have our share of fights
We're like roses and switches
It's gonna be hard but we've got to try

[Chorus]
So what are we doin' in love?
What are we doin' in a mess like this?
What are we doin' in love?
And what are we gonna tell all our friends?

[Bridge]
You don't have to like someone to love someone
That rule was made to be broken
But if we have to say goodbye to a life we've gotten used to
What are we doin' in love then?

[Verse 3]
We're like sun up and sun down
People say we're never gonna last
Like uptown and downtown
You like it slow, but I like it fast

[Chorus]
What are we doin' in love?
What are we doin' in a mess like this?
What are we doin' in love?
What are we gonna tell all our friends?
What are we doin' in love?
What are we doin' in a mess like this?
What are we doin' in love?
You were just someone I couldn't resist

[Outro]
So that's what we're doin' in love"
Dottie West,Country Sunshine,"I love you please believe me
I wouldn't want you to ever leave me
But I was raised on country sunshine

I was raised on country sunshine, green grass beneath my feet
Runnin' through fields of daisies a wadin' through the creek
You love me and it's invitin' to go where life is more excitin'
But I was raised on country sunshine
I was raised on country sunshine
I'm happy with the simple things
A Saturday night dance, a picture show
And the joy that the bluebird brings

I love you please believe me
I wouldn't want you to ever leave me
But I was raised on country sunshine

There's just something bout the mornin'
Makes each day a joy to see
Night time brings a peaceful feelin' to rest inside of me

I love you please believe me
I wouldn't want you to ever leave me
But I was raised on country sunshine

Oh I love you please believe me
Uh huh, I was raised on country sunshine
Oh, oh I was raised on country sunshine"
Dottie West,A Lesson In Leavin’,"Somebody's gonna give you
A lesson in leavin'
Somebody's gonna give you back
What you've been givin'
And I hope that I'm around
To watch 'em knock you down
It's like you to love 'em and leave 'em
Just like you loved me and left me
It's like you to do that sort of thing
Over and over again
You're a fool-hearted man

I hear you've been askin' about me
From some of my friends
Well, you'd better believe
I'm not goin' through that again
You're the kind of man
A woman thinks she can change
Oh, but the only thing changin'
Is my way of thinkin'
And I'm thinkin' that maybe someday

Somebody's gonna give you
A lesson in losin'
Somebody's gonna do to you
What you've been doin'
And I hope that I'm around
To watch 'em knock you down
Somebody's gonna give you
A lesson in hurtin'
Somebody's gonna leave you
With your fire burnin'
And no way to put it out
Baby, there ain't no doubt
You're a fool-hearted man

Yeah, you're the kind of man
A woman thinks she can change
But the only thing changin'
Is my way of thinkin'
And I'm thinkin' that maybe someday

Somebody's gonna give you
A lesson in leavin'
Somebody's gonna give you back
What you've been givin'
And I hope that I'm around
To watch 'em knock you down
It's like you to love 'em and leave 'em
Just like you loved me and left me
It's like you to do that sort of thing
Over and over again
You're a fool-hearted man

Somebody's gonna give you
A lesson in leavin'
Somebody's gonna give you back

Dottie West,"Mommy, Can I Still Call Him Daddy","Come here, my precious little boy
Mommy loves you so
We've got big things to talk about
Some things you have to know

And though you're only four years old
I know you understand
That from now on
You've got to be mommy's little man

Your daddy left for good today
But we'll make it just the same
And pretty soon
We'll both forget we even wear his name

(Please, Mommy
Can I still call him Daddy
I know he's treated us so bad
Please, Mommy
Can I still call him Daddy
For he's the only daddy I ever had)

Now, sweetheart
You must forget 'cause he doesn't love you like before
But knowing that he doesn't care
Just makes mommy love you more

So come on now
And let's be big and strong
And please, please don't cry
Cause he doesn't deserve your tears
Cause when he left
He didn't even say you goodbye
(Please, Mommy
Can I still...)"
Dottie West,Here Comes My Baby,"Here comes more tears to cry
Here comes more heartaches by
Here comes my baby, back again
Here comes more misery
Here comes old memories
Here comes my baby, back again

My arms are open wide to let more hurt inside
Here comes my baby back again
He's sorry once again, once more I'll understand
Here comes my baby, back again

My arms are open wide to let more hurt inside
Here comes my baby, back again
He's sorry once again, once more I'll understand
Here comes my baby, back again

Here comes my baby, back again"
Dottie West,Last Time I Saw Him,"Last time I saw him, he sweetly kissed my lips
Last time I saw him, he said, ""I'll be back for more of this""
Last time I saw him, we were crying at the bus
I knew he hated leaving but he had to set us up

I gave him money, I know I invested well
Mama doesn't trust him but he loves me, I can tell
Each day the Greyhound arrives at nine o'clock
But I don't start my crying 'til that last man's gotten off

Last time I saw him, last time I saw my honey
Last time I saw him, he was Greyhound bound
But I'm still waiting here without a fear
That bus will someday turn around

I've had no letter, it's been six months maybe better
I tried forgettin' him, but I love him more than ever
I have decided I've waited long enough
If there was nothing wrong he would return right on that bus
There must be trouble so I'm leavin' on the double
If he can't get to me I know he needs me desperately

Last time I saw him, last time I saw my honey
Last time I saw him, he was looking fine
And as he waved goodbye, he said, ""Don't cry
I'm coming back come rain or shine""

Last time I saw him, last time I saw my honey
Last time I saw him, he was looking fine
And as he waved goodbye, he said, ""Don't cry
I'm coming back come rain or shine""

Last time I saw him, last time I saw my honey
Last time I saw him, he was looking fine
And as he waved goodbye, he said, ""Don't cry
I'm coming back come rain or shine"""
Dottie West,Would You Hold It Against Me,"Would you hold it against me
If I just see him one more time
Just so I can make certain
I can leave him behind

Would it make any difference
If I just called him once again
Now you know that I love you
But have I forgotten him

He was my love 'til you came my way
Now I can't help but wonder
Have I made a mistake?
Just suppose
I remember things he used to say
After our wedding day

Would you hold it against me
If I just see him once again
Then I'll know that I love you
And that I've forgotten him

For he was my love 'til you came my way
So I can't help but wonder
Have I made a mistake?
Just suppose
I remember the things he used to say
After our wedding day

Would you hold it against me
If I just see him once again
Then I'll know that I love you
And that I've forgotten him"
Dottie West,Paper Mansions,"Don't build for me no paper mansions that only stand until you've gone
You've paint the nasiest futures of anyone I know
You always leave me holding on to pretty words that glow
You've built a thousand mansions out of dreams that seemed so strong
But they're always made of paper not of stone
Don't build for me no paper mansion that I can never call my own
For love can't live in paper mansions that only stand until you've gone

You've always been a dreamer dear and I'm a dreamer too
But I guess I've had too many of the time that don't come true
So don't build me no mansion with paper walls so thin
That only stand until you leave again
Don't build for me..."
Dottie West,Then I Met the Master,"Then I met the Master
Now I am one of his own

Like a baby that cries for its mother
Like a child I was helpless in this world alone
Then I met the Master
Now I am one of his own

For all things were changed when he found me
A new day broke through all around me
Then I met the Master
Now I am one of his own

For all things were changed...
Yes, I met the Master
Now I am one of his own"
Dottie West,Reno,"Along the wild Texas border, was no law and order
When Reno brought me to this land
He was after the wild ones, the mustangs, the shy ones
And hoping that I'd understand

But there's too many long nights, a wife should have some rights
It seems that it's so plain to see
Reno my husband, oh, he loves the wild ones
Much more than he'll ever love me

He's riding somewhere out there with his raven black hair
And a heart that is loving and wild
He's too much afire with ambitious desire
To be tied to a wife and a child

The horses are cunning, they soon will be running
And Reno will always be gone
These things I'm knowing, the Rio is flowing
And Reno, I'm goin' back home

'Cross the Mexican border, my house all in order
I wait for a knock on my door
Little Juan, the small one, the son of the tall one
So peacefully plays on the floor

But what are these yearnings that always keep burning?
I feel so deeply inside
My love for Reno, my flashing young gringo
Has suddenly vanquished my pride

He's riding somewhere out there with his raven black hair
And a heart that is loving and wild
He's so much afire and with too much desire
To be alone without a wife and a child

The horses are cunning, they soon will be running
And Reno will quickly be gone
There's no more waiting, no more hesitating
Oh, Reno, I'm coming back home
Wait Reno, I'm coming back home"
Dottie West,You’re The Other Half Of Me,"You're the other half of me
You're the eyes through which I see
All alone
I'm only half a girl
That with you
I can be
You're the other half of me

Things I begin
They always end
Half started things
I say always sound half parted

I'm as helpless as a baby bird
Above that's fallen from a tree
You're the other half of me
You're the other half...
You're the other half of me"
Dottie West,When It’s Just You and Me,"You like to mix with people, I like to be alone
Baby you can stay out all night, and I'd just as well stay home
Two people with so little in common, and different as we can be
We come together around midnight when it's just you and me
When it's just you and me and there's nothing between us Oh, but our own sweet love
When it's time to be tender and try to remember what we're doin' here
Baby, I don't mind we're not two of a kind, just so we agree
Sometime long 'round midnight when it's just you and me
You love to hear the music, you just get up and dance around
Baby, you can act so crazy, you turn it up way too loud
Oh, I've got my share of hang-ups but you never seem to see
And as we come together 'round midnight when it's just you and me
When it's just you and me and there's nothing between us Oh, but our own sweet love
When it's time to be tender and try to remember what we're doin' here
Baby, I don't mind we're not two of a kind, just so we agree
Sometime long 'round midnight when it's just you and me"
Dottie West,(I’m So) Afraid of Losing You Again,"Sometimes I want to throw my arms around you
Then I tremble at the thought of giving in
Because I know how much it cost to love you and I'm so afraid of losing you again
Being close to you revives the sorrow that wakes me up and tells me I can't win
I'd love to wake up in your arms tomorrow but I'm so afraid of losing you again

If heaven were to hear my heart's confession wanting you would be my greatest sin
But I'm glad that you're no longer my possession
Cause I'm so afraid of losing you again
Being close to you...
I'm so afraid of losing you again"
Dottie West,Touch Me,"Touch me, touch the girl who once held
All the world in her hand
Touch me, touch the arms of the girl
That once held the world's finest man

Touch me, maybe someday you may need
To know how you feel when you lose
So touch me and you'll know
How you feel with the blues

[Instrumental]

Watch me, watch the eyes that have seen
All the heartbreak and pain in the world
And be thankful that you're happy
Though standing so close to the world's bluest girl

Don't forget me, take a good look at someone
Who's lost everything she can lose
So touch me and you'll know
How you feel with the blues

(Touch me, touch me.)
Don't forget me, take a good look at someone
Who's lost everything she can lose
So touch me and you'll know
How you feel with the blues"
Dottie West,Country Girl,"I was born a country girl; I will die a country girl
My world is made of blue skies and sunshine
Green fields and butterflies
I'm so glad I'm a country girl
Birds sing good morning to a country girl
And I sleep to the sounds of whip-o-wills
My day is made with puppies and kittens meadows and daisies
I'm so glad I'm a country girl
Running over hills playing in the woods free breezes blowing
Honey bees are swarming, black birds are flying, wonder where they're going
Picking stick-me-tights off my gingham dress darkness is falling
Firewood to carry eggs to gather and supper?s ready mamma's calling
I was born a country girl and I will die a country girl
My world is made of blue skies and sunshine
Green fields and butterflies
I'm so glad I'm a country girl
Oh I'm so happy I'm a country girl"
Dottie West,Six Weeks Every Summer (Christmas Every Other Year),"Hopelessly the ghost of me sinks down into a chair
And underneath the cushion
There's a ribbon from her hair
Just a crumpled up reminder that my daughter's only here
For six weeks ever summer and Christmas every other year

The role of part-time mother it's the toughest role I play
Oh, my name's up there in neon lights
But Lord, what a price I pay
Why, the only thing it cost was giving up our used-to-be's
And my little angel baby by the name of Shelly

Bravely I step back into my room
It's only cheap veneer
And I die inside till summertime or Christmas time is near
When up the stairs comes
All my prayers yelling
Mom, it's me, I'm here
For six weeks every summer and Christmas every other year

Just found a note
My baby wrote she left it by the phone
She knew I'd need some extra strength
To make it through the night alone
It says I'll always love you mama
Although I'm only here
For six weeks every summer and Christmas every other year

Oh, I'd gladly give up all my fame
If only I could hear
My Shelly calls me mommy every morning of the year"
Dottie West,Fair Weather Lover,"Fair weather lover
That's what you've always been
My fair weather lover
You're leaving once again

When the sun is shining and everything looks rosy
This is when you say you love me so
But when a storm appears
Oh, it's all the different story
Just when I need you most of all
Fair weather lover

You're always by my side
And understand when I'm smiling
This is when you say you love me so
But when times are bad
Oh, it's all the different story
Just when I need you most of all

Fair weather lover...
Oh but this time it don't matter
Go find yourself another
It's farewell
Fair weather lover"
Dottie West,Pick Me Up On Your Way Down,"You were mine for just a while
Now you're putting on the style
And you've never once looked back to your home across the track
You're the gossip of the town
But my heart can still be found
Where you tossed it on the ground
Pick me up on your way down

Pick me up on your way down
When you're blue and all alone
When their glamour starts to bore you
Come on back where you belong
You may be their pride and joy
But they'll find another toy
Then they'll take away your crown
Pick me up on your way down

They have changed your attitude made you haughty and so rude
Your new friends can take the blame
Underneath you're still the same
When you've learned these things are true
I'll be waiting here for you
As you tumble to the ground
Pick me up on your way down
Pick me up on your way down..."
Dottie West,I’m Your Country Girl,"You say you found it easy
Pleasing your country girl
Her simple way of living's
Brought real love to your world
You say you found it easy
Pleasing your country girl
Her simple way of living's brought real love to your world

A home cook meals her French cafe
A night with you
Her Broadway play
And it really makes me happy
Knowing I'm your country girl

You tell her she's a pleasure
And the treasure in your arms
You love her warm and tender
Unsophisticated charms

There's no diamonds in her wedding ring
Wear your name's her claim to fame
And it really makes me happy
Knowing I'm your country girl

[strings]

They say you have your choice of girls
Why picked a girl like me
Yet, you took me out to places
For all your friends to see

You held my hand and called me dear
Your nights have always been sincere
And it really makes me happy
Knowing I'm your country girl
Yes, it really makes me happy
Knowing I'm your country girl"
Dottie West,Let Me Talk To You,"Just one more dance
Just one more chance
So I can talk to you

Don't live too fast forget the past
I will try to prove
I would do anything you ask me to
Don't run around
Don't turn me down
Let me talk to you

Don't go too far
With that crowd at the bar
That's not the way to win
Please fall in love again

Give me your heart
So I can start to build our life anew
I know you've paid
So if you're afraid let me talk to you

Don't go too far..."
Dottie West,Wish I Didn’t Love You Anymore,"Wish I could stop these tears
I wish I didn't care
Wish I didn't love you anymore
Wish I could be set free from all your memories
Wish I didn't love you anymore

But if wishing really made it
So I'd have the different wish I know
I'd wish you still love me
Just like you did before

But that wish can't come true
So all that I can do is wish I didn't love you anymore
Wish I could just forget that we had ever met
Wish I didn't love you anymore
How I wish I didn't love you anymore"
Dottie West,Suffertime,"After sundown comes suffertime for me
And I go to that small cafe where we used to meet
I'll have the special for today
Cause nothing matters to me
Just make my coffee cold and black
Oh, like my future's gonna be

And let me cry to a sad song for
He's still on my mind
And excuse me for not talking
It's my suffertime

I know I'll never crave a new love
I had a taste of one so fine
And for this love
I'll go on starving and suffer my whole lifetime

Oh, would you play just one more sad song
Yes, he's still still on my mind
Then I'll see you again
Tomorrow at suffertime"
Dottie West,Just Out of Reach,"Love that runs away from me
Dreams that just won't let me be
Blues that keep on bothering me
Chains that just won't set me free

Too far away from you
And all your charms
Just out of reach of my two empty arms
Each night in dreams
I see your face
Memories time cannot erase

Then I awake and find you gone
I'm so blue and all alone
So far away from lips so sweet and warm
Just out of reach of my two empty arms

That lonesome feeling all the time
Knowing you cannot be mine
Dreams that hurt me in my sleep
Vows that we could never keep
Too far away from you
And all your charms
Just out of reach of my two empty arms"
Dottie West,Are You Happy Baby,"Are you happy baby
After what you put me through
Hope you're happy baby
Cause I don't believe you're gonna find anyone
Who loves you better than I do
Sometimes I wonder if you ever knew
How much you were hurtin' me
You fell in love with someone else
And just like that you deserted me
Haven't seen you for so long
Thought I'd call
I wonder, are you happy baby
Do you miss me a all
Oo Oo before you go now
I just gotta know now
Are you happy baby
Is she there to stand by you
Was it worth it baby
Well I don't believe you're gonna find anyone
Who loves you better than I do
Some friends of yours and mine say lately
Things with you ain't been so good
I told you I would never take you back again
But you know I would
Doesn't matter anymore who was wrong
I wonder are you happy baby
Don't you wanna come home"
Dottie West,Route 65 to Nashville,"Thanks for the ride
Hey, Mister
It's nice
I look just like your sister

You'd like to show me a good time
I believe you
Thanks for the offer
But here's where I leave you

Route 65 to Nashville
I will pick it up just south of Lousville
It's on the right
The sign is green and wide
I know it's way around that next hill
Route 65 to Nashville

I've ran away to nowhere
Bright lights of city nights
I'd go there
I've learned the hard way you can't be happy hiding
My best of Broadway from here on in
I'm riding
Route 65 to Nashville

He was country folk like I am
I left to town and I left my man
And now I miss him
I've got to be believing
We still can make it
So here's where I'm leaving
Route 65 to Nashville

Route 65 to Nashville
Route 65 to Nashville
Route 65 to Nashville"
Earl Thomas Conley,Holding Her and Loving You,"[Verse 1]
It's the third hardest thing I'll ever do
Leavin' here without you
And the second hardest thing I'll ever do
Is tellin' her about you

[Chorus]
She's been good to me when things were goin' rough
How can I tell her now, that good ain't good enough
Oh, the hardest thing I've ever had to do
Is holdin' her and lovin' you

[Verse 2]
If she'd give me one good reason I'd be gone
But she ain't done, one thing wrong
So don't expect me to just walk out of the door
I still love her, but I love you more

[Chorus]
She's been good to me when things weren't goin' right
She made my days long before you made my nights
So, the hardest thing I'll ever have to do
Is holdin' her and lovin' you

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Yeah, the hardest thing I'll ever have to do
Is holdin' her and lovin' you
Girl, the hardest thing I'll ever have to do
Is holdin' her and lovin' you"
Earl Thomas Conley,Once In a Blue Moon,"Nine times of ten, she's right and I am wrong
When I won't give in she just goes along
Standing by my side, sitting home alone
I'll never know what keeps her hanging on
When anybody else would be long gone

But once in a blue moon I'll do something right
And Once in a blue moon I'll make her feel so fine
I can make her laugh, And make her cry
She hates the way she loves me sometimes
Once in a blue moon I'll do something right

She's starving for affection, so hungry for loves touch
But she only hears ""I love you"" when we're making love
Lord, I'll always wonder why she love me so much
And the best I'll ever do won't be enough
So I'll just thank my lucky stars above

But once in a blue moon I'll do something right
And Once in a blue moon I'll make her feel so fine
I can make her laugh, And make her cry
She hates the way she loves me sometimes
Once in a blue moon, once in a blue moon
Every once in a blue moon
I'll do something right
Once in a blue moon..."
Earl Thomas Conley,What I’d Say,"Talking to the mirror
Whispering your name
Just like you were here, you'd think I was insane
I hold these conversations in the silence of my room
Rehearsing all the things I'd say should I run into you

How's it going might be what I'd say
You broke my heart you know
Or it looks like rain today
Or maybe god I missed you since you went away
You're looking well
Or go to hell might be what I'd say

Theres times I feel so angry I'd put my fist right through the wall
Then there's times I've come so close to giving you a call
I love you and I hate you all at the same time
I pray that you'll come back to me before I lose my mind

How's it going might be what I'd say
You broke my heart you know
Or it looks like rain today
Or maybe god I missed you since you went away
You're looking well
Or go to hell might be what I'd say

Guess you'll have to wait until that day
To find out what I'd say

God I missed you since you went away
You're looking well
Or go to hell
Might be what I'd say"
Earl Thomas Conley,Fire and Smoke,"[Verse 1]
In and out of honky tonks, from one town to the next
But anything worth loving, Lord, just too hard to forget
Every day's another way of feeling more the same
Looks like I'll run out of highway before I outrun the rain

[Chorus]
But if there's fire and smoke
Ooh, what a rush I got when your love was hot
Oh, but I couldn't see that when the flame burned out
You'd leave a cold dark cloud, a raining down on me

[Verse 2]
So I'm reaching out to someone, wishing she was you instead
And everything I left behind was waiting up ahead
Pulling on the bottom, baby, looking back on you
'Cause any way's the right way, babe, as long as I pull through

[Chorus]
But if there's fire and smoke
Ooh, what a rush I got when your love was hot
Oh, but I couldn't see that when the flame burned out
You'd leave a cold dark cloud, a raining down on me

[Outro]
Yeah, when the flame burned out
You left a cold dark cloud a raining down, a raining down on me
(Ooh, raining down) Down on me
(Ooh, raining down) Raining down on me
(Ooh, raining down) Raining down on me"
Earl Thomas Conley,Smokey Mountain Memories,"Smokey Mountain memories
About my home in Tennessee
Yesterday keeps calling me
Calling me home
Mountains rising in my soul
Higher than the dreams I've known
Misty eyed, they cling to me, my Smokey Mountain memories

An old gray man with a dog asleep at his feet
Played a worn out fiddle full of melodies
He smiled with his eyes, but the lines on his face
Told me as much as the tunes he played
Talking 'bout my

Smokey Mountain memories
Pretty girl from Tennessee
I was such a fool to leave
Leave her all alone
Think about her in my dreams
Wonder if she thinks of me
I'll always hold her close to me in my Smokey Mountain memories

So mister play your fiddle please, play some mountain melodies
I been down a lonely road to far away from home
Nothing left to hold on to, made some plans but they fell through
Now there's nothing left for me, but my Smokey Mountain memories
I'm talking 'bout my

Smokey Mountain memories
About my home in Tennessee
Yesterday keeps calling me
Calling me home
Mountains rising in my soul
Higher than the dreams I've known
Misty eyed, they cling to me, my Smokey Mountain memories"
Earl Thomas Conley,That Was a Close One,"I loved her because she was there
And I knew along that it wasn't fair but I didn't care
Then I got the hell out of there
That was a close one

I kept my freedom intact got rid of the hassle and rid of the flack yeah I cut me some slack
And I never thought I'd want it back
And that was a close one

That was a close one
And if I hadn't of run she might have got away with my heart
So I played it smart
That was a close one
But I kept my cool never let down my guard
That was a close one

The winter of '79 was so cold and lonely I found a good woman she took me inside
And I swear to God I really tried
And that was a close one

Will there ever be a love of my life when I'm out of my pride And out of my mind in the nick of time
And when the feeling in here is fine
That's the close ones

That was a close one
And if I hadn't of run she might have got away with my heart
My precious heart
That was a close one
But I kept my cool and never let down my guard
That was a close one
(whew)

That was a close one
I love her because she was there
That was a close one

That was a close one
Winter of '79
That was a close one

That was a close one
She might have got away with my heart
That was a close one"
Earl Thomas Conley,Somewhere Between Right and Wrong,"[Verse 1]
Well I met her in a small town bar not far from home
She was having second thoughts about a man who was always gone
Said the only way to get to him was a telephone
So she held on to me when she couldn't hold her own

[Chorus]
She said I can be had but I can't be bought
And I can be bad boy but don't get caught
But I'd rather be loved than left alone
Than be here in the middle, somewhere between right and wrong

[Verse 2]
She said you know I never was the kind to spread it around
But I'll let you get to me as long as you don't let me down
Said I got the kind of love it takes to make it feel slow
But don't care how you get me there, just as long as I go

[Chorus]
She said I can be had but I can't be bought
And I can be bad boy but don't get caught
But I'd rather be loved than left alone
Than be here in the middle, somewhere between right and wrong

[Verse 3]
Yeah, it's her kind of love keeps me coming back time after time
Just like a beautiful song I can't get off my mind
But I worry a lot about love you have to wait on
And I got second thoughts about a woman who's always gone

[Chorus]
She said I can be had but I can't be bought
And I can be bad boy but don't get caught
But I'd rather be loved than left alone
Than be here in the middle, somewhere between right and wrong

[Instrumental Outro]"
Earl Thomas Conley,Right from the Start,"The first time that I met you I was sure as sure it could be
Don't ask me how but there was no doubt you were the one for me
Love was intuition is a feeling you just can't fight
So I follow through with my plans for you
And now I know that I was right

Right from the start I had this feeling in my heart
Baby I knew you were right for the part
Right from the start

Don't you remember me saying our love was sure to grow
Well that's just what it did and you've got to admit
Baby I told you so

Right from the start I had this feeling in my heart
Baby I knew you were right for the part
Right from the start

I guess I shouldn't say anything
I've never been right before
But there's a first time for everything
And this time my heart was sure

Oh right from the start I had this feeling in my heart
Baby I knew you were right for the part

Right from the start I had this feeling in my heart
Baby I knew you were right for the part"
Earl Thomas Conley,You Must Not Be Drinking Enough,"I can see that you haven't recovered from the girl who let you down
You'd say one is left of you so pour another go round
You keep telling yourself she means nothing
Maybe you should call her bluff
You don't really believe it, you must not be drinking enough

Oh the perfume she wore you can buy now and the five and dime
But on some other woman it don't smell the same in your mind
You keep telling yourself you can take it
Telling yourself that you're tough
But you still want to hold her you must not be drinking enough

You're not drinking enough to wash away old memories
And there ain't enough whiskey in Texas to keep you from begging please, please, please
She passed on your passion, stepped on your pride, turns out you ain't quite so tough
Cause you still want to hold her, you must not be drinking enough

Aye aye aye aye
Ask yourself why

You still want to hold her, you must not be drinking enough

Aye aye aye aye
Aye aye aye aye

Oh you still want to hold her, you must not be drinking enough

Boy you still want to hold her, you must not be drinking enough"
Earl Thomas Conley,Brotherly Love,"We shared the same last name and the same color eyes
But we fought like tigers over that old red bike
""I'm battin' first and you can't use my glove.""
It wouldn't take long until push came to shove
But we looked out for each other
With brotherly love

You hated girls 'til I had my first date
I brought her home from the movies; you stayed up late
Three on the couch watchin' T.V
I was smilin' at her while you were laughin' at me
But, I wouldn't trade it for nothin'
Brotherly love

There's a bond that brothers know
And it gets stronger as they grow
A love that time and miles can't come between
We disagree but in the end
There will never be two closer friends
And brotherly love is something we all need

They share the same last name and the same color eyes
But they fight like tigers over one ol' red bike
And lookin' at them reminds me of us
They're gonna fight and they're gonna fuss
But, they've got something special
It's brotherly love

Yeah, they've got something special
It's brotherly love"
Earl Thomas Conley,I Can’t Win For Losing You,"Hey how you been? It's good to see you again
Gee it's been a long time
How's that new man, mama and dad?
Since I told you goodbye

Well I'm still the same, still raising cane
Nobody's worried about me
I come and I go, just as I please
Since I set myself free

But I can't win for losing you, I just can't get over you
Being foot loose and fancy free, ain't all it's creaked to be
And the grass ain't no greener here on the other side
I might win a heart or two but I can't win for losing you

Well I'm on my way, there's so much to say
Lord knows that I've had my time
But girl you can bet, I'll never forget
When you used to be mine

But I can't win for losing you, I just can't get over you
Being foot loose and fancy free, ain't all it's creaked to be
And the grass ain't no greener here on the other side
I might win a heart or two but I can't win for losing you

No, I can't win for losing you I just can't get over you
Being foot loose and fancy free"
Earl Thomas Conley,Nobody Falls Like A Fool,"[Verse 1]
The heart isn't blind
It just sees what it wants to see
I hope yours is lookin' at mine
The way that you're lookin' at me
Girl, I've been around
I've taken chances before
But this time, I'm hopin' for more
You're makin' it easy

[Chorus]
Nobody falls like a fool
Nobody loves like a believer
After so many dreams have fallen through
It's time that one came true
Nobody falls like a fool
Nobody loves like a believer
And I'm fallin'
'Cause I believe in you

[Verse 2]
I know you're afraid
Of the words we have spoken
There's been so many promises made
And so many broken
Oh, but please don't hold back
I've already opened the door
And this time, I'm hopin' for more
You're makin' it easy

[Chorus]
Nobody falls like a fool
Nobody loves like a believer
After so many dreams have fallen through
It's time that one came true
Nobody falls like a fool
Nobody loves like a believer
And I'm fallin'
'Cause I believe in you
Nobody falls like a fool
Nobody loves like a believer
After so many dreams have fallen through
It's time that one came true
Nobody falls like a fool
Nobody loves like a believer"
Earl Thomas Conley,Shadow of a Doubt,"Can't take back the angry words we've said
Can't forget the bitter tears we've shed
Just can't seem to get along
Even though the feelings strong
This lovin' hours just cannot move ahead

We always seem to come back home
Can't be bad enough at all
Must be something we can't do without
With the best behind us now
There's no way in and no way out
Living in the shadow of a doubt

Have we pasted the point of no return?
We can't cross the bridges that we've burned
Does it matter any more, is it still worth fighting for?
Or have we gone as for as we're concerned?

We always seem to come back home
Can't be bad enough at all
Must be something we can't do without
With the best behind us now
There's no way in and no way out
Living in the shadow of a doubt

With the best behind us now
There's no way in and no way out
Living in the shadow of a doubt
Just living in the shadow of a doubt"
Earl Thomas Conley,Heavenly Bodies,"[Verse 1]
Way up in the sky, moon and planets fly
Comets streak and shooting stars fall down
But I'm just sitting here, sipping on my second beer
And doing my stargazing on the ground

[Chorus]
Where all those heavenly bodies come out at night to play
Heavenly bodies that just take my breath away, yeah, baby
I'm gonna sit here from now until closing time
Just working on making your heavenly body all mine

[Verse 2]
Pretty blondes walk by, sexy smiles say hi
But how's a man to choose the one that's right
Then my eyes saw you and my body knew
That I just found my angel for tonight

[Chorus]
Where all those heavenly bodies come out at night to play
Heavenly bodies that just take my breath away, yeah, baby
I'm gonna sit here from now until closing time
Just working on making your heavenly body all mine
Where all those heavenly bodies come out at night to play
Heavenly bodies that just take my breath away, yeah, baby
I'm gonna sit here from now until closing time
Just working on making your heavenly body all mine

[Outro]
Just working on making your heavenly bodies all mine"
Earl Thomas Conley,Your Love’s On the Line,"[Verse 1]
You've never cheated, you've never lied
You've never had feelings that you've had to hide
For she's got you thinkin' of something so different tonight
It's too late to worry what's right or what's wrong
And you're a little too crazy to leave it alone
When you're lookin' at somethin' and it's too good to push it aside

[Chorus]
Boy, she's got your head in the clouds
And your heart in a bind
So how come you're feelin' so proud
When your love's on the line?

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
You still think your first love's the best in your life
When you know you should hurry but you can't say goodbye
And you know you can't go back and feel like you're where you belong
Now the sweet taste of freedom is hard to control
When the touch of a woman's so tender to hold
She won't even let you remember how long you've been gone

[Chorus]
Boy, you've got your head in the clouds
And your heart in a bind
So how come you're feelin' so proud
When your love's on the line?
Yeah, you've got your head in the clouds
And your heart in a bind
So how come you're feelin' so proud
When your love's on the line?

Earl Thomas Conley,I Love the Way He Left You,"[Verse 1]
Girl, I hate the way he broke your heart
I hate to see you torn apart
I hate to see you take it so hard
Oh, but, girl I believe in destiny
I bless the day he set you free
And I know that it sounds selfish of me

[Chorus]
But I love the way he left you
I hate the way you hurt
I'd give my lucky stars above
If I'd have been there first
But don't you see he led you
Right into my arms
I'd tell you that I'm sorry
But I love the way he left you

[Verse 2]
Girl, I know that you still see his face
It's something that I can't erase
But that's a chance I'll just have to take
Whoa, and girl, I know it's gonna take some time
But I know you're gonna be all right
Once I drive him out of your mind

[Chorus]
I love the way he left you
I hate the way you hurt
I'd give my lucky stars above
If I'd have been there first
But don't you see he led you
Right into my arms
I'd tell you that I'm sorry

[Chorus]
But I love the way he left you
I hate the way you hurt
I'd give my lucky stars above
If I'd have been there first
But don't you see he led you
Right into my arms
I'd tell you that I'm sorry
But I love the way he left you"
Earl Thomas Conley,Finally Friday,"I got a hundred dollars smokin' in my billfold
I know I ought to save it but it's burnin' a hole
Right through my pocket and into my skin
Come Monday morning I'll be broke again

[Chorus]
It's finally Friday I'm free again
I got my motor runnin' for a wild weekend
It's finally Friday I'm out of control
Forget the western blues and let the good times roll

I've got a little sugar baby down the road
Sittin' on ready and rockin' on dough
We'll dance up a storm and later on tonight
Be workin' on doin' all the wrong things right

[Chorus]
Monday I'll be hurtin' with my head in a vice
Tuesday I'll be wonderin' if I'll ever survive
Wednesday and Thursday I'll be slowly tunin' in
Friday I'll be revvin' up my motor again

Finally Friday I'm free again
I got my motor runnin' for a wild weekend
It's finally Friday I'm out of control
Forget the western blues and let the good times roll

It's finally Friday
I got my motor runnin' for a wild weekend
It's finally Friday
Forget the western blues and let the good times roll"
Earl Thomas Conley,Love Out Loud,"I don't brag about you to everyone I meet
I don't sing you praise's in the crowd
Oh but deep inside my heart you're the most important part
Oh I'm just no good at love....... out....... loud

When you're here beside me
Deep......in my arms
I can't seem to get my feelings out
I know that you deserve
The tenderness of words
But I'm.... just no good at love..... out...... loud

Love out loud it don't come easy
Love out loud is hard for me
Deep inside my heart is singing
And reciting poetry
Please don't read my silence as a cause for any doubt
I'm just no good at love..... out..... loud

There's some real good talkers
I hear them every day
But I'm not sure they know what love's about
Oh, but everything I do is a silent ""I love you!""
And I'm just no good at love..... out..... loud

Love out loud it don't come easy
Love out loud is hard for me
Deep inside my heart is singing
And reciting poetry
Please don't read my silence as a cause for any doubt
I'm just no good at love
I'm just no good at love
I'm just no good at love..... out..... Loud

Love out loud
Love out loud
Love out loud"
Earl Thomas Conley,What She Is (Is A Woman In Love),"There's a lot of nice things
That he never told her
And he forgets to hold her
When she needs him sometimes

The promises he made her
He never got around to
Still the thought of leaving
Never crossed her mind

What she sees
Is only what she wants to
What she has
She thinks is enough
What she does
Is just look at the good things
And what she is
Is a woman in love

He forgets to call her
So he keeps her waiting
He's always breaking the plans that she's made
There's so many good things
That he never gave her
But it never mattered to her anyway

Cause what she sees
Is only what she wants to
What she has
She thinks is enough
And what she does
Is just look at the good things
And what she is
Is a woman in love

And he's just an ordinary guy
Like you and I
And she's looking at him with her heart
And not her eyes

What she sees
Is only what she wants to
What she has
She thinks is enough
What she does
Is just look at the good things
And what she is
Is a woman in love

What she sees
Is only what she wants to
What she has
She thinks is enough
What she does
Is just look at the good things
And what she is
Is a woman in love"
Earl Thomas Conley,Chance Of Lovin’ You,"Like a young and courageous fool
Ready to take on the night
You came dressed to kill all of the boys
And it looks like you've done enough right
You say that love is your only rule
It kinda comes from the heart
When it all comes down to what lovers do
You fall in love & just fall apart

But that's the chance you take with a lonely heart
That's the price you pay with a lonely heart
That's the game you play when there's nothin' to lose
And I could never refuse the chance of lovin' you

You're beginning to look like you're feelin' content
Just for one night of romance
If it wasn't for love, you'd still be my friend
And still put my heart in your hands

But that's the chance you take with a lonely heart
That's the price you pay with a lonely heart
That's the game you play when there's nothin' to lose
And I could never refuse the chance of lovin' you"
Earl Thomas Conley,Love Don’t Care (Whose Heart It Breaks),"I'm a lonely rider
She's the sole survivor of this love affair
But she don't care
She's a real heartbreaker
And I can't find a taker, no, that can compare
'Cause she's so rare
She never let me hurt for love
She gave me all she had
But that was only long enough
To go from good to bad

Oh but love don't care whose heart it breaks
It don't care who gets blown away
If it all falls through as a bad mistake
Love don't care whose heart it breaks

I can still remember
Every time I see her, I go back in time
And lose my mind
Yeah I'm a good pretender
I just can't believe her heart's no longer mine
It's so unkind
She never let me hurt for love
She gave me all she had
But that was only long enough
To go from good to bad

Oh but love don't care whose heart it breaks
It don't care who gets blown away
If it all falls through as a bad mistake
Love don't care whose heart it breaks

No, love don't care whose heart it breaks"
Earl Thomas Conley,Angel In Disguise,"[Verse 1]
You were just another pretty face in the crowd
I was just hangin' out
I wasn't ready for love when I looked in your eyes
You took me by surprise

[Pre-Chorus]
You weren't supposed to say that you loved me
You were just gonna stay for the night
I've never held a hand that could touch me
And leave me with stars in my eyes

[Chorus]
Woah, angel in disguise
You're just an angel in disguise

[Verse 2]
You've almost made it too easy for me to believe
That love could happen to me
But you're not afraid to show me how much you care
And prove your heart is there

[Pre-Chorus]
You weren't supposed to say that you loved me
You were just gonna spend the night
I've never held a hand that could touch me
And leave me with stars in my eyes

[Chorus]
Woah, angel in disguise
You're just an angel in disguise
Woah, angel in disguise
You're just an angel in disguise

Earl Thomas Conley,Don’t Make It Easy for Me,"[Verse 1]
You're on my mind
I'm in the dark
You're takin' your time
At fallin' apart

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you hold the night in your hands and you know it
I'll get it right if you give me the chance to get closer
I'd give you my heart if that's what you're after
I'd give you my love, and that's all the matters
Think it over

[Chorus]
That's all right with me
If you wanna play hard to please
Don't make it easy for me

[Verse 2]
I'm down on my knees (Down on my knees)
Take a look at me (Take a look at me)
I'm easy to please (Easy to please)
Baby, why can't you be? (Baby, why can't you be?)

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, you hold the night in your hands and you know it
I'll get it right if you give me the chance to get closer
I'd give you my heart if that's what you're after
I'd give you my love, and that's all the matters
Think it over

[Chorus]
Yeah, that's all right with me
If you wanna play hard to please
Don't make it easy for me
Girl, that's all right with me
If you wanna play hard to please
Don't make it easy for me

Earl Thomas Conley,I Have Loved You Girl (But Not Like This Before),"[Verse 1]
I have held you, girl
But you ain't never made me feel so good before
Mmm-mmm, love you some more
And I have kissed you, girl
But your lips ain't never tasted quite so sweet and warm
Mmm-mmm, sweet and warm
And I have loved you, girl
But I ain't never really loved you from the heart
But tonight, I'm gonna start

[Chorus]
Oh, with every touch, you're painting
Pretty pictures with your hands
Creating precious feelings
That my body understands
I can almost hear the music
Playing somewhere soft and low
I have loved you girl, mmm
But not like this before

[Chorus]
Oh, with every touch, you're painting
Pretty pictures with your hands
Creating precious feelings
That my body understands
I can almost hear the music
Playing somewhere soft and low
I have loved you girl, mmm
But not like this before
Yeah, I have loved you girl, mmm
But not like this before"
Earl Thomas Conley,Honor Bound,"[Verse 1]
Nothing's been said, nothing's been done
It's hard to see a difference between the rising and setting sun
But I can feel a change it's there in her touch
It's suttle but it's deep and it hurts us both so much
Me because I'm losing her and her because she feels

[Chorus]
She's honor bound, bound by promise that she made so long ago
But I love her so much that I can't let her know I know
Oh I know her pure heart made that promise
Honestly, oh but how long can her honor keep her bound to me

She's trying so hard, but it's taking it's toll
Trying to keep her heart warm with a love slowly growing cold
But who knows what is right when everything's wrong
No matter what I do now it won't matter when she's gone
But I how long can I keep holding her when she's only holding me

She's honor bound, bound by promise that she made so long ago
But I love her so much that I can't let her know I know
Oh I know her pure heart made that promise
Honestly, oh but how long can her honor keep her bound to me

Nothing's been said, nothing's been done
It's hard to see a difference between the rising and the setting sun"
Maren Morris,My Church,"[Verse 1]
I've cussed on a Sunday
I've cheated and I've lied
I've fallen down from grace
A few too many times
But I find holy redemption
When I put this car in drive
Roll the windows down and turn up the dial

[Chorus]
Can I get a hallelujah?
Can I get an amen?
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singin' every single verse
Yeah, I guess that’s my church

[Verse 2]
When Hank brings the sermon
And Cash leads the choir
It gets my cold, cold heart burnin'
Hotter than a ring of fire
When this wonderful world gets heavy
And I need to find my escape
I just keep the wheels rolling, radio scrolling
Until my sins wash away

[Chorus]
Can I get a hallelujah?
Can I get an amen?
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singin' every single verse
Yeah, I guess that’s my church

[Chorus]
Can I get a hallelujah?
Can I get an amen?
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singin' every single verse
Yeah, I guess that’s my church

Can I get a hallelujah?
Can I get an amen?
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
When I play the highway FM

Yeah, I guess that's my church"
Maren Morris,Rich,"[Intro]
La-a-a-a-a-di-da
La-a-a-a-a-di-da

[Verse 1]
If I had a dollar every time that I swore you off
And a twenty every time that I picked up when you called
And a crisp new Benjamin for when you're here then gone again
And a dollar every time I was right about you after all

[Pre-Chorus]
Boy, I'd be rich, head to toe Prada
Benz in the driveway, yacht in the water
Vegas at the Mandarin, high roller gambling
Me and Diddy drippin' diamonds like Marilyn
No, I wouldn't be drowning in all your IOUs
Every promise you made me would have some real value
'Cause all the little lies rolling off your lips
Is money falling from the sky...

[Chorus]
(Ka-ching, ka-ching)
Shit, I'd be rich
La-a-a-a-a-di-da
I'd be rich
La-a-a-a-a-di-da

[Verse 2]
If I had a dime every time that you crossed my mind
Well, I'd basically be sitting on a big ass pile of dimes
And all the times that you make my heart feel cheap
I might as well have won the lottery
All of this pain and me cursing your name
Would just turn into dollar signs

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'd be rich, head to toe Prada
Benz in the driveway, yacht in the water
Vegas at the Mandarin, high roller gambling
Me and Diddy drippin' diamonds like Marilyn
No, I wouldn't be drowning in all your IOUs
Every promise you made me would have some real value
'Cause all the little lies rolling off your lips
Is money falling from the sky...

Told myself I wouldn't do this again
But how much you wanna bet I'mma do this again?

Rich, head to toe Prada
Benz in the driveway, yacht in the water
Vegas at the Mandarin, high roller gambling
Me and Diddy drippin' diamonds like Marilyn
No, I wouldn't be drowning in all your IOUs
Every promise you made me would have some real value
'Cause all the little lies rolling off your lips
Is money falling from the sky...

Maren Morris,The Bones,"[Verse 1]
We're in the homestretch of the hard times
We took a hard left, but we're alright
Yeah, life sure can try to put love through it, but
We built this right, so nothing's ever gonna move it

[Chorus]
When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good

[Verse 2]
Call it dumb luck, but baby, you and I
Can't even mess it up, yeah, though we both tried
No, it don't always go the way we planned it
But the wolves came and went and we're still standing

[Chorus]
When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good
When the bones are good

[Bridge]
Bones are good, the rest, the rest don't matter (Baby, it don't really matter)
Paint could peel, the glass, the glass could shatter (Oh, the glass, oh, the glass could shatter)
Bones are good, the rest, the rest don't matter (Ooh)
Paint could peel, the glass, the glass could shatter (Yeah)

[Chorus]
When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain (Let it rain, let it rain)

Will blow right over while we stay put

Maren Morris,GIRL,"[Verse 1]
Man, this shit's unflatterin', all up in my head again
I don't feel myself right now, maybe I should just lay down
If vanity's my vitamin, well, I don't feel the difference
I don't like myself right now, gotta find a way out

[Pre-Chorus 1]
What you feel is natural
But I don't wanna feel this anymore
Pick yourself up off the kitchen floor
What you waitin' for?

[Chorus 1]
Girl, won't you stop your cryin'?
I know that you're tryin'
Everything's gonna be okay
Baby girl, don't you hang your head low
Don't you lose your halo
Everyone's gonna be okay

Draw your comparisons, tryin' to find who's lesser than
I don't wanna wear your crown, there's enough to go around

Pick yourself up off the kitchen floor (Oh)

Maren Morris,80s Mercedes,"[Verse 1]
Still runs good, built to last
Moves like a hula girl on the dash
She ain't made for practicality
Yeah, I guess she's just like me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It's Saturday night, about time to go
Got my white leather jacket and a neon soul
Once I turn on the radio, I'm ready to roll, r-ready to roll

[Chorus]
Feel like a hard-to-get starlet when I'm driving
Turning every head, hell, I ain't even trying
Got them Ray-Ban shades, pretty in pink
Call me old school, but hey
I'm a 90s baby in my 80s Mercedes
I'm a 90s baby in my 80s Mercedes

[Verse 2]
Pop the top down like a summer dream
She's my teenage time machine
Just keeps getting sweeter with age
She's classic through any decade

[Pre-Chorus 2]
The sun's in the sky, glitter on the seats
You can try, but the Benz is hard to beat
So, hey, if you want you can ride with me, r-ride with me

[Chorus]
Feel like a hard-to-get starlet when I'm driving
Turning every head, hell, I ain't even trying
Got them Ray-Ban shades, pretty in pink
Call me old school, but hey
I'm a 90s baby in my 80s Mercedes
I'm a 90s baby in my 80s Mercedes

Turning every head, hell, I ain't even trying

Maren Morris,Dear Hate,"[Verse 1: Maren Morris]
Dear Hate
I saw you on the news today
Like a shock that takes my breath away
You fall like rain, cover us in drops of pain
I'm afraid that we just might drown

[Verse 2: Maren Morris]
Dear Hate
Well, you sure are colorblind
Your kiss is the cruelest kind
You could poison any mind
Just look at mine
Don't know how this world keeps spinning 'round and 'round

[Chorus: Maren Morris & Vince Gill]
You were there in the garden, like a snake in the grass
I see you in the morning staring through the looking glass
You whisper down through history and echo through these halls
But I hate to tell you, love's gonna conquer all

[Verse 3: Vince Gill]
Dear Hate
You were smiling from that Selma bridge
In Dallas, when that bullet hit and Jackie cried
You pulled those towers from the sky
But even on our darkest nights
The world keeps spinning 'round

[Chorus: Maren Morris & Vince Gill]
You were there in the garden, like a snake in the grass
I see you in the morning staring through the looking glass
You whisper down through history and echo through these halls
But I hate to tell you, love's gonna conquer all

[Bridge: Maren Morris]
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh

[Breakdown: Maren Morris]
Dear Love
Just when I think you've given up

[Chorus: Maren Morris & Vince Gill]
You were there in the garden when I ran from your voice
I hear you every morning through the chaos and the noise
You still whisper down through history and echo through these halls
And tell me love's gonna conquer all
Gonna conquer all"
Maren Morris,Once,"[Verse 1]
Darling, we, we were too gone to save
Couldn't get through the night, so we had to call it a day
The words came out; they couldn't be erased
Saw the pain in your eyes, and I knew everything would change

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a traitor, I'm the cause
I'm the breaker of your heart
I ain't saying what you want
But baby, please, know that if

[Chorus]
Somehow we make it alive
And both get out on the other side
Know this might be asking a lot
When it's all said and done, don't forget that you loved me once

[Verse 2]
It's been months; I'm still seeing signs of you
Things that you wanted me to read, shit you wanted me to do
If I'm left in the deepest part of your mind, it's cool
Oh, it's cool

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, it hurts, I agree
You're still the first part of me
I know I set you free
But baby, please, know that if

[Chorus]
Somehow we make it alive
And both get out on the other side
Know this might be asking a lot
When it's all said and done, don't forget that you loved me once

[Chorus]
Somehow we make it alive
And both get out on the other side
Oh, this might be asking a lot
When it's all said and done, don't forget that you loved me once
I know this might be asking a lot
When it's all said and done, don't forget that you loved me once"
Maren Morris,To Hell & Back,"[Verse 1]
Smoke was coming off my jacket and you didn't seem to mind
I left a long trail of ashes and you said, ""I like your style""
Now, heartbreak ain't a competition, but I took it in a landslide
The skeletons I wanted to bury, you liked out in the light

[Chorus]
You didn't save me
You didn't think I needed saving
You didn't change me
You didn't think I needed changing
My wings are frayed and what's left of my halo's black
Lucky for me, your kind of heaven's been to Hell and back
To Hell and back

[Verse 2]
I wonder how you treasure what anyone would call a flaw
You say a pearl without the pressure wouldn't be a pearl at all
When my demons come a-callin', you don’t even bat an eye
I don’t scare you, and I guess that’s why

[Chorus]
You didn't save me
You didn't think I needed saving
You didn't change me
You didn't think I needed changing
My wings are frayed and what's left of my halo's black
Lucky for me, your kind of heaven's been to Hell and back
To Hell and back

[Bridge]
Smoke was coming off my jacket
And I left a long trail of ashes

[Chorus]
You didn't save me
You didn't think I needed saving
You didn't change me
You didn't think I needed changing
My wings are frayed and what's left of my halo's black
Lucky for me, your kind of heaven's been to Hell and back
Lucky for me, your kind of heaven's been to Hell and back
To Hell and back
To Hell and back"
Maren Morris,I Wish I Was,"[Verse 1]
On paper, we go together
I know that we look the part
But almost never hangs on forever
I know I'm breakin' your heart

[Pre-Chorus]
So go on, say what you want to
I'm not gonna stop you
You can blame it all on me, mm

[Chorus]
I'm not the hero in the story
I'm not the girl that gets the glory
'Cause you're lookin' for true love
And I'm not the one
But I wish, but I wish I was
Mm, I wish, oh, I wish I was
Mm-mm

[Verse 2]
Wish I could feel about ya
The way you feel about me
But you can't make a heart say somethin'
That it don't believe

[Pre-Chorus]
So go on, hate me if you have to
I hate myself, too
'Cause as much as I wanna be

[Chorus]
I'm not the hero in the story
I'm not the girl that gets the glory

Go on, hate me if you have to
I still care about you

Maren Morris,I Could Use a Love Song,"[Verse 1]
Usually a drink will do the trick
Take the edge off quick, sittin' in the dark
With a shared cigarette
Seeing eye-to-eye and heart-to-heart
But maybe I'm just gettin' old
Used to work, but now it don't

[Verse 2]
A long gone drive
You know the kind where you take a turn
And you don't know why
But it clears your mind, a surefire cure
I need somethin' stronger
That'll last a little longer

[Chorus]
I could use a love song
That takes me back, just like that
When it comes on
To a time when I wouldn't roll my eyes
At a guy and a girl
Who make it work in a world
That for me so far just seems to go so wrong
Yeah, I could use, I could use a love song

[Verse 3]
I wish I didn't know so much
I peeked behind the curtain
Now that magic rush
Feels like a trick that isn't workin'
But I haven't lost all hope yet
Yeah, it's hurtin', but it ain't dead

[Chorus]
I could use a love song
That takes me back, just like that
When it comes on
To a time when I wouldn't roll my eyes
At a guy and a girl
Who make it work in a world
That for me so far just seems to go so wrong
Yeah, I could use, I could use a love song

[Bridge]
Give me a sign or a rhyme or a reason
Just somethin' that I can believe in

[Chorus]
I could use a love song
That takes me back, just like that
When it comes on
To a time when I wouldn't roll my eyes
At a guy and a girl
Who make it work in a world
That for me so far just seems to go so wrong
Yeah, I could use
Yeah, I could use, I could use a love song"
Maren Morris,Kiss the Sky,"[Verse 1]
The unfamiliar road could be the same place you get lost and find yourself
There might be bumps, there might be bruises, but at least you'll have a story to tell
Time'll slip on by if you're stuck here livin' life with too much caution
And I know you know that those wings, they weren't made for walkin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's safe where you are
But safe only gets you so far

[Chorus]
What if you look your fears right in the eye?
Say you'll see them another time?
What if, for once
You can find the piеce of you that you've been hidin', you've been hidin'?
What if you chasе your heart out to the edge?
Rewrite your stars and be brave instead?
What if you jump
And the fallin' feels a little like you're flyin', like you're flyin'?

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, my darlin', if you try
You just might kiss the sky

[Verse 2]
Ideas, comin' to you like a spark that starts a fire in your mind
But ideas can only burn you if you always keep 'em locked up inside
Time will slip on by if you're stuck here livin' life with too much caution
So go out in this world and get every single thing you ever wanted

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's safe where you are
But safe only gets you so far

[Chorus]
What if you look your fears right in the eye?
Say you'll see them another time?
What if, for once
You can find the piece of you that you've been hidin', you've been hidin'?
What if you chase your heart out to the edge?
Rewrite your stars and be brave instead
What if you jump?
And the fallin' feels a little like you're flyin', like you're flyin'?

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, my darlin', if you try
You just might kiss the sky

[Outro]
You just might kiss the sky
Ooh, you just might kiss the sky
You just might kiss the sky
Oh yeah, yeah"
Maren Morris,Kingdom of One,"[Verse 1]
First light, a sacrifice
Bird's eye, saw the signs
Cold nights will take your life
Reach out and touch your faith
Give up on everything
To carry the world on a string

[Pre-Chorus]
All you can give, all you can bear
All that you longed for, nothing compares
When nothing is sacred, no one is safe

[Chorus]
So you wanna play God? Come on
Is that all you got? Come on
Would you sell your soul? Burn it all
Everything that you love
Finally become second to none
In a kingdom of one

[Verse 2]
Dig down, far below
Lost souls feed the crows
Hell's fire keeps you warm

[Pre-Chorus]
All you can give, all you can bear
Look to your heart, but nothing is there
When nothing is sacred, no one is safe

[Chorus]
So you wanna play God? Come on
Is that all you got? Come on
Would you sell your soul? Burn it all
Everything that you love
Finally become second to none
In a kingdom of one
In a kingdom of one

[Bridge]
Come on
Come on
Come on
Come on

[Chorus]
So you wanna play God? Come on
Is that all you got? Come on
Would you sell your soul? Burn it all
Everything that you love
Ash to ash, dust to dust
Everything and God above
Shed a tear, shed your blood
No, you cannot give enough
Finally become second to none
In a kingdom of one"
Maren Morris,Drunk Girls Don’t Cry,"[Intro]
Hey, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Hey, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na

[Verse 1]
What you do with trash? You take it out
So why are you lettin' him hang around?
Girl, you gotta know when to clean house
And throw his shit out in the yard
If it was the first time, I would understand
But it's the third time, he got a second chance
There's a fine line between an accident
And an L-O-S-E-R

[Pre-Chorus]
It's bullshit, you know it
Yeah, I see it in your eyes
Every time that you tell me
Deep down, he's a really good guy

[Chorus]
That's like sayin' drunk girls don't cry
Girl, you must be outta your damn mind
You say he saw the light, the slate is clean
Swears up and down that it's gonna be
Different this time
That's like sayin' drunk girls don't cry (Hey, na-na-na-na)
La-da-da-da-da-da-da (Na-na-na-na)
La-da-da-da-da-da-da (Na-na-na-na)

[Verse 2]
Another weekend, another box of wine
I heard it so much, I got it memorized
If you think he's the one, then you must be blind
Or C-R-A-Z-Y, come on

[Pre-Chorus]
It's bullshit, you know it
I wish I had a dime for
Every time that you tell me
Deep down, he's a really good guy

[Chorus]
That's like sayin' drunk girls don't cry
Girl, you must be outta your damn mind
You say he saw the light, the slate is clean
Swears up and down that it's gonna be

Maren Morris,Space,"[Verse 1]
Well, you really did it this time
Everyone watched as you took the stars right out of my sky
The light out of my eyes
I don't need a drink or a good conversation
Or the talk of this town all around me
I'm broken, embarrassed, I know there's nowhere I can go
All I know is that I need space

[Chorus]
If it takes a rocket, okay
Somewhere more than a planet away
I wave to the man in the moon
Put a lightyear between me and you
I need space

[Verse 2]
You really messed with my head
Knocked me off of my axis
I would get out of bed
But around here, the fact is
No one who's willing to listen will listen without taking sides of the story
Gravity's holding me here, but if I had a say, all I'd say
Is that I need space

[Chorus]
If it takes a rocket, okay
Somewhere more than a planet away
I wave to the man in the moon
Put a lightyear between me and you
I need space (Ooh-ooh)

[Outro]
I wave to the man in the moon
Nowhere to be and nothing to do
With a lightyear between me and you
I need space
I need space
I need space"
Maren Morris,The Tree,"[Verse 1]
I'm done fillin' a cup with a hole in the bottom
I'm takin' an axe to the tree
The rot at the roots is the root of the problem
But you wanna blame it on me

[Verse 2]
I hung around longer than anyone should
You've broken my heart more than anyone could
Tryin' to stop me won't do you no good
I've already planted the seeds

[Chorus]
Ooh, do you hear that?
It's the sound of a new wind blowin'
Ooh, do you feel that?
Heart lettin' go of the weight it's been holdin'
I've made miracles in the shadows
But now that I'm out in the sun
I'll never stop growin', wherever I'm goin'
Hope I'm not the only one

[Verse 3]
I'm done fillin' a cup with a hole in the bottom
And screamin' the truth to a liar
Spent ten thousand hours tryna fight it with flowers
And the tree was already on fire
Yeah, the tree was already on fire

[Chorus]
Ooh, do you hear that?
It's the sound of a new wind blowin'
Ooh, do you feel that?
Heart lettin' go of the weight it's been holdin'
I've made miracles in the shadows
But now that I'm out in the sun
I'll never stop growin', wherever I'm goin'
Hope I'm not the only one

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, hey
Ooh, ooh

[Bridge]
Ooh, do you see that?
It's the light of a better day dawnin'
Ooh, do you hear that?
It's the sound of a tree fallin'

[Chorus]
Ooh, do you hear that?
It's the sound of a new wind blowin'
Ooh, do you feel that?
Heart lettin' go of the weight it's been holdin'
I've made miracles in the shadows
But now that I'm out in the sun
I'll never stop growin', wherever I'm goin'
Hope I'm not the only one

Hope I'm not the only one
Hope I'm not the only one"
Maren Morris,Even When I’m Not,"[Chorus]
I'm gonna live forever in you
Long as the sky and oceans are blue
I'll always love you and I'll never stop
I'll always be there, even when I'm not

[Verse 1]
I know the world can turn into a lonely place
Can break your heart and paint the teardrops on your face
I might not be beside you, but I won't be far
I'll be lookin' over you like Northern Stars
On nights your mind is spiralin' like desert winds
The way you wanna go is not the way you've been
Darlin', don't be scared of what's around the bend
But when you feel alone, I hope you never forget, oh

[Chorus]
I'm gonna live forever in you
Long as the sky and oceans are blue
I'll always love you and I'll never stop
I'll always be there, even when I'm not
Even when I'm not, oh

[Verse 2]
I hope you never hesitate and waste those wings
I hope you dance under the rain the storm cloud brings
You can win the battle, but you can't beat time
When I'm no longer with you, know that I, oh, I

[Chorus]
I'm gonna live forever in you
Long as the sky and oceans are blue
I'll always love you and I'll never stop
I'll always be there, even when I'm not

[Post-Chorus]
Even when I'm not
Even when I'm, when I'm not (I'll be there)
Even when I'm not
Even when I'm, when I'm not (I'll be there)
Even when I'm far
Feel the rhythm in your heart (I'll be there)
Even when I'm not"
Maren Morris,Common,"[Intro: Maren Morris]
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm

[Verse 1: Maren Morris]
I've been tryna carry on
But I'm crushed under the weight
Of the world where I belong
But I don't feel at home, yeah
When it's over, when it's done
When we're standing at the gates
Will we see that all along, yeah
We're a different kind of same?

[Pre-Chorus: Maren Morris]
How do we get to the bottom of this
When we're sitting on the top?
Hey, the people, they tell me it's just how it is
Like it's never gonna stop

[Chorus: Maren Morris]
But we got way too much in common
So what's the point in fighting?
We got way too many problems if I'm being honest
I don't know what God is
'Cause we've got way too much in common (Mmm, mmm)
Way too much in common (Mmm, mmm)
Way too much in common

[Verse 2: Brandi Carlile]
I breathe it in my lungs
I've seen it in the flesh
If all we need is love
How the hell did we forget?

How do we get to the bottom of this
When we're sitting at the top?
People, they tell me it's just how it is
Like it's never gonna stop

Oh, we got way too much in common
So what's the point in fighting?
We got way too many problems if I'm being honest (Yeah)
I don't know what God is

Maren Morris,Company You Keep,"[Verse 1]
Everyone's always talkin' 'bout their favorite destination
Where they're gonna go on their next vacation
Gotta make that flashy reservation
Don't wanna wait in line
But when I'm sittin' on the couch and I'm lookin' at the pictures
The background's only a secondary fixture
Where we went for dinner, shoot, I don't remember
But we had a good time

[Pre-Chorus]
Together, together
We can do whatever, whatever

[Chorus]
We can walk right up the street
Where the locals roll
We ain't gotta go international
Baby, just drive in a park and party
We don't need no Hollywood suite
Ooh, don't matter what we do
Anything with you sounds fine to me
It's all about the company you keep
Yeah, 'bout the company you keep
So come on, keep me company

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, listen

[Verse 2]
When it comes down to it, nobody really cares
Where you had your birthday, just who was there
Buy you a shot, then hold back your hair
Take you to Waffle House
We're the circles that you're runnin' when you're runnin' around
Bail you out, make you laugh, pick you up when you're down
Hangin' out in your hometown
Hey, that's what it's all about

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever, whatever
We're all in it together, birds of a feather

[Chorus]
We can walk right up the street
Where the locals roll
We ain't gotta go international
Baby, just drive in a park and party
We don't need no Hollywood suite
Ooh, don't matter what we do
Anything with you sounds fine to me
It's all about the company you keep
Yeah, 'bout the company you keep
So come on, keep me company

So come on, keep me company"
Maren Morris,Bummin’ Cigarettes,"[Verse 1]
I need to get more sleep, I been stayin' up all night
Maybe when I drink, I need to stick to red wine
I need to pick up the phone, see what's goin' on back home
Just admit, when I'm with him, I still feel alone

[Chorus]
I been goin' down a road that's a little too traveled
I should find the common thread that makes it all unravel
Like layin' down my dollar just for a temporary high
I gotta quit bummin' cigarettes from the wrong guys

[Verse 2]
I should slow this train and take my own advice
Stop sayin' that some day, I'm gonna make it right
It's just a red light, it's just a wrong turn
Another drag on a Friday night
It's about time I learned

[Chorus]
I been goin' down a road that's a little too traveled
I should find the common thread that makes it all unravel
Like layin' down my dollar just for a temporary high
And I gotta quit bummin' cigarettes from the wrong guys
Oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
I been goin' down a road that's a little too traveled
I should find the common thread that makes it all unravel
Like layin' down my dollar just for a temporary high
I gotta quit bummin' cigarettes from the wrong guys

[Outro]
Stop layin' down my heart and find my own light
I got to quit bummin' cigarettes from the wrong guys"
Maren Morris,All My Favorite People,"[Verse 1: Maren Morris]
Not everybody drinks on a Tuesday night
Mixes their liquor with Crystal Light
With a couple of friends they called out of the blue
And not everybody spends what they made that week
On a tank of gas and a little bit of weed
But all my favorite people do

[Chorus: Maren Morris]
I don't know about them, but I know about us
It is what it is and we love who we love
Not everybody gets what we’re going through
But all my favorite people do
Yeah, all my favorite people do

[Post-Chorus: Maren Morris]
Come on, TJ

[Verse 2: TJ Osborne]
Not everybody's gonna find clarity
In a back porch sittin' kind of therapy
With a little bit of wine, John Prine, and Camel Blues (Oh no)
Not everybody leaves well enough alone
Stays out of business that ain’t their own
But all my favorite people do

[Chorus: Maren Morris]
Well, I don't know about them, but I know about us
It is what it is and we love who we love
Not everybody gets what we're going through
But all my favorite people do
Yeah, all my favorite people do

[Bridge: Maren Morris]
All my favorite people, all my favorite people
All my favorite people, yeah, they do
Yeah, we ain't all perfect, but we're doing alright
Everybody's worried 'bout tryin' to get by
But all my favorite people do

[Chorus: Maren Morris]
Well, I don’t know about them, but I know about us
It is what it is and we love who we love
Not everybody gets what we’re going through
But all my favorite people do
Yeah, all my favorite people do"
Maren Morris,Sugar,"[Verse 1]
Boy, I've been cookin' up one hell of a crush
Got you on my mind the minute I wake up
You make the mornin' glow, make the rooster crow
Get my juices flowin'
You know I got the spice, but it ain't enough

[Chorus]
Baby, would you be my sugar, sugar?
Make my heart race, even on a good day
You make the world taste better, better
Good on anything, want you on everything
Just a little bit is all it takes
Like a Coca-Cola on Christmas Day
You're what I crave, babe, what can I say?
Would you, would you
Would you be my sugar, sugar? Oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Tried the fake shit, but it ain't the same
A girl just knows when it's the real thing
Yeah, I'm a cup of tea with a touch of cream
But something's missin'
So I'm gonna put this nice and sweet

[Chorus]
Baby, would you be my sugar, sugar?
Make my heart race, even on a good day
You make the world taste better, better
Good on anything, want you on everything
Just a little bit is all it takes
Like a Coca-Cola on Christmas Day
You're what I crave, babe, what can I say?
Would you, would you
Would you be my sugar, sugar? Oh, oh
Would you be my sugar, sugar? Oh, oh, oh

[Bridge]
Sugar, sugar, you make my heart race
Even on a good day, you make the world taste
Better, better, good on anything
Just a little bit is all that it takes

Sugar, sugar
Make my heart race, even on a good day
You make the world taste better, better
Good on anything, want you on everything
Just a little bit is all it takes
Like a Coca-Cola on Christmas Day
You're what I crave, babe, what can I say?
Would you, would you
Would you be my sugar, sugar? Oh, oh
Would you be my sugar, sugar? Oh, oh, oh
Yeah"
Maren Morris,Circles Around This Town,"[Verse 1]
I swear I don't know how I trusted
A Montero with the AC busted
A couple bad demos on a burned CD
Would take me all the way to Tennessee
I showed up to the new apartment
First month's, last month's, two deposits
Hadn't heard the sound of a door slam yet
Thank God I was an optimist

[Chorus]
I drove circles around this town
Tryna write circles around this town
Tryin' to say somethin' with meanin'
Somethin' worth singin' about
I've been kind and I've been ruthless
Yeah, I got here, but the truth is
Thought when I hit it, it'd all look different
But I still got the pedal down
Drivin' circles around this town

[Verse 2]
So many times, I thought about lеavin'
Got my ass kicked tryin' to compete with
Evеrybody else's ones that got away
Hung around long enough to catch a break
A couple hundred songs and the ones that finally worked
Was the one about a car and the one about a church
That I wrote

[Chorus]
Drivin' circles around this town
Tryna write circles around this town
Tryin' to say somethin' with meanin'
Somethin' worth singin' about
I've been kind and I've been ruthless
Yeah, I got here, but the truth is
Thought when I hit it, it'd all look different
But I still got the pedal down
Drivin' circles around this town
Drivin' circles around this town
Hey

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I drove circles around this town
Tryna write circles around this town
Tryin' to say somethin' with meanin'
Somethin' worth singin' about
I've been kind and I've been ruthless
Yeah, I got here, but the truth is
Thought when I hit it, it'd all look different
But I still got the pedal down
I still get lost, I still get found
Drivin' circles around this town

[Outro]
Oh, yeah"
Maren Morris,A Song for Everything,"[Verse 1]
What's your time machine?
Is it Springsteen or ""Teenage Dream""?
What's your takes-you-back?
Your first falling-in-love soundtrack?

[Pre-Chorus]
When you were looking for the words
Somebody said it first so you didn't have to
It was looking right at you

[Chorus]
One danced you through love
One rocked you through lonely
Mixtaped your heartbreak and made you feel holy
For the hits and the misses, for the fire and rain
Close your eyes and listen
'Cause there's a song for everything, yeah
There's a song for everything

[Verse 2]
My first lighter up
Was back when Coldplay still played clubs
My first real goodbye
Damn, that second verse still makes me cry

[Pre-Chorus]
When I was looking for the words
Somebody said it first like they knew me
They were singing right to me

[Chorus]
One danced you through love
One rocked you through lonely
Mixtaped your heartbreak and made you feel holy
For the hits and the misses, for the fire and rain
Close your eyes and listen

Maren Morris,Get The Hell Out Of Here,"[Verse 1]
Watered the garden, but forgot to fill the well
I fed all my good intentions while I starved myself
So to startin' conversations that only end in tears
Go on, get the hell out of here

[Verse 2]
I've gone against the grain and good advice
I drank my weight to dehydrate the thoughts that flood my mind
So to all my grand apologies I know are insincere
Go on, get the hell out of here

[Chorus]
I do the best I can
But the more I hang around here, the less I give a damn
So to all the doubts and demons that I held so dear
Go on, get the hell out of here

[Verse 3]
I handed out my heart on paper plates
I believed all the love, I believed all the hate
So to sharin' every part of me so I don't disappear
Go on, get the hell out of here

[Chorus]
I do the best I can
But the more I hang around here, the less I give a damn
So to all the doubts and demons that I held so dear
Go on, get the hell out of here

[Post-Chorus]
(Ooh)

[Bridge]
I don't know what I'm doin'
Don't know what I'm tryin' to find
My only resolution is I'm allowed to change my mind
So to all the grace I never gave myself
Go to hell

[Chorus]
I do the best I can
But the more I hang around here, the less I give a damn
So to all the doubts and demons that I held so dear
I only got room for heaven this year
So go on, get the hell out of here"
Maren Morris,Make Out With Me,"[Intro]
This is the end of Side One of this record
Please now turn it over for the second side

[Verse 1]
I got a phone that won't die
You're up in the air, landing tonight
So I'll leave a message for ya, get it when you touch down
If I'm being honest, I'm a little drunk now
I got a bed that's too big without ya
I got a heart that don't beat without ya
Get so jealous when you ain't by my side
I know it's selfish, but I need you tonight

[Chorus]
So text when you touch down, straight to my place now
These nights without you, they're so hard to sleep
Come put your things down, I'll order take out
No more to say now, baby, just make out with me
Baby, just make out with me

[Verse 2]
You got a kiss I still taste
And I feel your lips from miles away
I got one more minute of this message to burn
I hope you get it 'cause I mean every word

[Chorus]
So text when you touch down, straight to my place now
These nights without you, they're so hard to sleep
Come put your things down, I'll order take out
No more to say now, baby, just make out with me

Just like it used to be, baby, just make out with me"
Brothers Osborne,Stay A Little Longer,"[Verse 1]
Yeah, something of a strong wind is coming over me
It's got a hold of me, yeah
Thinking and doing things I shouldn't be
I really I shouldn't be

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, but one more call
It's the one more “What'cha doing right now?”
It's the one more trip to my side of town and you walk right in
It's the one more here we go again

[Chorus]
One more drink leads to another
You slide up close to me
Tearin' t-shirts off each other
Your hands all over me
I tell myself I'm not in love
But one more time is not enough
One last kiss and then you're a goner
I'm lyin' here, wishin' you could stay a little longer

So calm and so cool, yeah I try to be
Like it don't bother me
The last time was the last time
Until I'm all alone, then I'm picking up the phone

Brothers Osborne,Shoot Me Straight,"[Verse 1]
Don't give me that look, that let-me-down-easy smile

So pour it on like a shot of whiskey and shoot me straight

[Verse 2]
I've got some friends who'd love to go raise some hell
A couple old flames to help me bid you farewell
There's plenty of time and alcohol from happy hour to last call
So do whatcha gotta do so I can get to gettin' over you and

[Chorus]
Make it burn the whole way down
Lay my six-foot-four-inch ass out on the ground
Yeah, tomorrow, I'll have me a hard hangover and one hell of a heartache
So pour it on like a shot of whiskey and shoot me straight

[Bridge]
Don't give me that salt shaker and lime
Don't give me that come-back chaser this time
Don't muddle it up, don't water it down
Give me everything you got right here, right now
And make it burn

[Chorus]
Make it burn the whole way down
Lay my six-foot-four-inch ass out on the ground
Yeah, tomorrow, I'll have me a hard hangover and one hell of a heartache
Pour it on like a shot of whiskey and shoot me straight

[Post-Chorus]
Shoot me straight, come on
(Come on, come on, come on, come on now)
Yeah"
Brothers Osborne,I Don’t Remember Me (Before You),"[Verse 1]
Did I stop and watch the sunset fade?
What gave me life and took my breath away?
Did I take a last-call stranger home
So I wouldn't have to wake up alone?

[Chorus]
I heard I was a wild one
Actin like a child, son
But I really don't recall
Heard I was a fast one
Always was the last one
Waitin' for the other shoe to fall
I've seen pictures
And I've heard stories
'Bout the boy I used to be
But I don't remember me

[Verse 2]
Was I just another ghost in this town?
Who was I when no one was around?
Did I even know what I was livin' without?
Who are my favorite songs about?

[Chorus]
I heard I was a wild one
Actin like a child, son
But I really don't recall
Heard I was a fast one
Always was the last one
Waitin' for the other shoe to fall
I've seen pictures
And I've heard stories
'Bout the boy I used to be
But I don't remember me

[Bridge]
Was my heart beatin' in my chest?
And was I even alive before the day we met?

[Chorus]
I heard I was a wild one
Actin' like a child, son
Heard I was a fast one
Always was the last one
Waitin' for the other shoe to fall
I've seen pictures
And I've heard stories
'Bout the boy I used to be
But I don't remember me
No, I don't remember me before you"
Brothers Osborne,I’m Not For Everyone,"[Verse 1]
Some people clap on the one and three
Some people clap on the two and four
Some people don't join at all 'cause they got no rhythm
And that's alright
Some people, they drink too much
Some people don't drink enough
Some people are just like me
I hope y'all forgive 'em

[Chorus]
I'm like scotch and zydeco bands
I'm like B-side Townes Van Zandt
I'm always speaking my mind
When I'm better off biting my tongue
I'm a bad joke at the wrong time
Hell, I'm a legend in my own mind
I'm good for some but I'm not for everyone

[Verse 2]
If I was sweet tea, it'd be a bit bitter
If you took a drink, you might reconsider
If I was a church, I'd be hanging with the sinners
Talking 'bout Hendrix and Heaven
If I was a bar, I'd be a dive
A free jukebox in a double-wide
Neon lights saying ""Come inside""
And I'd be ""Open 24/7""

[Chorus]
I'm like scotch and zydeco bands
I'm like B-side Townes Van Zandt
I'm always speaking my mind
When I'm better off biting my tongue
I'm a bad joke at the wrong time
Hell, I'm a legend in my own mind
I'm good for some but I'm not for everyone

[Bridge]
Yeah, I'm hard to love, it's true
I'm a little more rough than smooth
It's a wonder I found somebody like me, like you

[Chorus]
I'm like scotch and zydeco bands
I'm like B-side Townes Van Zandt
I'm always speaking my mind
When I'm better off biting my tongue
I'm a bad joke at the wrong time
Hell, I'm a legend in my own mind
I'm good for some but I'm not for everyone
Yeah, I'm good for some but I'm not for everyone"
Brothers Osborne,All Night,"[Intro]
Woo!

[Verse 1]
I got the good if you got the time
I got the moon if you got the shine
I got the back if you got the beat
Got that solid gold country 33 on repeat

[Chorus]
All night
Get, get, get to livin', feelin' alright
Dancin' out the denim in 'em, oh my, Levi's

All night
All night
Woo!

I got the rebel if you got the yell (Hey)

Get, get, get to livin', feelin' alright
Dancin' out the denim in 'em, oh my, Levi's

What good is a saint if you ain't got the sinnin'?
What good is a life if you don't get to livin'?
What good is the one if you ain't got the other?
Takes two to tango, let's get this thing goin'

[Chorus]
All night
Get, get, get to livin', feelin' alright
Dancin' out the denim in 'em, oh my, Levi's

Brothers Osborne,21 Summer,"[Verse 1]
Now and then
I think about you now and then
When I see that Chevrolet
That certain shade of blue
I hear that song, the one we sang all summer long
And even though it's been so long it brings me back
Right back to you

[Chorus]
I hope you find the storm that you were chasing
Hope your eyes are still as full of dreams
As they were that night when you slipped off those cut off jeans
When I hear the sound of high tide thunder
I can see your hair blowing in the breeze
I think about how you and that 21 summer made a man of me
Yeah, you made a man of me

[Verse 2]
How you been?
I'd love to hear 'bout how you've been
You're the only broken heart I've ever had
And love to have again

[Chorus]
I hope you find the storm that you were chasing
Hope your eyes are still as full of dreams
As they were that night when you slipped off those cut off jeans
When I hear the sound of high tide thunder
I can see your hair blowing in the breeze
I think about how you and that 21 summer made a man of me
Yeah, you made a man of me
Yeah, you made a man of me"
Brothers Osborne,Love the Lonely Out of You,"[Verse 1]
I can tell that you're lonely
Pour it all out on me
Because I have been lonely too
That's a heartache you're drinkin'
And I can feel what you're thinkin'
Let's do what the lonely do

[Chorus]
Your lips, your shoulders and my fingertips
Runnin' through your hair, just like this
Whatever it takes to make your heart forget
I'll do
Baby, let me love the lonely out of you

[Verse 2]
Take everything that makes you sad
Let it out and leave it in the past
You don't need that for what I've got in mind
Wrap those arms around me
Close your eyes and baby you'll see
It ain't that hard to leave it all behind

[Chorus]
Your lips, your shoulders and my fingertips
Runnin' through your hair, just like this
Whatever it takes to make your heart forget
I'll do
Baby, let me love the lonely out of you

[Chorus]
Your lips, your shoulders and my fingertips
Runnin' through your hair, just like this
Whatever it takes to make your heart forget
I'll do
Baby, let me love the lonely out of you"
Brothers Osborne,Pushing Up Daisies (Love Alive),"[Verse 1]
I'd promise you forever if I could
If I could slow down the hands of time I would
I know they say all good things must end
If I could do it all over I would do it all over
Over and over again

[Chorus]
We'll go on 'til were pushin' up daisies
We'll grow old and wild and I'll still be callin' you baby
We'll never get enough, we'll be livin' it up right down to the day we die
Naw, we ain't gettin' out of this love alive

[Verse 2]
'Til I held you close I never felt the feelin'
And now I'll feel that way 'til the last sunset goes down
You turned a stubborn southern boy into a believer
Believe me when I say, it's gonna stay that way 'til they lay me in the ground

[Chorus]
We'll go on 'til we're pushing up daisies
We'll grow old and wild and I'll still be callin' you baby
We'll never get enough, we'll be livin' it up right down to the day we die
Naw, we ain't gettin' out of this love alive

[Chorus]
We'll go on 'til were pushing up daisies
We'll be old and wild and I'll still be callin' you baby
We'll never get enough, we'll be livin' it up right down to the day we die

When our last breath is gone
And they carve our name in stone
Oh, we ain't gettin' out of this love alive"
Brothers Osborne,"Weed, Whiskey and Willie","[Chorus]
I've got bottles and vinyl stacked to the ceilin'
I get stoned for survival, it helps with the healin'
And when it all goes to hell, the only thing I believe in
Is weed, whiskey, and Willie

[Verse 1]
You can take the ring
You can take or leave my name
You can have my heart
It's broken anyway
You can take my reputation
And drag it through the mud, go on and abuse it
But don't take my smoke, my jug of brown liquor
Or my country music

[Chorus]
I've got bottles and vinyl stacked to the ceilin'
I get stoned for survival, it helps with the healin'
And when it all goes to hell, the only thing I believe in
Is weed, whiskey, and Willie

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Turn the music up
I'm gonna lock all the doors
Turn off the lights and close every blind
There ain't nobody home
And the pictures on the wall
Are just about lost in a cloud of smoke
My vices and heroes will hold me together
When I'm lettin' you go

[Chorus]
I've got bottles and vinyl stacked to the ceilin'
I get stoned for survival, it helps with the healin'
And when it all goes to hell, the only thing I believe in
Is weed, whiskey, and Willie

And when I'm back on my feet, I'm gon' keep on repeatin'
Weed, whiskey, and Willie"
Brothers Osborne,While You Still Can,"Make amends with that old friend
You swore you'd never never talk to again
Because you miss him
Call up your mom on the telephone
Talk a whole lot of nothing til the cows come home
And listen
Cross every T, dot most the I's
'Cause years grow wings and fly on by
And time slips through your fingers just like sand

Because everything you thought would last forever
Never lasts forever, like you plan
Don't let your night become another
So take life by the hands while you still can

Get your daddy to tell that same old joke
And laugh between the jack and coke
And hope one day you'll be half as funny
Count your blessings and your stars
It's in the air and who you are
It's about the wealth you give
It sure as hell ain't about the money

Because everything you thought would last forever
Never lasts forever like you plan
Don't let your now become a never
So take life by the hands while you still can

You just imagine
Anything can happen if you live every moment like your last

Because everything you thought would last forever
Never lasts forever like you plan
Don't let your now become a never
So take life by the hands while you still can"
Brothers Osborne,Skeletons,"[Verse 1]
I heard you been creepin' 'round
'Bout the time that sun goes down
You been talkin' in your sleep and
It's been goin' on for weeks and I been
Solvin' puzzle pieces
High time to come to Jesus

[Chorus]
You got skeletons in your closet
It's written all over your face
Every little lie, stacked so high
Can't keep your story straight
I don't know how they got there
It's getting under my skin
You got skeletons in your closet
And I got bones to pick with them, oh

[Verse 2]
I was born in the morning
But I wasn't born yesterday
Deep into your inventory's
Gonna send me to an early grave, yeah

[Chorus]
You got skeletons in your closet
It's written all over your face
Every little lie, stacked so high
Can't keep your story straight
I don't know how they got there
It's getting under my skin
You got skeletons in your closet
And I got bones to pick with them

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Well, you got skeletons in your closet
It's written all over your face
Every little lie, stacked so high
Can't keep your story straight
I don't know how they got there
It's getting under my skin
You got skeletons in your closet
And I got bones to pick with—
Bones to pick with—
Bones to pick with them, hey!"
Brothers Osborne,Tequila Again,"[Verse 1]
I'll never forget the first time I kissed her
And that's where the story begins
At a dive bar named Dina's in Encinatas
We met through a mutual friend
Had a hell of a time, yeah we went all night
By morning, she messed up my head
I swore her off, but I'd be damned I fell in love
With tequila again

[Chorus]
And we lost our minds, we danced all night
Picked up right where we left off
Raised hell with the boys, made all kinds of noise
Singing at the top of our lungs
Yeah once again I'll wake up on tile
With a headache turned up to ten
Asking myself why the hell I fell in love
With tequila again

[Verse 2]
I've had some lovers, loved some more than others
They've all been a bittersweet buzz
And I've had some vices, most more than twice
And none does me quite like she does
I try to forget her, wish I'd never met her
But I'll let her waltz right on in
Now come Friday night I'll fall right back
In love with tequila again

[Chorus]
We'll lose our minds, we'll dance all night
Picked up right where we left off
Raise hell with the boys, make all kinds of noise
Singing at the top of our lungs
Yeah once again I'll wake up on tile
With a headache turned up to ten
Asking myself why the hell I fell in love
With tequila again

[Outro]
They laid me down, I'll fall in and out of love
With tequila again"
Brothers Osborne,Younger Me,"[Verse 1]
Hey younger me
Made it harder than it had to be
Trying hard to dodge my destiny
But get the best of me

Yeah younger me
Way too young to pace the bedroom floor
Always dreamed of kicking down the door
What were you waiting for

Yeah younger me
Was as reckless as he should have been
Close calls and down falls and getting back up again
Doing it all again

Yeah younger me
Overthinking losing sleep at night
Contemplating if it's worth the fight
If he only knew he’d be all right
Yeah younger me

[Chorus]
Youth ain't wasted on the young
These trips around the sun
I needed every one
To get where I'm standing
Now it’s an uphill road to run
For my father's son
Keep it together it won't be that way forever

[Verse 2]
Younger me
Hanging out but not quite fitting in
Didn't know that being different
Really wouldn't be the end
Yeah younger me

[Chorus]
Youth ain't wasted on the young
These trips around the sun
I needed every one
To get where I'm standing
Now it's an uphill road to run
For my father’s son
Keep it together it won’t be that way forever

[Outro]
Younger me
You got me where I am today
Got a few things right along the way
You'll see just wait
Yeah younger me"
Brothers Osborne,A Little Bit Trouble,"[Verse 1]
Every thing about you says I should probably get going
But everything about me says I wanna stay right here
Everybody's got some things better off not knowing
That's just the same for us, might be a little dangerous
Heard somebody say you're a little heart breaker
Sooner or later I'll wake up and you'll be gone
The way that you got me feeling right now
Got me thinking about how I don't care if they're wrong
You can break my heart all night long

[Chorus]
No, you, you're a little bit trouble
No, you, baby that's just fine
Because you're easy on my mind
Easy on my mind

[Verse 2]
Whoever said nothing good ever happens after midnight
Has probably never seen how the moonlight shines on you
Let's take a little chance and our romance dancing in the headlights
Let's lose track of time, with your skin on mine

[Chorus]
No, you, you're a little bit trouble
No, you, baby that's just fine
Because you're easy on my mind
Easy on my mind

[Bridge]
The way that you got me feeling right now
Got me thinking about how I don't care if they're wrong
Because you can break my heart all night long

No, you, you're a little bit trouble
No, you, baby that's just fine
Because you're easy on my mind
Easy on my mind"
Brothers Osborne,Rum,"[Verse 1]
Starin' at the prettiest part of this powder keg world
Sittin' with the finest example of a beautiful girl
If we hadn't hit the brakes, we'd have no idea
Paradise was hiding right here

[Chorus]
Dipping our toes in the water
I don't care if it gets any hotter
It's you, and me rememberin' how to have fun
Let's put our hearts together
Two parts love and a pinch of good weather
And top it all off with the sun
And mix it with rum, mmm mmm mm-mm

[Verse 2]
Came out here to do a whole lot of nothing
And we're doing pretty good I think
The only one thing we need to worry about
Is filling up when the ice cubes clink

[Chorus]
Dipping our toes in the water
I don't care if it gets any hotter
It's you, and me remembering how to have fun
Let's put our hearts together
Two parts love and a pinch of good weather
And top it all off with the sun
And mix it with rum, mmm mmm mm-mm
Mix it with rum, mmm mmm mm-mm

[Bridge]
Lucky folks go to the ocean
The lakes for the land-locked ones
We got a tarp and a truck bed
A kiddie pool, a slip and slide
Let that garden hose run

[Chorus]
Dipping our toes in the water
I don't care if it gets any hotter
It's you, and me remembering how to have fun
Let's put our hearts together
Two parts love and a pinch of good weather
And top it all off with the sun
And mix it with rum, mmm mmm-mm-mm
And mix it with rum, mmm mmm mm-mm
And mix it with rum, mmm mmm mm-mm"
Brothers Osborne,Drank Like Hank,"[Verse 1]
Woke up dead, head poundin' like a kick-drum
Red-eyed, cotton mouthed,  smoke-filled black lung
Cigarette burnin' holes in a fold-out couch
Must've had one hell of a time, no doubt

[Chorus]
And I'm hazin' out of line
Found a buzz and a hundred-proof chug and I lost my mind
Ain't got a drop left in the tank
Not a nickel left in the bank
Yeah, we partied like The Possum and we drank like Hank

[Verse 2]
I remember feedin' twenties in a honky-tonk jukebox
Stepped up and ate shit in a pot-hole parkin' lot
I gave a damn good cussin' to a big doorman
Might have dotted my eye, but I'd do it again

[Chorus]
And I'm hazin' out of line
Found a buzz and a hundred-proof chug and I lost my mind
Ain't got a drop left in the tank
Not a nickel left in the bank
Yeah, we partied like The Possum and we drank like Hank

[Chorus]
And I'm hazin' out of line
Found a buzz and a hundred-proof chug and I lost my mind
Ain't got a drop left in the tank
Not a nickel left in the bank
Yeah, we partied like The Possum and we drank like Hank

[Outro]
Yeah we sang like Mickey Gilley
Smoked ourselves silly
When we partied like The Possum and we drank like Hank"
Brothers Osborne,Rollercoaster (Forever And A Day),"[Verse 1]
Where are all the songs for people who don't always get along
When breakin' up and makin' up is somethin' we all do
Couldn't find a lyric to describe this road we're on
So, I found a pen and paper and I wrote this song for you

[Chorus]
When I am winter, you are summer
When I am autumn, you are spring
When I'm high and dry, you're my drop of rain
Sometimes fallin', sometimes flyin'
But in spite of everythin'
I could ride this rollercoaster for forever and a day
I could ride this rollercoaster for forevеr and a day

[Verse 2]
The next versе didn't come as easy
Ain't that how love goes
Sometimes you just can't write the words in time to right the wrongs
But every wrong still has a reason, heaven only knows
So, even when this pen runs dry, I'll still be writin' on

[Chorus]
When I am winter, you are summer
When I am autumn, you are spring
When I'm high and dry, you're my drop of rain
Sometimes fallin', sometimes flyin'
But in spite of everythin'
I could ride this rollercoaster for forever and a day
I could ride this rollercoaster for forever and a day

[Chorus]
When I am winter, you are summer
When I am autumn, you are spring
When I'm high and dry, you're my drop of rain
Sometimes fallin', sometimes flyin'

I could ride this rollercoaster for forever and a day
I could ride this rollercoaster for forever and a day"
Brothers Osborne,Heart Shaped Locket,"[Verse 1]
The sun's goin' down and I'm just hearin' 'bout you goin' out with friends
You're in a dress I've never seen before, and your lipstick's the deepest shade of red
Your kiss goodbye don't hit quite right
And neither does your alibi
Yeah baby, do your thing
Go on and have a good time

[Chorus]
I don't believe it
You got me feeling like a pistol
Whatever you say
Who's in your heart shaped locket?

[Verse 2]
Sittin' in the dark, tellin' myself everything's cool
I'm not the jealous type, but I'm startin' to feel like a heart-broke fool
Sippin' on a half drunk pint and it's startin' to rattle up my brain
Are my instincts right or am I drinkin' myself insane?

[Chorus]
I don't believe it
You got me feeling like a pistol
Whatever you say
Who's in your heart shaped locket?

[Bridge]
You just got home, must've lost your keys
'Cause you're sneakin' in the window
You see me sittin' there, you don't say a thing
'Cause you know that I know

[Chorus]
I don't believe it
You got me feeling like a pistol
Whatever you say
Who's in your heart shaped locket?
I don't believe it
You got me feeling like a pistol
Whatever you say
Who's in your heart shaped locket?

I don't believe it
You got me feeling like a pistol
Whatever you say
Who's in your heart shaped locket?"
Brothers Osborne,All The Good Ones Are,"[Verse 1]
Not every party is a somebody callin' the cops

Wakin’ up, wonderin' where you are

Not every friend is a give it hell imitator
Not every habit is a good God gotta have it
Make it like a new guitar
But all the good ones are

Not every lover is a Coney Island thrill ride
A taste of honey with a crazy streak of mile wide
Cheap thrills, fire drills, fast wheels
Drive you like a stolen car
But all the good ones are

Not every drink is a Black Jack, make it double
Not every dive is a neon bomb jungle
Not every smile gonna get me in trouble
Sittin' down at the end of the bar

All the good ones are, hey

Not every lover is a Coney Island thrill ride
A taste of honey with a crazy streak of mile wide
Cheap thrills, fire drills, fast wheels
Drive you like a stolen car

Every bad decision ain't a suicide mission
Demolition right from the start

Brothers Osborne,Might As Well Be Me,"[Verse 1]
The jukebox won't rock if there's not a quarter down in it
Preacher man can't preach if there ain't anyone who's sinnin'
That dusty bottle up on the shelf
Far as I know won't drink itself
GT won't leave with no key in the ignition

Somebody gotta shake things up
Somebody gotta shut things down
Somebody gotta strike a match, break the ice
And buy the first round
Somebody gotta go all night
Somebody gotta dig down deep

Might as well be me

Kick drum won't thump if you don't put your lеad foot down
There ain't no one morе encore if there ain't no crowd

No, it ain't love without makin' it
Gets better with time and there's no time better than now, so look out

Somebody gotta shake things up
Somebody gotta shut things down
Somebody gotta strike a match, break the ice

Brothers Osborne,Slow Your Roll,"[Verse 1]
Take a little break from the rat race
Pour up a little heaven on ice
Pick it back up on Monday
Today I’m gonna testify
The lords been talking through the weather
Sunday sermon in the sun down sky
Don’t think I could say it any better
So I think I’m gonna take that advice

Slow your roll, slow your roll
It’s a down shift, deep stress, take yourself a deep breath
Watch it go up in smoke
Slow your roll, that’s right

Don’t have to be tonight
It’s harder than you think to do nothing
If you wanna do nothing right
You gotta

Slow your roll, slow your roll
It’s a down shift, deep stress, take yourself a deep breath
Watch it go up in smoke
Slow your roll, that’s right

Let’s take it down a notch

Can you almost taste it, light one up and take it
Down a notch and pop a top
Calm your country ass down
To low

Watch it go up in smoke
Slow your roll, that’s right

Grandaddy called her princess
County fair called her queen
High school called her cum laude
Most likely to succeed
Her daddy's backwood crazy
She's got two six-foot-four brothers
You take one step onto that front porch
And you one crazy motherf—
Chase will leave you breathless
Every back road in this town
She'll love you like a Sunday drive
And she'll take your poor heart down

[Chorus]
Dead man's curve, dead man's curve
No redemption, no return
Good God almighty, gonna crash and burn
Down dead man's curve
Dead man's curve, dead man's curve
Country boys ain't never gonna learn
Nobody ever makes it through that turn
Dead man's curve, dead man's curve, oh

[Verse 2]
Every man's been tempted
Greater men have tried
At best, you'll wind up dented
If you're lucky enough to survive
Now she's the finger that you're wrapped around
She's what every country song's about
She's the trouble you're looking for
She's gonna take you down and leave you comin' back for more

[Chorus]
Dead man's curve, dead man's curve
No redemption, no return
Good God almighty, gonna crash and burn
Down dead man's curve
Dead man's curve, dead man's curve
Country boys ain't never gonna learn
Nobody ever makes it through that turn
Dead man's curve (Dead man's curve)

[Bridge]
What you doing wildin' up here?
You a dead man
Yeah

[Chorus]
Dead man's curve, dead man's curve
No redemption, no return
Nobody ever makes it through that turn
Dead man's curve
Dead man's curve, dead man's curve
Country boys ain't never gonna learn
Nobody ever makes it through that turn
Dead man's curve (Dead man's curve)

[Outro]
Dead man's curve
Oh
You're comin' in way too hot
You done hit the wrong turn, boy
You're a dead man
Hahaha"
Brothers Osborne,Make It A Good One,"[Verse 1]
It don't take a million big ones to feel like a million bucks
You don't have to buy a plane ticket to get a little high and live it up
We pass through life like a bullet, it's enough to make your head spin
And as far as I know you don't get to do it again

[Chorus]
Make it a good one, make it a long one
If you're gonna pour one, make it a strong one
Give all your heart to someone
Leave nothing unsaid or undone
Life goes by 90 miles a minute
If you blink once, you might just miss it
It's a hold on tight, carnival ride around the sun
Before the day is done, make it a good one

[Verse 2]
Hold tight to the ones you love
Don't get stuck in your ways
Keep shiftin' gears to those good years that've seen better days
You ain't ever gonna find a U-Haul gettin' pulled behind a hearse
Leave the best of yourself behind ya
You ain't gonna fit it with you down in the dirt

[Chorus]
Make it a good one, make it a long one
If you're gonna pour one, make it a strong one
Give all your heart to someone
Leave nothing unsaid or undone
Life goes by 90 miles a minute
If you blink once, you might just miss it
It's a hold on tight, carnival ride around the sun
Before the day is done, make it a good one

[Bridge]
Raise your hand
Let the chips fall where they land
Take a chance and get a little wild while you can
And if you wanna make the good Lord laugh, tell 'em your plans

[Chorus]
Make it a good one
If you're gonna pour one, make it a strong one
Give all your heart to someone
Leave nothing unsaid or undone
Life goes by 90 miles a minute
If you blink once, you might just miss it
It's a hold on tight, carnival ride around the sun
It's a free-fall, havin' a ball 'cause you only get one
Make it a good one
Mm, make it a good one"
Brothers Osborne,High Note,"[Verse 1]
Tangled up in sheets when we get three sheets to the wind
That's the way we roll and, baby, here we go again
Overlookin' let's try one more time don't ever work
By sunrise this cloud nine ride will crash back down to earth

[Chorus]
While we're up here, let's just fly
While we're smilin', you go your way and I'll go mine
Before the smoke clears, let's agree that's all she wrote
Let's say goodbye, say goodbye on a high note

[Verse 2]
We know what comes next when this burn-one buzz is gone
No laughin', just rehashin' how and where it all went wrong
So why don't we just leave this thing to one night in a row
Let's do what we do best and drop that mic and go

[Chorus]
While we're up here, let's just fly
While I'm smilin', you go your way and I'll go mine
Before the smoke clears, let's agree that's all she wrote
Let's say goodbye, say goodbye on a high note

[Bridge]
Before we wind up sun up and sober
Let's ride the high like a roller coaster
Just before the joyride's over
Let's say goodbye, say goodbye, say goodbye

[Chorus]
But while we're up here, let's just fly
While we're smilin', you go your way and I'll go mine
Before the smoke clears, let's agree that's all she wrote
Let's say goodbye, say goodbye on a high note
Let's say goodbye, say goodbye on a high
Say goodbye, say goodbye, say goodbye
Say goodbye, say goodbye, say goodbye
Say goodbye, say goodbye, say goodbye
Say goodbye, say goodbye, say goodbye
On a high note, a high note"
